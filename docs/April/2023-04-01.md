### [Impact of Antarctic ice melting on Ocean currents](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/01/impact-of-antarctic-ice-melting-on-ocean-currents/)

#### **GS Paper 1/3**

 **Syllabus:** **Salient features of the World’s Physical Geography/ Conservation, Environmental Pollution and Degradation**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/rising-antarctic-ice-melt-ocean-flows-8528801/)

**Context:** According to a new study, an alarming effect on the global temperature, the marine food chain and the stability of ice shelves is being caused by the [Antarctic ice sheet’s rapid melting](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/ice-sheets/).

**Background:**

- [**Ocean currents**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/world-geography/physical-geography-of-the-world/oceanography/currents/) are the continuous, predictable, directional movement of seawater driven by gravity, wind (Coriolis Effect), and water density.
- These **overturning circulation/currents**, driven by the movement of denser water towards the sea floor, helps deliver heat, carbon, oxygen and vital nutrients (rise up from the bottom) around the globe.
- They **have been relatively stable for thousands of years**, but they are now being disrupted by the **warming climate.**

**Findings of the study:**

- **With temperatures rising** → freshwater from Antarctica’s melting ice enters the ocean → reducing the salinity and density of the surface water → diminishing downward flow to the sea’s bottom.
- Deepwater circulation in the Antarctic could weaken (**by 40% by 2050**) **at twice the rate of decline in the North Atlantic.**

**The effect of meltwater on global ocean circulation:**

- **Disrupts the base of the food chain:** As the Southern Ocean supports about three-quarters of global phytoplankton production → **impacts the marine ecosystem**.
- **Leaving more CO2 in the atmosphere:** The ocean would not be able to absorb as much CO2 as its u**pper layers become more stratified**.

### [What do Russia-China and Saudi-Iran deals mean for India?](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/01/what-do-russia-china-and-saudi-iran-deals-mean-for-india/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus:** **International Relations**

 **Context:** As Russia-China bolster ties, Saudi Arabia-Iran strike a deal (with China’s mediation), India’s tightrope walk gets tougher ahead of a number of crucial meetings – G7, G20, SCO and Quad.

**Recent global developments:**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Developments**|**Implications**|   |
|**Overall**|**For India**|
|**Iran-Saudi Arabia agreement:** In a surprise announcement, the countries decided **to re-establish full diplomatic ties** after talks mediated in China.|●       **May end Shia-Sunni rivalry** – long being part of West Asian politics<br><br>●       **End to**  **proxy conflicts** in Yemen, Lebanon, Iraq<br><br>●       **The decline of western influence, boost to Chinese influence**|●       **Iran and Saudi Arabia are both close friends of India**, so their deal is a positive<br><br>●       However, the fact that China is a guarantor of the deal **makes both countries much close to Beijing**<br><br>●       **India’s strain with Iran**, over cancelling oil imports, reducing investment in Chabahar due to US sanctions and the **I2U2** → China’s increasing presence →  **hurting India’s plans to circumvent Pakistan**<br><br>●       **Connectivity for India** via Chabahar, INSTC to Russia could also be hampered|
|**The International Criminal Court** convicted Russian President Putin in a number of alleged kidnappings of children in Ukraine.|●       Could impact Putin’s future travel<br><br>●       As none of Russia, China, the US or **India** is a signatory to the ICC, s**o this may not make a difference**||
|**Xi travels to Moscow:** A year after Putin went to Beijing and reaffirmed the relationship between them.|●       No-limits partnership<br><br>●       Not a military alliance<br><br>●       Adheres to **non-alignment, non-confrontation, and non-targeting of third countries**<br><br>●       Not allow multipolar organisations to be politicised – **indicating the current logjam at the G-20**|●       **Russia is a traditional friend and China is a traditional foe/rival**<br><br>●       China’s plans for more defence imports from Russia (remember China bought the S-400 before India) **could hurt India’s strategic interest.**<br><br>●       The new front will make **consensus at the G-20 much more difficult**|
|**Iran-Russia-China held naval exercises in the Gulf Of Oman**|While Russia and China have held joint military exercises before, **the inclusion of Iran is significant**|
|**Saudi Arabia clears decision to join SCO**|More will be known when India hosts the SCO summit this year||

**Other developments:**

- **AUKUS:** US, Australia and UK announced the 3-phase plan – a $368 Billion deal to provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines over the next 30 years.
- **Japanese PM’s visit to Delhi**: Japanese PM unveiled **Japan’s new Indo-Pacific Policy** and indicated that Japan stands against both Russia and China’s military plans.
- **US hosted a virtual Democracy Summit**: Pitching a front of democracies vs authoritarian states – deepening the global divide as
    - Neither China nor Russia was invited, but Taiwan was.
    - They called the Ukraine War – **an assault on democracy.**

**Challenges for India:** India is a common factor on both sides – **therefore it has to walk a tough tightrope** between its

- **Continental ties** (Pakistan, China, Afghanistan, Iran, Central Asia and Russia) and
- **Maritime strategy** (Quad, UK, France, Germany, EU, IOR countries- Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Mauritius, etc).

**Conclusion:**

- There is a reason that India’s current foreign policy (where there is a Quad, SCO, G-7, and G-20) of strategic autonomy and multipolarity is not so different from its traditional foreign policy of non-alignment.
- Instead of seeing non-alignment as a compulsion, **there is merit in seeing India’s traditional balancing act** as one that gives its foreign policy maximum flexibility to serve India’s needs.

### [Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) 2023 announced](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/01/foreign-trade-policy-ftp-2023-announced/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus: Indian Economy**

**Source:** [**PIB**](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1912572)**,** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/india-new-foreign-trade-policy-rupee-internationalisation-piyush-goyal-8529642/)

**Context:** Ministry of Commerce and Industry launched the **Foreign Trade Policy 2023,** which will come into effect from **April 1, 2023.**

- FTP 2023 sets a **$2 trillion target for exports of goods and services by 2030** with a shift from **incentives to remission and entitlement-based regime**.

**What is an FTP?**

A trade policy is a government policy that affects the number of goods and services a country exports and imports.

**Significance of FTP:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
||**Significance**|
|**Export Promotion**|**Increases revenue through** exports and stimulates economic growth|
|**Encourages exports** and attracts foreign investment|
|**Collaboration with States and Districts**|Facilitates **export promotion** at the regional level|
|**Economic growth**|**Reduces transaction costs** and simplifies export processes|
|It facilitates the **flow of the economy** in a country and increases foreign exchange in a country.|
|**For domestic consumer**|It aids in facilitating **free trade and liberalization** and improving the overall market for domestic consumers of a country.|

**Aim of FTP 2023:**

- To enhance the **competitiveness of Indian exports** in the global market (India’s overall exports are about to reach US $760 billion this year)
- Promote **sustainable development of the country’s trade sector**
- Make India a **leader in specific sectors** such as pharmaceuticals, engineering goods, and textiles
- To promote a **digital economy and leverage technology** to enhance the competitiveness of Indian exports.

**The Key Approach to the policy is based on these 4 pillars:**

- An incentive to **Remission** (Reduction/cancellation of a debt, duty, or penalty)
- **Export promotion through collaboration** – Exporters, States, Districts, Indian Missions
- **Ease of doing business,** reduction in transaction cost and e-initiatives and
- **Emerging Areas** – E-Commerce Developing Districts as Export Hubs and streamlining SCOMET policy

**Major Features of FTP 2023:**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Feature**|**Description**|**Significance**|
|**Process Re-Engineering and Automation**|The new policy focuses on **export promotion and development through automated IT systems** for various approvals, making it easier for MSMEs and others to access export benefits.|It will also encourage MSMEs to participate in the global market.|
|**Towns of Export Excellence**|Four new towns (Faridabad, Mirzapur, Moradabad, and Varanasi) have been designated as **Towns of Export Excellence (TEE) in addition to the existing 39 towns.** The TEEs will have priority **access to export promotion funds under the MAI scheme.**|It will **boost the exports of handlooms, handicrafts, and carpets**.|
|**Recognition of Exporters**|Exporter firms recognized with **‘status’** (e.g. 2-star, 4-star, 5-star ratings) based on export performance will now help in **skilling and training** (similar to the **‘each one teach one’** initiative)|This will help India build a **skilled manpower pool** capable of servicing a **$5 Trillion economy before 2030**.|
|**Promoting export from the districts**|The FTP aims at building partnerships with State governments and taking forward the **Districts as Export Hubs (DEH) initiative** to promote exports at the district level and accelerate the development of the grassroots trade ecosystem.|It will help in **identifying and promoting local products** and services.|
|**Streamlining SCOMET Policy**|India is placing more emphasis on the **“export control” regime** to comply with the international treaties and agreements entered into by India.<br><br>**SCOMET: “**Special Chemicals, Organism, Materials, Equipment and Technologies” items are **dual-use items** having the potential for both civilian applications as well as weapons of mass destruction.|A robust export control system in India would provide **access to dual-use High-end goods and technologies** to Indian exporters while facilitating exports of controlled items/technologies under SCOMET from India.|
|**Facilitating E-Commerce Exports**|The FTP 2023 outlines the intent and roadmap for **establishing e-commerce hubs and related elements** such as payment reconciliation, bookkeeping, returns policy, and export entitlements.|It will help Indian exporters tap into the potential of e-commerce exports and increase their global reach.|
|**Facilitation under the Export Promotion of Capital Goods (EPCG) Scheme**|The EPCG Scheme, which allows the **import of capital goods at zero Customs duty** for export production, is being further rationalized.<br><br>Additional schemes such as the **PM MITRA scheme** have been added to claim benefits under the Common Service Provider scheme.<br><br>**Battery Electric Vehicles**, Vertical Farming equipment, Wastewater Treatment and Recycling, Rainwater harvesting systems, and Green Hydrogen are added to **Green Technology products** – will now be eligible for **reduced Export Obligation requirements** under EPCG Scheme|It will **promote domestic manufacturing and encourage investment in capital goods**.|
|**Facilitation under the Advance authorization Scheme (AAS)**|AAS provides **duty-free import of raw materials** for manufacturing export items.<br><br>It has been now **extended to the export of the Apparel** and Clothing sector|It will promote domestic manufacturing and encourage investment in the textile sector.|
|**Merchanting trade**|**Merchanting trade** involves the shipment of goods **from one foreign country to another foreign country** without touching Indian ports, involving an Indian intermediary.<br><br>Merchanting trade of **restricted and prohibited items** under the export policy would now be possible.|It will help convert financial centres such as **GIFT city** etc. into major merchanting hubs as seen in places like Dubai, Singapore and Hong Kong.|
|**Amnesty Scheme**|Similar to the **“_Vivaad se Vishwaas_“** initiative, the government has introduced a **special one-time Amnesty Scheme** under which Exporters who have been unable to meet their obligations under EPCG and Advance Authorizations can be regularised on **payment of all customs duties exempted** in proportion to unfulfilled export obligations.<br><br>The interest payable is **capped at 100% of these exempted duties** under this scheme.|It will help in **reducing litigation and fostering trust-based relationships** to help alleviate the issues faced by exporters.|

**About the Previous Trade policy: The Foreign Trade Policy 2015-20**

It merged various schemes into a **single Merchandise Export from India Scheme (MEIS)** and simplified the **nomenclature of Export Houses**. The policy also introduced incentives for **Special Economic Zones and recognized successful business** leaders as **Status Holders**. A new chapter on **Quality Complaints and Trade Disputes** was incorporated to resolve trade disputes between exporters and importers. The mid-term review of the policy increased the scope **of MEIS and SEIS and extended the validity of Duty Credit Scrips**.

 **Context**: The parliamentary standing committee on heavy industry highlighted **that Phase 2 of the** [**FAME scheme**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/welfare-schemes/schemes-under-ministry-of-heavy-industries/fame-india-scheme/) **to subsidize electric vehicles has achieved only 51.96 per cent of its target**.

- In related news, the **Committee on Estimates (2022-23)** for the evaluation of electric vehicle policy under the **Union Ministry of Heavy Industries suggested an extension of the FAME II scheme.** 

**Issues highlighted in the committee report**

- **Massive dependence on oil imports and Internal Combustion Engine (ICE**) vehicles causes air **pollution and greenhouse gases**.
- **Slothy progress** in both physical and financial targets.
- **EV charging stations are sanctioned only for a few cities**.

**Suggestions**

- **Boost charging infrastructure**.
- The scheme should be extended further **with new targets, incentives, and measures**.
- Place greater **emphasis on implementation and extend the subsidy to private vehicles**.

**Lessons from China:**

- China’s experience **with promoting electric vehicles (EVs) by offering generous subsidies in 2009,** became costly for the government due **to the large price differential and a number of buyers**.
- So, it **phased out subsidies in 2020 and imposed a mandate on car manufacturers to ensure a certain percentage of all vehicles sold each year are battery-powered**.
- To avoid **financial penalties, manufacturers must earn a stipulated number of points based on range, energy efficiency, and performance.**
- An academic paper published recently suggested that the **phase-out policy is the most cost-effective approach to promote EV sales compared to other policies that provide larger subsidies over more extended periods.**

**About FAME Scheme:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Background**|FAME India is a part of the **National Electric Mobility Mission Plan**. The main thrust of FAME is to encourage electric vehicles by providing subsidies. The FAME India Scheme is aimed at incentivising all vehicle segments.|
|**Phases of the scheme**|**Phase I: started in 2015** and was completed on 31st March 2019. **Phase II: started from April 2019, and completed by 31st March 2022.**|
|**Technologies covered by the scheme**|**Hybrid & Electric technologies** like Mild Hybrid, Strong Hybrid, Plug-in Hybrid & Battery Electric Vehicles.|
|**Monitoring Authority**|**Department of Heavy Industries, the Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises.**|
|**Four focus areas of the scheme**|**Technology development, Demand Creation, Pilot Projects, Charging Infrastructure**.|
|**Objectives of the FAME Scheme**|Encourage **faster adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles by way of offering upfront Incentives on the purchase of Electric vehicles.**<br><br>Establish necessary charging **Infrastructure for electric vehicles.**|
|**Salient features of Phase II**|**Emphasis on electrification of public transportation, including shared transport, in the FAME India Scheme**.<br><br>Incentives are applicable mainly to **vehicles used for public transport or registered for commercial purpose**s.<br><br>The benefits of incentives will be extended to vehicles fitted with **advanced batteries like Lithium-Ion batteries.**|

**Source:** [**The Hindu**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/iit-mandis-novel-catalyst-offers-to-make-hydrogen-more-viable-as-fuel/article66674950.ece)

**Context**: Researchers at **IIT Mandi have developed a novel carbon-based catalyst** to **make water electrolysis more efficient.**

- Water electrolysis is the **process of choice to produce ‘green hydrogen** ‘thus making it more significant.

**About water electrolysis:**

- In water electrolysis, **water molecules are split into hydrogen and oxygen using electricity** inside a device called an **electrolyser**. However, this process **consumes a lot of electrical energy.**

**New finding:**

- A new study has **reported a porous carbon material containing nitrogen** that **functions both as a catalyst and as the anode in electrolyser units – and could substitute the metal-based catalysts.**
- The researchers produced this material, **called ‘laser carbon’, by exposing a sheet of a polymer called polyimide to a laser beam**, which carbonised the **exposed bits, leaving the remainder rich in nitrogen.**

**Advantages of the new catalyst:**

- Laser carbon is “**highly power efficient”, cheaper to produce, has a simpler synthesis technique, and “can be batch-manufactured with a laser”.**

### [How Plants Communicate](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/01/how-plants-communicate/)

#### **Facts For Prelims**

**Source: Indian Express**

**Context**: A team led by experts at Tel Aviv University has shown **tomato and tobacco plants, among others, not only make sounds but do so loudly enough for other creatures to hear.**

- Plants have **evolved complex biochemical responses and the ability to dynamically** alter their growth (and regrow body parts) in **response to environmental signals including light, gravity, temperature, touch, and volatile chemicals produced by surrounding organisms**.

**More about the research:**

- In 2019, researchers showed the **buzzing of bees can cause plants to produce sweeter nectar**. Others have shown white **noise played to Arabidopsis, a flowering plant in the mustard family, can trigger a drought response.**
- Researchers recorded airborne sounds produced by tomato and tobacco plants, and five other species (grapevine, henbit deadnettle, pincushion cactus, maize and wheat). These **sounds were ultrasonic, in the range of 20-100 kilohertz, and therefore can’t be detected by human ears.**

**What causes these sounds?**

- The team’s findings suggest that “**cavitation” may be at least partially responsible for the sounds**.
- Cavitation is the **process through which air bubbles expand and burst inside a plant’s water-conducting tissue, or “xylem”.**
