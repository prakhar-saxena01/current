### [Fall of Indus Valley Civilisation](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/28/fall-of-indus-valley-civilisation/)

#### **GS Paper 1**

 **Syllabus:** **Indian Culture – Salient Aspects of Art Forms, Literature and Architecture from Ancient to modern times**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/climate-change/harappa-rakhigarhi-dholavira-200-years-of-droughts-may-have-erased-these-indus-megacities-says-study-88990)

 **Context:** A recent study found that **severe droughts** during the Bronze Age may have wiped off the population of the Indus Valley people, endorsing the theory that climate change led to the collapse of ancient civilisation.

[**Indus Valley Civilisation**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/ancient-indian-history/harappan-indus-valley-civilization/) **(IVC):**

- It was a **Bronze Age civilisation** in the **northwestern regions** of South Asia, lasting from **3300 BCE to 1300 BCE**.
- It is also known as the **Harappan Civilisation**, after Harappa (now in Pakistan) – the **first of its sites** to be excavated early in the 20th century.
- It stretches over an area spanning northeast **Afghanistan**, much of **Pakistan** and western and northwestern **India**.
- It thrived in the **Indus River basins** and along a network of rivers that originally flowed near the ephemeral **Ghaggar-Hakra river** in northwest India and eastern Pakistan.
- The civilisation is noted for its **urban planning**, baked brick houses, elaborate drainage and water supply systems, handicraft techniques (carnelian products, seal carving) and metallurgy (copper, bronze, lead and tin).

**Important sites:**

**Decline: Climate change** → weaker monsoons → reduced water supply →  gradual drying of the soil →  scattering of population eastward and southward.

**Findings of the new study** (by the University of Cambridge)**:**

- **Droughts** that began 4,200 years ago gripped the civilisation and **went on for over two centuries.**
- The protracted droughts **severely affected food systems and habitation patterns** → forcing the people of the IVC to make **systemic changes to adapt** → a more self-reliant lifestyle.
- **They reorganised their large cities** and moved towards the east of the region in **smaller rural settlements**.
- They also had to make changes to their **agricultural practices** → relying more on drought-resilient crops such as millet.

**How did the study arrive at its conclusions?**

- The scientists studied the layers of a **stalagmite** – the vertical mass of mineral deposits rising from the floor of caves and caused by water dripping – to assess relative seasonal rainfall.
- They also used **high-precision Uranium-series dating** to assess the duration of the droughts.

**Other theories of the decline of the Indus Valley Civilization:**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Theory**|Theorist|Justification|
|**Aryan Invasion Theory**|Max Mueller, Mortimer Wheeler|Due to an invasion by the Aryan people, who came from the north and brought with them new technologies and ideas that led to the collapse of the existing civilization.|
|**Environmental Factors**|Robert Raikes, R.D. Oldham|This theory suggests that environmental factors, such as climate change, drought, and floods, played a major role in the decline of the Indus Valley Civilization.|
|**Internal Decline**|S.R. Rao|According to this theory, the decline of the Indus Valley Civilization was caused by internal factors such as **political instability, corruption, and economic decline**.|
|**Natural Disaster Theory**|D.P. Agrawal|This theory suggests that a **major natural disaster, such as an earthquake**, was responsible for the decline of the Indus Valley Civilization.|
|**Integration with Vedic Culture**|David Frawley|This theory suggests that the decline of the Indus Valley Civilization was not a collapse but rather a **transformation into the Vedic culture of ancien**t India.|

### [Veto Power at the UNSC](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/28/veto-power-at-the-unsc/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus****: Multilateral Organization**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/exercise-of-veto-in-unsc-driven-by-political-considerations-and-not-by-moral-obligations-india/article66784711.ece)

 **Context:** India has stated that the [**veto power in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC)**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/04/20/veto-power-of-unsc-permanent-members/) is driven by political considerations and not by moral obligations

**What is Veto Power?**

Veto power is a **special power given to the permanent members** of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), namely China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Essentially, it gives these countries the **ability to reject or veto any action by the UNSC** that does not align with their national interests or foreign policy objectives.

- In the United Nations Security Council, decisions are made **with a majority of 9 votes of the 15 Council members’ votes**. All decision is rejected if one of the five permanent members of the Security Council **makes use of its veto**

**The Need for Veto Power:**

- It prevents the UNSC **from making hasty or poorly thought-out decisions** that could have negative consequences.

- The UN veto has in some ways **saved the UN** as it gives **teeth to P5 nations**. The **League of Nations** failed because **it didn’t have the power** to implement its initiatives

- Veto power **gives the P5 members a sense of security** in knowing that their interests will not be overridden by the other members.

**Issues with the use of “Veto Power”:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Issue**|**Example**|
|**Veto immobilizes the ability of the UNSC to act**|Recently, **Russia has vetoed several resolutions** that would have put sanctions on it for **violating Ukraine’s sovereignty**, independence, unity, and territorial integrity.|
|**“Sovereign equality” is violated**|The fact that only five countries have veto powers goes against the idea of sovereign equality of states, perpetuating a Second World War mindset of **“to the victor belong the spoils”.**|
|**Political considerations over moral obligations**|The US has used its veto **power over 80 times**, often for political considerations, rather than moral obligations. For example, in 1972, the **US vetoed a resolution that called for an end to its bombing of North Vietnam**, despite widespread condemnation and protests.|
|**Veto has rendered the UNSC passive to certain pressing issues**|The UNSC stayed silent during major international conflicts, including the 2003 Iraq War, the 2008 conflict in Georgia, and the 2009 deaths of Sri Lankan Tamils.|
|**Lack of accountability**|In 2017, Russia vetoed a resolution that would have **condemned the use of chemical weapons in Syria**, despite substantial evidence of their use by the Syrian government.|
|**Critics opine the veto power is anachronistic, unjust, or counterproductive**|The veto power is seen as a disproportionate power and an impediment to credible international action in crises.|

**Suggestion for reforming the Veto system:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Reforms for Veto Power**|**Description**|
|**Abolish the veto power**|This would require an **amendment to the UN Charter**, which would need approval from **two-thirds of the General Assembly** and ratification by member states.|
|**Limit the use of the veto power**|. For example, a veto could be prohibited in **cases of genocide or crimes against humanity.**|
|[**Expand the permanent membership**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/international-relations/important-international-institutions-agencies-and-further-structure-mandate-etc/un/unsc-indias-run-for-permanent-membership-in-unsc/#:~:text=The%20UN%20defines%20'veto'%20as,of%20the%20UN%20Security%20Council.)|This could help **make the Council more representative** of the current global balance of power and would also **reduce the concentration of veto** power among a small group of states.|
|**Create longer-term non-permanent seats**|This will allow for **greater continuity and consistency** in the Council’s decision-making.|
|**Increase transparency and accountability**|This could be done by requiring permanent members to **publicly justify their use of the veto.**|

**Other aspects of the UN where India wants reforms are:**

- Categories of Membership
- The relationship between the Security Council and the General Assembly
- Regional representation
- The size of an enlarged Council
- Working Methods of the Council

**Conclusion:** 

It’s important for **P5 and other UN members to balance the Veto Issue** and make the Council more **representative and democratically accountable**, based on earlier experiences with the League of Nations.

**About UN Charter:**

The UN Charter is the **foundational treaty of the United Nations, signed in 1945** and in force since the same year. Its main objective is to **maintain international peace and security**, **promote social progress and better standards of life**, strengthen international law, and promote human rights. **All members of the UN** are bound by its articles

### [The Future of Nuclear Power in India](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/28/the-future-of-nuclear-power-in-india/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Indigenization of Technology and Developing New Technology/Energy**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/should-india-consider-phasing-out-nuclear-power/article66785072.ece)

**Context:** There are doubts about whether nuclear power, with its associated concerns about cost and safety, remains a viable choice for India as solar and wind power gain popularity globally.

**Global outlook for nuclear power:**

- **In Europe and the U.S.**, nuclear power is seeing an **upsurge**, particularly after the Ukraine war.
- **The U.K.** is scaling up nuclear power to **decarbonise the electricity**
- **Germany** has shut down the last of its nuclear power plants, while **France** (the nuclear powerhouse of the world) is struggling to replace its ageing reactors.
- **China and South Korea** have committed to increasing the share of nuclear power in the country’s energy mix (to 30% by 2030 in S. Korea).
- **Japan** is restarting the shutdown of reactors after the Fukushima (accident) because it was otherwise dependent either on expensive imported coal/natural gas (LNG).

**Advantages of nuclear power:**

- It is a **low-carbon power.**
    - A nuclear plant operating 1,000 MW at 90% PLF (plant load factor) **requires only 25 tonnes of low-enriched** (below 5% proportion of fissile uranium) uranium fuel per year.
    - A coal plant (of similar capacity) requires **~5 million tonnes of coal** and coal produces **ash** containing many heavy metals detrimental to the water source.
- **Firm and dispatchable power**. **Firm power** is the power that can be sent to the electric grid to be supplied whenever needed.
- Low operating cost, job-intensive.

**Disadvantages:** High capital cost, low safety/prone to accidents, concerns over nuclear proliferation, not renewable energy, radioactive waste generation, etc.

**India’s nuclear plan:**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/nuclear.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/nuclear.png)

- Nuclear power is **only 2.5%-3.2% of India’s installed and generated power** and is premised on working around its limited supply of enriched uranium.
- This is expected to increase to **22.5 GW by 2031 from 6.9 GW now.**

**Why** [**does India need more nuclear power**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/science-technology/nuclear-technology/nuclear-energy-in-india/)**?**

- **Very limited growth potential for hydropower** because of conserving biodiversity, the costs of rehabilitating and compensating landowners and the **seismological factors in the Himalayas**.
- **India has nearly 210 gigawatts of coal capacity**, producing 73% of the electricity of India, which is **not environmentally friendly**.
- Wind and solar powers are intermittent or variable.

**Way ahead for India:**

- The nuclear industry should move towards **‘passive safety’ designs** (for nuclear reactors). **For example**, active cooling pumps.
- **New designs like small modular reactors** will address the cost issue.
- **Enforcing nuclear liability**, for example, the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act 2010.
- **Ending the monopoly** of the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) in reactor operations. **Allow other government companies** like the NTPC.

**Conclusion:**

- If India hopes to achieve **‘**[**net zero’ by 2070**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/08/27/india-needs-a-10-tn-investment-for-reaching-the-net-zero-emission-target-by-2070/), it needs ~100 GW of nuclear power by 2050.
- Therefore, India should never consider phasing out nuclear power, which is a low carbon, firm and reliable.
- **India needs a portfolio of technologies** to make nuclear power safe and cost-effective (capital cost) over time.

**Context:** India’s push towards [**digital public infrastructure**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/31/editorial-analysis-indias-dpis-catching-the-next-wave/) and the deployment of [the Internet of Things](https://www.insightsonindia.com/science-technology/communication-and-it-technology/iot-internet-of-things/) in **development projects** offers significant possibilities for deploying [Web 3](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/11/blockchain-project-to-explore-the-potential-of-web3/).

**What is World Wide Web?** 

It is a **collection of websites or web pages** stored in web servers and connected to local computers through the internet.

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/web_3.0.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/web_3.0.png)

**What is Digital public infrastructure (DPI)?**

It refers to the **technology and digital systems** that are **publicly owned or publicly provided** to enable the delivery of public services, facilitate access to information, and promote digital inclusion. E.g., the Aadhaar system, BharatNet project, and Unified Payments Interface (UPI) system.

**How India can benefit from the third-generation web:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Area of Benefit**|**Example**|
|**Intellectual Property Rights Protection**|Digital tokens **minted by Web 3** platforms can enable India’s handicraft industry to secure their innovations|
|**Rapid Dissemination of Grassroots Innovations**|Web 3-based instruction tools can **enable master artisans to share their innovations with fellow members,** improving the economic fortunes of craftsmen and artisan communities in north-east, western and peninsular India|
|**Deployment in Rural Areas**|Web 3.0 can be used to provide data **analytics and insights in rural development projects MGNREGA,** mapping the water use habits of communities, and **improving early warning systems** for floods|
|**Community Data Analytics**|Web 3.0 analytics systems can be used to analyze **community data generated by IoT-enabled development** programs like the Jal Jeevan Mission, providing valuable insights|
|**Tokenization for Development Programs**|**India’s National Blockchain Strategy 2021 proposes** to explore tokenization and apply blockchain solutions for development programs, making Web 3.0 a useful tool for achieving this goal|
|**Creation of distributed economic system**|**Native digital tokens, Central Bank Digital Currency and cryptocurrencies** would be used for monetary circulation, making the transaction **fast, traceable and effortless.**|
|**Creation of an ownership economy**|**Web3’s non-custodial wallets** function as **digital passports** for users to access blockchain-enabled transaction platforms. Using these, **creators themselves control their content**. Fundamentally, they work as **digital proof of identity**.|

**Challenges in the deployment of Web 3.0:**

- Limited awareness and understanding of the technology
- Inadequate infrastructure
- A lack of technical expertise
- Absence of clear regulations and policies for Web 3.0 implementation

In the ongoing case of the [same-sex relationship as a marriage](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/20/what-is-indias-stand-on-same-sex-marriage/), Supreme Court has said that British Victorian morality stifled the **ancient all-inclusive culture of India**, which accepted same-sex love. The court corrected the government’s perspective and said that the **impact of British Victorian morality made India forsake much of its cultural ethos**.

**British Victorian morality** refers to a set of **social and moral values** that were prevalent in Britain during the Victorian era (1837 to 1901). These values were characterized by a strict code of conduct that emphasized **sexual repression, traditional gender roles, and conservative social norms**.

**Usage**: The terms can be used to show the **negative impact of the continuation** of the colonial legacy in India’s social and governance system.

### [Nuclear Liability](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/28/nuclear-liability/)

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nuclear-liability-issues-not-yet-resolved-for-jaitapur-project-french-company-edf/article66774668.ece)

 **Context:** Talks between Indian and French officials over several issues, including liability, for the **construction of six nuclear power reactors in Maharashtra’s Jaitapur**, have not resulted in any breakthrough.

**Issues concerned:**

- **India’s Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act** (CLNDA)
- **The high cost of power per unit**
- **Opposition from activists and locals** for the fear of environmental damage and health hazards
- **Safety concerns:** Concerns over the **safety of nuclear power** have prompted Germany to switch off its last nuclear power reactor.

**What is** [**nuclear liability**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/science-technology/nuclear-technology/civil-nuclear-liability-act/)**?**

Nuclear liability refers to the legal responsibility for damages and compensation in case of a nuclear accident or incident. It involves determining who is responsible for the damages caused and who will pay for the compensation of those affected.

**What is CLNDA?**

It is an Indian law enacted in 2010 to provide a **civil liability regime for nuclear damage** in India. Key provisions of the Act:

- It provides for **strict and no-fault liability on the operator**, where it will be held liable for damage regardless of any fault on its part.
- Concept of **supplier of equipment’s liability** over and above that of the operator’s
- It specifies the **liability of nuclear operators**
- The compensation payable in the event of a nuclear incident
- The process for **claiming compensation**
- Establishes the **Nuclear Damage Claims Commission** to adjudicate claims for compensation
- **Establishes the Nuclear Liability Fund** to provide financial support in the event of a nuclear incident.

**About Jaitapur nuclear power project (signed in 2010):**

 It is a proposed **9,900 MW nuclear power plant in Maharashtra**, India. It is planned to be constructed by the **French energy company Electricite de France (EDF)**, using **six** **European pressurised reactors** (EPRs). It is the **world’s biggest nuclear power generation** site under consideration at present

**About Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage (CSC) (adopted 1997):**

It seeks to establish a **uniform global legal regime** for compensation to victims in the unlikely event of a nuclear accident. India is a party to it. It is based on the exclusive liability of the **operator of a nuclear installation and no other person (but Indian law provides for the Supplier’s liability as well)**

### [Use of Hydrogen in the steelmaking](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/28/use-of-hydrogen-in-the-steelmaking/)

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/hydrogen-direct-reduction-water-pore-formation-mystery/article66781330.ece)

 **Context:** A recent study by German researchers suggests that **hydrogen could be used for steelmaking instead of Carbon**.

**What is steel?**

Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon with improved strength and fracture resistance compared to other forms of iron. Strong steel consists of a tiny amount – **less than 1%** – of carbon.

**Issues with the current method of steelmaking:**

The current method of steelmaking— the blast furnace/basic oxygen furnace route, and the electric arc furnace route—contributes to **5-7%** of global emissions. Making one tonne of steel releases **1.8 tonnes of carbon dioxide**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Traditional Steelmaking Process**|[**New Steelmaking Process**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/14/green-steel/) **Using Hydrogen**|
|Iron oxide is **heated with coke** (coal with high carbon content) at 1,700°C inside a blast furnace.|Iron oxide is **reacted with hydrogen** in a direct reduction reactor.|
|Carbon reacts with oxygen to form carbon dioxide, **leaving iron with around 4% carbon behind.**|Hydrogen reacts with oxygen in iron oxide, producing **water vapour as a byproduct**.|
|Iron is remelted and oxygen is blown through it, producing **more carbon dioxide and reducing the amount of carbon** in the iron to a desirable level.|Creating a “**microfracture structure” on the iron oxide feedstock** to encourage the creation of channels that drain trapped water and allow hydrogen to replace it in the reaction.|

**Thus, the new process releases significantly less Green House gas.**

**India’s status:**

India is the **world’s second-largest steelmaker**, having produced **118.2 million** tonnes in 2021.

### [Eco-Sensitive Zones](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/28/eco-sensitive-zones-2/)

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/supreme-court-modifies-order-on-eco-sensitive-zones-around-protected-forests/article66782430.ece)

 **Context:** The Supreme Court of India has modified its earlier judgment that mandated a **minimum one-kilometre** [**eco-sensitive zone**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/06/04/what-are-the-eco-sensitive-zones-eszs/) around protected forests, national parks, and wildlife sanctuaries across the country.

**Changed Order:**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Aspect**|**Previous 2022 Order**|**Changed Order**|
|**Minimum ESZ distance**|1 km|ESZ **cannot be uniform across the country** and has to be “**protected area-specific”.**|
|**Applicability of order**|**Applied universally** to all protected areas|Not applicable to ESZs for which draft and final notifications have been issued by MoEF&CC and in respect of proposals.|
|**Mining allowed**|Not specified, but implied to be allowed within ESZ|**No mining is allowed,** either within national parks and sanctuaries or in a 1 km radius.|
|**Development activities**|Not specified, but subject to restrictions|Any developmental activities undertaken within ESZs should follow the **MoEF&CC 2011 guidelines and** provisions of the **2022 Office Memorandum by MoEF&CC**|
|**Exception**|Not specified|Where national parks and sanctuaries are located on **inter-state borders or share common boundaries.**|

**Why SC changed its 2022 order?**

- The earlier order had [affected **hundreds of villages**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/19/why-has-the-creation-of-eco-sensitive-zones-provoked-protests/) **in the peripheries of forests**,
- The stringent observance of the judgment would **hamper the development of basic infrastructure** like schools, dispensaries, and roads, and affect eco-development activities around national parks and sanctuaries.
- The order would also impact **certain projects of national and strategic importance** such as the construction of national highways, railways, defence-related infrastructure, etc.

**About Eco-sensitive zone:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
||**Definition**|
|**Eco-sensitive zone (ESZ)**|An area around a protected area like a national park or wildlife sanctuary|
|**Purpose**|To conserve the biodiversity and ecosystems of protected areas by regulating human activities|
|**Regulations**|The **government can regulate and restrict certain** activities in ESZs through guidelines and laws|
|**Activities**|Activities that can be regulated include mining, construction, and tourism|
|**Size**|As per **National Wildlife Action Plan (2002-2016),** land within **10 km** of the boundaries of national parks and wildlife sanctuaries is to be notified as ESZ. However, its size can vary depending on the location and specific needs of the protected area|
|**Notification**|ESZs are designated by the **Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEF&CC)** (under the **Environment Protection Act, 1986)**|
|**Importance**|ESZs are crucial for maintaining the **ecological balance, and integrity and protecting** the wildlife of India|
