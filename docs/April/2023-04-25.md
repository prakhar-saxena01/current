### [Rule of Law](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/25/rule-of-law/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus****: Governance**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/rule-of-law-index-india-rank-uttar-pradesh-8572425/)

 **Context:** Given the recent incidents in Uttar Pradesh, this article tries to understand the concept of **‘Rule of Law’**.

**What is the Rule of Law?**

 It states that ‘**the Law is supreme and no human being has authority over it’**. In India, the Rule of Law is **guaranteed** by the **Constitution (Article 14)**, which means that all authorities must strictly adhere to it.

**Three principles of RoL as defined by A.V. Dicey:**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Principle**|**Description**|**Example**|
|**Supremacy of Law**|All individuals, including government officials, are subject to the law and no one is above the law.|If a leader (even President or Prime Minister) is found guilty of corruption, they can be prosecuted and punished according to the law, just like any other citizen.|
|**Equality Before the Law**|All individuals are equal under the law and are entitled to the same legal rights and protections, regardless of their social status or wealth.|An example of this principle is the **requirement for a fair trial**, where every accused person is entitled to the same legal rights, such as the right to legal representation, the right to remain silent, and the right to a speedy trial.|
|**Individual Rights**|The Rule of Law protects individual rights and freedoms, including property rights, freedom of speech, and personal liberty.|The Constitution guarantees fundamental rights, such as the right to freedom of expression, the right to own property, etc.|

**What are the exceptions to the Rule of Law?**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Principle**|**Description**|
|**Non-answerability**|The President/Governor is not answerable to any court for the exercise of their powers and duties.|
|**Immunity from Criminal Proceedings**|No criminal case can be initiated against the President/Governor during their tenure.|
|**Notice Period for Civil Proceedings**|A two-month notice period must be served before initiating a civil proceeding against the President/Governor.|

**Rule of Law Vs Rule by Law:**

 **“Rule of Law”** ensures that the **law applies equally to everyone**, including the government, while **“Rule by Law”** uses the law **as a tool of oppression and allows** the government to create laws that may not be just or fair.

**Role of Indian Judiciary in Establishing Rule of Law in India:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Role of Judiciary**|**Example**|
|**Assumption of Rule of Law**|**Bachhan Singh v. State of Punjab states that the Rule of Law** is based on three fundamental assumptions: Legislation should be made by a democratically elected legislature, legislative power should be limited, and an independent judiciary is required to protect citizens from abuses of executive and legislative power.|
|**Protection of Fundamental Rights**|E.g., in Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973), the Supreme Court held that the **Constitution of India has a basic structure** which cannot be amended by the Parliament.|
|[**Judicial Review**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/structure-organization-and-functioning-of-the/judiciary/judicial-review/#:~:text=Judicial%20review%20is%20the%20power,challenged%20by%20the%20affected%20person.)|**Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (1978)** established that before a person’s life and liberty are taken away, the law must be valid, there must be a just, reasonable, and fair procedure in the law, and the law must meet the requirements of **Articles 14 and 19** of the Constitution.|
|**Interpretation of Laws**|**In Vishakha v. State of Rajasthan (1997),** the Supreme Court laid down guidelines for [preventing sexual harassment in the workplace](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Preventing-Sexual-Harassment-at-Workplace.pdf) until the Parliament enacts a law on the subject.|

**About** [**Rule of Law Index**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/06/20/rule-of-law-index/)**:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
||**Information**|
|**As per the Rule of Law Index 2022, India has been ranked 77 out of 140 countries (2019 ranking (68 out of 126 countries))**|   |
|**Released by**|World Justice Project (WJP)|
|**Factors considered**|Constraints on government powers, absence of corruption, open government, fundamental rights, order and security, regulatory enforcement, civil justice, and criminal justice|
|**India’s global rank**|94 in adherence to fundamental rights, 111 in civil justice, 89 in criminal justice, 93 in absence of corruption|
|**Neighbouring countries**|Bangladesh (127), Pakistan (129), China (95), Nepal (69)|
|**Ranking of Uttar Pradesh**|The WJP Index doesn’t provide sub-national ranks, but [the **India Justice Report 2022**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/05/india-justice-report-2022/) **ranks Uttar Pradesh (UP)** as the **worst-performing state** among the 18 large and mid-sized states of India|

**Why Rule of law matters?**

Research (including those done by the World Bank) has shown that **stricter adherence to it is positively correlated to**:

- Higher economic growth
- Better educational attainment
- Improved health outcomes
- Greater peace and stability

**Conclusion:**

The Rule of Law is now the accepted norm of all civilized societies, and everywhere it is identified with the liberty of the individual. Countries must promote it for the socio-economic as well as the overall well-being of its citizens.

### [Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/25/markets-in-crypto-assets-mica/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus:** **Indian economy and related issues**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/explained-what-is-the-eus-new-crypto-legislation/article66771289.ece#:~:text=The%20regulation%20prescribes%20different%20sets,services%20across%20the%2027%20countries.)

 **Context:** The European Parliament has approved the world’s first set of comprehensive rules – MiCA – to bring largely unregulated [cryptocurrency](https://www.insightsonindia.com/science-technology/communication-and-it-technology/cryptocurrency/) markets under the ambit of government authorities.

**The Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) legislation:**

**Need:**

- **22% of the global crypto industry** was concentrated in Europe, which received $1.3 trillion worth of crypto assets.
- **2022 saw bankruptcies and fraud scandals** in the crypto industry (collapse of the crypto exchange FTX, etc).

**The new rules:**

- **MiCA will impose compliance on the issuers of crypto assets** (legal person who offers to the public any type of crypto-assets).
- It will apply to **crypto-asset service providers** (CASPs) providing services like the custody, administration, and exchange of crypto assets.
    - **A CASP can get authorised in any one member country** and will be allowed to conduct their services across the 27 countries.
- **It requires crypto companies to send information** about senders and recipients of crypto assets to their local anti-money laundering authority**.**

**What kind of assets will MiCA cover?**

- It will apply to **‘crypto assets’**, including not only traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum but also to newer ones like **stablecoins**.
    - **Stablecoins are digital tokens** that aim to stay pegged in value with a more stable asset like the U.S. dollar or other stable cryptocurrencies.
- **The MiCA’s scope will exclude** central bank digital currencies, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and other crypto assets already under existing regulation.

**Significance:**

- **A comprehensive framework** for 27 countries in Europe **not only harmonises** the crypto industry but also gives the EU **a competitive edge in its growth.**
- **It will protect consumers** against deception and fraud.
- Information sharing provisions will **prevent laundering and terror financing activities.**

**What has been the reaction?**

- The new rules will come into force after formal approval by (27) member states.
- A broader view is that **it is better to have a regulatory framework than to have no rules at all.**
- However, **the rule is already behind in terms of addressing more recent weaknesses** (as it is under development for 3 years) in the cryptocurrency market.
    - **For instance**, it does not cover practices like **crypto staking and lending.**

**How is crypto regulated in India?**

- **India is yet to have a comprehensive regulatory framework** for crypto assets and the legality of cryptocurrencies in the country is still a grey area.
- However, the Indian government has taken certain steps to bring cryptocurrencies under the **ambit of specific authorities and taxation**. **For example,**
    - In the Union Budget 2022, the Finance Ministry imposed a **30% tax** on income from the “**transfer of any virtual digital asset**.”
    - The government placed all transactions involving virtual digital assets under the purview of the **Prevention of Money Laundering Act** (PMLA).
- **India is now calling for consensus in the G20 grouping**, to have a globally coordinated policy response on crypto assets.

### [Farmer producer companies (FPC)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/25/farmer-producer-companies-fpc/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus:** **Agriculture and related issues**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/governance/heavy-sway-big-corporations-with-power-over-farmer-producer-companies-is-diluting-their-purpose-88864)

 **Context:** ITC Limited has helped form 78 farmer-producer companies (FPC) between November 2022 and February 2023.

**FPC:**

- It is a **hybrid** between cooperative societies and private limited companies, registered under the **Companies Act 2013**, **owned and operated by farmers.**
- It is a type of [**farmer producer organisation**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/agriculture/agricultural-marketing-and-issues/contract-farming/issues-and-shortcomings-with-current-agricultural-marketing-process/) (FPO) that –
    - Deals in aggregated produce of a large number of member-owner farmers,
    - Helping them achieve economies of scale,
    - Increase their **farm-level efficiency as well as the ability to negotiate prices** in the market.
- **Creating an FPC is a long-drawn process** (usually it takes months to start an FPC), involving mobilisation and training of farmers to run a company.

**How did ITC achieve the feat?**

- By reaching out to farmers already registered on its **e-Choupal** website for selling produce.
- ITC acted as a **Cluster-Based Business Organisation (CBBO).**

**How CBBO helped in the formation of FPCs?**

- **CBBO is a concept introduced in the Union Budget 2019-20** under Formation and Promotion of 10,000 FPOs – **a Central scheme** to provide hand-holding to FPCs and to create 10,000 FPOs by 2024.
- Any legal entity registered in India can be a CBBO, and **receives Rs 25 lakh** over a period of five years for every FPC it **helps create or run.**
- With the announcement of CBBOs, the formation of **FPCs has seen a huge rise** (5,000 in 2018 to over 16,000 in 2023 as per the Union Ministry of Corporate Affairs).

**This increase has come at a cost:**

- **Most big organisations** (have no local stakes.) are able to qualify for the role of a CBBO.
    - This is because of the flawed criteria – such an organisation needs to meet **a minimum annual turnover of Rs 2/1 crore in the plains**/**hilly**
    - **FPCs lack the bargaining power** against big companies.
- **FPCs are often unable to act independently in decision-making or be farmer-centric.**
    - **For example**, ITC’s FPCs are likely to sell their produce, even if they are offered a higher price elsewhere → squeezing the margin of FPCs.
- **FPCs were organised just to meet the target** and there was no owner-member involvement in their functioning.
- **Financing woes:** Just 1-5% of FPCs have received funds under Central schemes introduced to promote them in the last seven years.
- **Less survival prospects:** 79% of the FPCs registered in 2020-2021 had a paid-up capital of Rs 1 lakh or less, which is far too little to survive in the long run.

**Steps taken by the govt:**

- The government has introduced two schemes to fund FPOs – **Equity Grant Scheme and Credit Guarantee Scheme**.
- Under the Equity Grant Scheme, **Small Farmers’ Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC) offers equity grants** up to a maximum of Rs 15 lakh within a period of three years.
- The Credit Guarantee Scheme **provides risk cover to banks** that advance collateral-free loans up to Rs 1 crore.

**Way ahead:**

- **CBBOs should train FPC members**, the CEO and the board of directors and impart business knowledge.
- **For an FPC to succeed it should**
    - **Be designed according to local**, community-owned food system perspective (as opposed to commodity orientation),
    - Provide free ecosystem services (for example, soil formation, pollination, predation) and
    - Be independent of corporations for the procurement of seeds and synthetic inputs.
- [**Civil society organisations**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/19/indias-civil-society-organisations/) which are community-based, must be given priority to form FPCs.

### [Reducing urea Consumption in India](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/25/reducing-urea-consumption-in-india/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Issues related to Direct and Indirect Farm Subsidies**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/why-urea-rules-indias-farms-8573907/)

 **Context:** None of the government measures has succeeded in reducing urea consumption in India.

**Background:**

- In 2015, the Centre made it **mandatory to coat all indigenously manufactured and imported urea with neem oil**.
- This was followed by **replacing 50-kg bags with 45 kg ones** in 2018, and the launch of the liquid ‘**Nano Urea**’ by the Indian Farmers’ Fertiliser Cooperative (IFFCO) in 2021.
- The above measures aimed at **checking illegal diversion for non-agricultural use, and increasing nitrogen use efficiency**, have failed in reducing urea consumption.

**Sales of urea in India:**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/yield.jpg?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/yield.jpg)

- After neem-coating was fully implemented, consumption did decline for the first two years, but that trend reversed from 2018-19.

**NBS:**

- **Fertilisers are essentially food for crops**, which need nutrients (for plant growth and grain yield) –
    - Primary (N, P, K),
    - Secondary (S, calcium, magnesium) and
    - Micro (iron, zinc, copper, manganese, boron, molybdenum).
- With this in mind, the **nutrient-based subsidy (NBS) regime** was launched in India in 2010.
- Under NBS, **the government fixed a per-kg subsidy for each fertiliser nutrient:** Nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potash (K) and sulphur (S).

**Purpose of NBS:**

- This (unlike the earlier product-specific subsidy regime) was **intended to promote balanced fertilisation by discouraging farmers from applying too much** –
    - Urea,
    - Di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) and
    - Muriate of potash (MOP).
    - These are fertilisers with high content of a single nutrient: **Urea (46% N), DAP (46% P plus 18% N) and MOP (60% K).**
- It was expected to **induce product innovation**, besides more use of complex fertilisers (having lower concentrations of N, P, K and S in different proportions) and single super phosphate – SSP (containing only 16% P but also 11% S).

**Failure of NBS: Worsening of nutrient imbalance**, with urea consumption rising by over a third since 2009-10.

**Reasons behind rising urea and DAP consumption:**

- **Its maximum retail price (MRP)** went up by a mere 16.5% from Rs 4,830 to Rs 5,628 per tonne post the introduction of NBS.
    - **The current per-tonne MRP** – Rs 5,628 for urea, Rs 27,000 for DAP and Rs 34,000 for MOP – are nowhere compatible with a 4:2:1 NPK use ratio generally considered ideal for Indian soils.
- **Price controls on DAP**, with companies not allowed to charge more than Rs 27,000 per tonne.

**The cost of disproportionate application of N by farmers:**

- During the Green Revolution, higher doses of fertiliser application produce more grain.
- Over time, **crop yield response to fertiliser use has more than halved**: 1 kg of NPK nutrients yielded 12.1 kg of cereal grains during the 1960s, and 5 kg during the 2010s.
- **The decline in nitrogen use efficiency** (NUE has fallen from 48.2% in 1962-63 to 34.7% in 2018**)**, which refers to the proportion of N applied mainly through urea that is actually utilised by crops to produce harvested yields.

**The solutions:**

- **Reduce the consumption of N** and promote products containing other nutrients in desired (crop- and soil-specific) combinations.
    - The government should make the **incorporation of urease and nitrification inhibitors** (a chemical that makes more N available to the crops) compulsory in urea.
- **There are two approaches to cutting urea consumption –** raising prices and improving NUE.
    - **Nano Urea** is primarily aimed at boosting NUE.
    - The ultra-small size of its particles (20-50 nanometers) **is said to allow easier penetration through the stomatal pores of leaves**.
    - If the government wants to promote Nano Urea (for foliar application directly to the leaves), **it may have to subsidise the cost of spraying.**

**Trees with high Air Pollution Tolerance Index (APTI)** (a tool used to assess the tolerance capacity of tree and crop species against air pollution) value are pipal, neem, mango and crops like maise, pigeon pea and safflower.

**Ascorbic acid (vitamin C)** is involved in regulating photosynthesis, hormone biosynthesis, and regenerating other antioxidants.

**Usage**: The example of these native trees can be cited for greening Urban airspace to curb air pollution.

 **Context:** A new study by the **Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA)** has found that countries that imposed crude oil sanctions on Russia used India, China, United Arab Emirates, Singapore and Turkey **as ‘laundromats’ for** refined products.

**Key points:**

- During the last year, India has emerged as the **leading exporter of refined oil products, followed by China and the United Arab Emirates**.
- **Major exporting port:**
    - **Sikka port in Gujarat** (owned by Reliance; handles import and export of petroleum from Jamnagar refinery) exported the **highest amount of seaborne refined oil** to the Price Cap Coalition countries
    - **Vadinar port** (also in Gujarat; owned by Nayara Energy Limited, of which Russian oil company Rosneft holds around 50% share)
- India now imports about **87% of its crude oil requirement** (worth over US $190 bn) while it exported petroleum products worth over **$86 billion** (accounting for more than **21 per cent of India’s total commodity exports**)

**What is Laundromat?**

‘Laundromats’ is a term used to describe **a type of financial fraud where large amounts of money, often obtained through illegal means**, are moved through a complex web of transactions and accounts to disguise their origin and make them appear legitimate.
