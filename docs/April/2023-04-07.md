### [Pre-draft of National Curriculum Framework for Schools](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/07/pre-draft-of-national-curriculum-framework-for-schools/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Issues Relating to the Development and Management of Social Sector/Services relating to Education, Human Resources**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/education/government-releases-pre-draft-of-national-curriculum-framework-for-schools/article66707766.ece#:~:text=The%20Ministry%20of%20Education%20released,%2C%20experts%2C%20scholars%20and%20professionals.)

 **Context:** The Ministry of Education (MoE) released a pre-draft version of the National Curriculum Framework (NCF) for School Education and has sought feedback from various stakeholders.

**Background:**

- As School education is the foundation stone of a child’s life, the [National Education Policy 2020](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/07/30/new-education-policy/) recommends –
    - Shift from 10+2 structure to **5+3+3+4**,
    - Developmental perspectives suggest **curricular and pedagogical shifts** at **foundational, preparatory (grade III, IV & V), middle and secondary stages**.

**As a follow-up of the NEP 2020**, the development of **four NCFs** has been initiated:

- **NCF for Foundational Stage (**had been brought out and launched in 2022)
- NCF for School Education
- NCF for Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE)
- NCF for Teacher Education and NCF for Adult Education.

The National Steering Committee under **Dr. K. Kasturirangan** was set up by the MoE to undertake and guide the development of NCFs.

**The NCF for School Education – Pre-Draft:**

- It covers the framework of curriculum for **age groups 3 to 18 years** and a key part of the document is the inclusion of **values and their “rootedness” in India**, in
    - Content and learning of languages,
    - Pedagogical approaches including tools and resources, etc

- It leans towards making students **acquainted with true sources of knowledge** – a philosophical preoccupation of ancient Indians. These sources focus on **six pramanas:**

**Focuses on the moral development of a child:** This will be through **Pancha kosha Vikas or five-fold development –**

- annamaya kosha (physical layer),
- pranamaya kosha (life force energy layer),
- manomaya kosha (mind layer),
- vijnanamaya kosha (intellectual layer) and
- anandamaya kosha (inner self).

**Courses at Grade 10 and above:**

- Grade 10 students will have to take two essential courses from

- **In Grades 11 and 12**, students will be offered choice-based courses in the same disciplines for more rigorous engagement.

**Modular Board Exams for Class 11 and 12:**

- This will be offered as **opposed to a single exam** at the end of the year and the final result will be based on the cumulative result of each exam.
- Currently, the **life-determining board examinations are available only on two occasions** (grade 10 and 12), which prevents truly holistic development of students.

**It suggested 3 approaches to assessments:** Assessment –

- ‘**of learning**‘ (measurement of achievement of student learning),
- ‘**for learning**‘ (evidence of student learning gathered by the teacher that provides inputs to guide the teaching-learning processes) and
- ‘**as learning**‘ (when assessments are introduced as non-threatening tools for self-reflection and introspection).

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Government Policies and Interventions for Development in various sectors and Issues arising out of their Design and Implementation**

**Source:** [**PIB**](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1914358)

**Context:** The MeitY notified amendments to the IT Rules 2021 related to [online gaming](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/25/online-gaming-a-changing-scenario-on-the-cards/).

**What are the Amendments?**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Amendments**|**Explanation**|
|**Fixing responsibilities of intermediaries**|**It is obligatory on the part of intermediaries –**<br><br>●       To make a reasonable effort **to not host/publish/share any online game that**<br><br>○       **Can harm the user harm**<br><br>○       **Has not been verified** by an online gaming self-regulatory body.<br><br>●       To ensure that no advertisement of a non-permissible online game is hosted on its platform.<br><br>●       In relation to **online games involving real money**, their responsibilities include<br><br>○       The displaying of a mark of verification by the self-regulatory body;<br><br>○       Informing their users of the policy for withdrawal or refund of the deposit, etc;<br><br>○       Obtaining the KYC details of the users; and<br><br>○       Not giving credit or enabling financing by third parties to the users.<br><br>●       To not publish, share or host fake, false or misleading information (**will be identified by the notified Fact Check Unit of the Central Govt**) in respect of **any business of the Central Government**.|
|**Setting Role of Government**|May **notify multiple self-regulatory bodies**, which shall be representative of the online gaming industry but function at arm’s length from their members.|
|**Role/authority of the self-regulatory body**|●       To inquire and satisfy itself that the online game does not involve betting/gambling on any outcome.<br><br>●       To ensure that the online game complies with the rules/requirements under the law, including measures to safeguard through parental controls, etc.|
|**Applicability of rules**|The obligations become applicable once a sufficient number of self-regulatory bodies have been designated so that the online gaming industry has adequate time to comply.|

**Proposal on the fact-checking unit:**

- Earlier the Ministry had proposed that news identified as “fake” by the [fact-checking unit of the PIB](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/18/fake-news-news-marked-false-by-pib-to-be-taken-down/) will not be allowed on online intermediaries.
    - However, **the final draft has removed the reference to PIB.**
- The social media platforms have sent a proposal to the Centre to create a network of fact-checkers **– Misinformation Combat Alliance –** who will verify dubious content posted on their platforms.
- The alliance will act as a “**certification body**” that will verify who a “trusted” fact-checker is.

**The aim of these amendments:**

- To enforce **greater due diligence** by online gaming and social media intermediaries.
- To protect the safety and trust of the **Digital Nagriks** and **provide every opportunity possible to create startups and innovate.**
- Enable the Indian online gaming ecosystem to **expand and grow** and become an important catalyst to **India’s One trillion-dollar Digital economy goal** by 2025-26.

 **Context:** As [Stand-Up India](https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/welfare-schemes/schemes-under-ministry-of-finance/stand-up-india/) completes 7 years, the PM acknowledged the role that the initiative has played in **empowering** the SC/ST communities,  women and **job creation**.

**The Stand-up India scheme:**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/stand.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/stand.png)

- It **aims at promoting entrepreneurship** among women and scheduled castes and tribes.
- It was launched in **2016** and is anchored by the **Department of Financial Services** (DFS), Ministry of Finance, Government of India.
- It facilitates **bank loans between Rs 10 lakh and Rs 1 Crore** to at least one SC/ST borrower and at least one woman borrower per bank branch **for setting up a greenfield enterprise** (the first-time venture) **only**.
- This enterprise may be in **manufacturing, services or the trading sector**.
- **In the case of non-individual enterprises,** at least 51% of the shareholding and controlling stake should be held by either an SC/ST or a woman entrepreneur.

**The scheme can  be accessed in three potential ways:**

- Directly at the branch or,
- Through Stand-Up India Portal or,
- Through the Lead District Manager (LDM).

- **Hand-holding (pre and post-sanction of the loan):** Hand-holding of borrowers from the targeted community, CM helpline for query resolution (**Burhanpur**, MP), etc.
- **Effective coordination amongst implementing units:** It is essential that all agencies and persons involved, i.e. SIDBI, LDMs, and bank officials are on the same page.

**Way ahead:**

- Banks should be **incentivised** to motivate and reward officials and banks with large numbers of disbursements while offering due diligence.
- All the stakeholders of the program should be **educated** through IEC activities, **workshops and training**.
- **Build success stories** in all geographical regions for motivating the masses.

IAS officer R. Vineel Krishna, Special Secretary to Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, recently visited Swabhiman Anchal in Odisha’s Malkangiri district (once a bastion of left-wing extremists (LWEs)). This was Mr Krishna’s first visit to the region **after being abducted by armed cadres of the CPI (Maoist) in February 2011**.

The region was **“cut off” from three sides and was the centre of the CPI Maoist** activities. However, a slew of development projects such as:

- **Gurupriya Bridge**, ₹100 crores under the SETU scheme and,
- **Confidence-building measures** by officers like Vineel Krishna have now led to the region being completely sanitized from Maoist influences and integration of the people into the State’s administration.

**Values**: Commitment to public service, Responsibility and accountability, and Transformational leadership.

|---|---|
|**Perspective of Ram Rajya**|**Key Points**|
|**Gandhi’s perspective**|Ram Rajya means **equal rights for all**, including the weak and the meek. It meant equal rights to **“prince and pauper**”.|
|**Ambedkar’s perspective**|Ambedkar had a literal interpretation of Ram Rajya. He believed that Ram upheld the **Varnashrama** **system** and killed a Dalit saint, which made Ram Rajya unjust and patriarchal. Ambedkar was **critical of Ram’s treatment of Sita**|
|**Plato’s perspective**|Plato’s panacea was ‘philosopher kings’. According to Plato, **rule by a select class of wise men is better than a democracy** based on mass hysteria|
|**The common aspect of Gandhi’s and Ambedkar’s perspective**|Both Gandhi and Ambedkar argued from a logical perspective, not from blind faith or hatred. Both highlighted the fact that a **just system should be one where the weak are protected and their voices heard.**|

 **Context:** Finland became the **31st member of** [**NATO**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/02/17/north-atlantic-treaty-organization-3/). Also, Britain will become the **12th member to join** [**CPTPP**](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/04/cptpp-trade-tariff-brexit-uk/) **(**Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership) -the first to join the partnership since its inception.

**Reasons:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Finland**|**Britain**|
|Finland shares a **1,340km long border with Russia** and had signed a “friendship agreement,” with the Soviet Union to be a neutral country (Military non-alignment- ‘**Finlandisation’**). However, after Russia launched the invasion of Ukraine last year, Finland decided to join NATO.|Britain joined CPTPP to build ties around the world after leaving the European Union ([BREXIT](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/10/26/editorial-analysisbrexit-britains-challenges-remain/)).|

**About NATO**

### [ASBA: Trading in the secondary market](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/07/asba-trading-in-the-secondary-market/)

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [Indian Express](https://indianexpress.com/article/business/market/sebi-approves-asba-like-facility-for-trading-in-secondary-market-8526920/)

 **Context**: The **Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi)** approved a framework for an **Application Supported by a Blocked Amount (ASBA)** like facility being made available to **investors for secondary market trading.**

**About ASBA:**

**ASBA stands for Application Supported by Blocked Amount**. It is a facility that allows investors to apply for **initial public offerings (IPOs**) and invest in the stock market **without actually transferring the money to the IPO issuer or stockbroker upfront**. Instead, the investor’s application money is temporarily blocked in their bank account until the shares are allotted to them.

This helps investors **earn interest on their money while it is blocked** and also **eliminates the risk of fraud or misappropriation** of funds by intermediaries.

**Features:**

- Under the framework client will **continue to earn interest on his blocked funds in his savings account till the time amount is debited**.
- There will be a **direct settlement with the clearing corporation (CC), without passing through the pool accounts of the intermediaries,** thereby providing client-level settlement visibility to CC and thus avoiding the risk of co-mingling of clients’ funds and securities.

|Renewables account for **40% of installed power generation globally**, and in 2022, renewables contributed to **83% of global power additions**.|**Developing nations continue** to receive comparatively little investment, and public sector intervention is required to channel investments towards countries more equitably.|

**Key recommendations:**

- **Net-zero commitments** must be embedded in legislation and translated into implementation plans.
- **Every investment and planning decision** should consider the structure and geography of the low-carbon economy of the future.
- Deployment levels of renewables must grow from some 3,000 GW today to over 10,000 GW in 2030 to keep **5°C alive**
