### [Ayurveda practitioners Vs Allopathy doctors](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/27/ayurveda-practitioners-vs-allopathy-doctors/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus****: Government Policies**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cant-treat-ayurveda-physicians-at-par-with-allopathy-doctors-sc/article66782266.ece#:~:text=The%20Supreme%20Court%20on%20Wednesday,and%20entitled%20to%20equal%20pay.) 

**Context**: The Supreme Court of India has set **aside a 2012 Gujarat High Court** order which held that [**Ayurveda practitioners**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/15/ayurveda-regulation-of-this-alternate-system-of-medicine-is-urgently-needed-on-many-fronts-here-is-why/) **working** in government hospitals should be treated at par with allopathy doctors and entitled to equal pay.

**SC contention:**

- Both categories of doctors were **not performing equal work to be entitled to equal pay.**
- Allopathy doctors were required to **perform emergency duties and provide trauma care**, which could not be performed by [Ayurveda doctors](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/06/editorial-analysis-the-hardships-of-a-career-in-ayurvedic-practice/).
- **Complicated medical conditions and post-mortem/autopsy** cannot be carried out by Ayurveda doctors
- **Doctors with MBBS degrees attend to hundreds of patients** during outpatient days in general hospitals, which is not the case for Ayurveda practitioners.

### [Rising sea levels and their disastrous consequences](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/27/rising-sea-levels-and-their-disastrous-consequences/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Environment, Conservation**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/rising-sea-levels-threaten-agriculture-rainfall-social-fabric/article66781156.ece)

 **Context:** As per the **WMO’s ‘**[**State of the Global Climate 2022**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/22/state-of-the-global-climate-2022/)**’ report**, the world’s sea level is rising at an unprecedented rate.

**Rising sea levels: The rate of global mean sea-level [GSML] rise** has doubled from **2.27** mm/year in 1993-2002 to **4.62** mm/year in 2013-2022.

 **GSML budget (individual contribution of these factors):** Loss of glaciers and ice sheets contributed 36% to the GSML rise (between 2005-2019), Ocean warming (55%), and changes in the storage of land water (less than 10%).

**Causes:**

- [**Ocean warming**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/07/07/sansad-tv-nature-and-you-ocean-warming-is-alarming/) (increasing concentrations of CO2 and other GHGs drive global warming, 90% of the extra heat is stored in the oceans),
- **Ice loss from** [**glaciers**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/world-geography/physical-geography-of-the-world/geomorphology/external-forces-their-impact/landforms-developed-out-of-external-forces/erosion-by-ice-glacier/significance-of-glaciers/) **and ice sheets**. Earth’s ice cover/cryosphere includes the
    - Arctic and Antarctic regions (called sea ice),
    - Glaciers,
    - Ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica,
    - Seasonal snow cover, and
    - Permafrost (mass of land that remains below 0ºC for at least two straight years).

**Effects:**

- It will cause **changes in land cover** – seas swallowing more of the land cover.
- The chances of weather formations **like cyclones could increase**.
- Changes in **land water storage** → **more seawater could seep into the ground** → Groundwater (usually freshwater) turning saline.
- Water crises in coastal areas → impacting agriculture in adjacent regions → **displacement** of hundreds of thousands of people → increasing **social disparities and economic liabilities** of governments.

**Most vulnerable: Coastal communities particularly in tropical countries** like India and South Africa, which have high population densities.

**Case study (Impact of sea-level rise on societies):**

- **The Sunderban Delta in West Bengal** is the world’s largest mangrove area.
- The lives of coastal communities, including their economic activities, are tied intricately with the **coastal ecosystem**.
- Rising sea levels and coastal erosion **has left more islands submerged under water**, endangering socio-economic stability and has forced local communities to **migrate**.
- A combination of these forces has increased **child trafficking** in the Sundarbans.

**Way ahead:**

- More reports are required to generate and accumulate data on [climate change](https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/climate-change-and-associated-issues/).
- These reports should also press for **global and local policy-level changes** related to climate change.

### [Left Wing Extremism (LWE)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/27/left-wing-extremism-lwe/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Challenges to Internal Security**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/why-maoists-repeatedly-attack-in-chhattisgarh-8577726/)

 **Context:** Ten personnel of the Chhattisgarh Police’s District Reserve Guard (DRG) were reported killed in an IED attack by Maoists in the state’s Dantewada district.

**The** [**left-wing extremism (LWE**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/security-issues/extremism/left-wing-extremism/#:~:text=The%20left%2Dwing%20extremism%20(LWE,Chinese%20political%20leader%20Mao%20Zedong.)**) or Naxal insurgency in India:**

- It originated in a **1967** uprising in Naxalbari (West Bengal) by the Communist Party of India (Marxist).
- Naxals are a group of people who believe in the political theory derived from the teachings of the Chinese political leader **Mao Zedong**.

  **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/red.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/red.png)**

**Causes:** Inequitable development, Displacement of people (eviction from lands traditionally used by tribals), etc.

**Strategy:** They believe that the solution to social and economic discrimination is to **overthrow** (by force) the existing political system.

**Govt. measures to solve LWE:**

- The Home Ministry came up with the –
    - The strategy of
    - **The LWE Division** to implement security-related schemes aimed at capacity building in the LWE-affected States.
- Modernising the police force (**SMART, CCTNS,** [**NATGRID**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/09/13/national-intelligence-grid-or-natgrid/))
- **Social Integration** (surrender and rehabilitation policy, skill development)
- Development (Infrastructure – mobile towers)
- The state governments have also launched several counter-insurgency measures. **For example**, Andhra Pradesh established an elite force called **Greyhounds** to successfully crack down on Naxal leaders.

**Current situation:**

- The influence of Maoists and associated violence has been **falling consistently** (gone down by 77% since 2010 and resultant deaths by 90% to 98 in 2022) in the country.
- **A general disenchantment with the Maoist ideology** among the youth has deprived the insurgent movement of new leadership.
- The government has cut the number of districts declared to be Naxal-affected from over 200 in the early 2000s to just **90 now.**
- The presence of Naxals is said to be minimal to zero in A**ndhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha, Jharkhand, and Bihar.**
- The Home Ministry has vowed to rid the country of the Maoist problem by **2024**.

**A widely accepted principle in counter-Maoist strategy:**

- The war against Left Wing Extremism **can only be won by the state police** and not central forces.
- This is because the state police have **local knowledge, understand the language, and have local networks** that are essential for the generation of intelligence.

**Situation in Chhattisgarh:**

- It is the only state in the country where Maoists continue to have a significant presence.
- **In the last five years** (2018-22), 1,132 violent incidents, in which 168 security forces personnel and 335 civilians lost their lives, accounted for over a third of all Maoist-related violence.

**Why did the Maoists attack in Chhattisgarh at this time?**

- The onset of the monsoon makes it difficult to conduct offensive operations in the jungles.
- Almost all major attacks by Maoists on security forces have taken place during the **Tactical Counter Offensive Campaigns (TCOCs)** period in the summer.
- The TCOC period this year has been characterised by **increasing improvised explosive device (IED) attacks.**

**Why does Chhattisgarh continue to remain troubled?**

- The counter-insurgency measures **started late** in Chhattisgarh.
- By this time, the police of neighbouring states had pushed Maoists from their states to Chhattisgarh, making it a **concentrated zone** of Maoist influence.
- The special unit of the Chhattisgarh Police, the DRG, was **raised from the local tribal population and trained to fight Maoists** and has become active relatively recently.
- **The absence of roads** and **minimal presence of the administration** in the interiors of Bastar has **stymied the operations of security forces** and **ensured Maoists’ influence** through a mix of fear and goodwill.

**How has the Centre responded?**

- Apart from supporting LWE states through **Security Related Expenditure (SRE)**, the Special Infrastructure Scheme (SIS) aims to strengthen local police and intelligence setups.
- Through the **Special Central Assistance** for building infrastructure (roads), the Centre has maintained **a massive presence of the CRPF in the affected states.**
- The Centre has also unleashed the Counter-terrorism **National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the Enforcement Directorate** on CPI(Maoist) cadres.

**Conclusion:** The Chhattisgarh experience demands an urgent revisiting of the existing counter-insurgency strategy → **a security-centric approach**. The most appropriate thing at this juncture would be to open the channels for political dialogues with Maoists.

**Context**: Recently, Bengaluru experienced a ‘**Zero Shadow Day’**, when vertical objects appear to cast no shadow.

**About Zero Shadow Day:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
||**Description**|
|**Definition**|Zero Shadow Day is a phenomenon where the sun is exactly overhead and vertical objects appear to cast no shadow. It happens **twice a year for every point** on Earth between the **Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn**.|
|**Causes**|Earth’s rotation axis is tilted at an angle of **roughly 23.5° to the axis** of revolution around the Sun|
|**Occurrence**|One day during **Uttarayan** (Sun moves northwards from **winter solstice to summer solstice**) and one day during **Dakshinayan** (Sun moves southwards from summer solstice to winter solstice)|
|**Latitude**|Occurs at latitudes equal to the angle between the Sun’s location and the equator on that day|
|**Bengaluru Example**|Experienced Zero Shadow Day on April 25, 2023, at 12:17 pm local time along 13-degree Latitude, with the next one expected on August 18, 2023|
|As the Earth revolves around the Sun, it also rotates on its axis. During the year, the **Sun’s location moves from 23.5 degrees south** of the celestial equator to **23.5 degrees** north of the equator (Uttarayan), and then back again (Dakshinayan). All places whose **latitude equals the angle between the Sun’s location and the equator** on that day experience Zero Shadow Day<br><br>[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/zero_shadow.jpg?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/zero_shadow.jpg)|   |

**Context:** According to a new study published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, **galaxy mergers likely ignite quasars**, the most powerful and brightest objects in the universe.

**About** [**Quasars**](https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/universe_level2/quasars.html)**:**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Property**|**Description**||
|**Definition**|Quasars (short for “**quasi-stellar radio source**“) are very luminous objects in faraway galaxies that emit jets at radio frequencies|
|**Detection**|First detected in the 1960s|
|**Emits**|Radio waves, visible light, ultraviolet rays, infrared waves, X-rays, and gamma-rays|
|**Size**|Most are **larger than our solar system**, approximately 1 kiloparsec in width|
|**Location**|Only found in galaxies with **supermassive black holes** that power the bright discs|
|**Formation**|As matter **falls into the black hole**, it emits a tremendous amount of energy, creating a very bright and luminous disc around the black hole. Quasars are formed by the **energy emitted by materials swirling around a blackhole** right before being sucked into it|   |
|**Types**|**Radio-loud**: About **10% of the overall quasar population** with powerful jets that are strong sources of radio-wavelength emission<br><br>**Radio-quiet: The majority of quasars (about 90%)** lack powerful jets, with relatively weaker radio emission than the radio-loud population|   |
|**About Black Hole**|Point in space where matter is **so compressed as to create a gravity field** from which even light cannot escape|   |

### [3200 Phaethon](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/27/3200-phaethon/)

**Source:** [**NASA**](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2023/sun/asteroid-s-comet-like-tail-is-not-made-of-dust-solar-observatories-reveal/)

 **Context:** Phaethon, an asteroid that is the source of the annual **Geminid meteor shower**, has been found to have a tail made of **sodium gas rather than dust** as previously thought.

**About Phaethon**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|It is classified as an **asteroid** (the first to be discovered via satellite in 1983) and named after the Greek myth of Phaethon, son of the sun god Helios, due to its close approach to Sun. It is blue in colour, which is rare for an asteroid.|   |
|**Mystery**|Phaethon is an asteroid but it shows comet-like behaviour, by being the source of the annual Geminid meteor shower.|
|**About the Geminid meteor shower**|The Geminids are a prolific meteor shower caused by the **object 3200 Phaethon**, which is thought to be a Palladian asteroid with a “rock comet” orbit. The meteor shower peaks **during mid-December** each year and is considered to be one of the best and most reliable annual meteor showers.|
|**Asteroid Vs Comet**|An asteroid is a **small rocky or metallic body** that orbits the Sun, while a comet is a **small icy body that also orbits the Sun** but is composed of ice, dust, and rock. Asteroids are generally **solid and inactive**, while comets are known for their long tails created by the sublimation of their ice as they approach the Sun.|
|**About Meteor**|A meteor, on the other hand, is a small particle, typically a piece of an asteroid or comet, that enters the Earth’s atmosphere and burns up due to the friction with the air. When a meteor enters the Earth’s atmosphere and starts to glow, it is often referred to as a shooting star or meteorite.|
