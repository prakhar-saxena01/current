### [World Development Report 2023: Migrants, Refugees, and Societies](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/26/world-development-report-2023-migrants-refugees-and-societies/)

#### **GS Paper 1**

 **Syllabus:** **Population and associated issues**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/governance/match-migrants-skills-with-needs-of-ageing-countries-to-drive-global-growth-world-bank-report-88946)

 **Context:** The **‘**World Development Report 2023: Migrants, Refugees, and Societies’ was recently released by the World Bank.

**The World Development Report (WDR):**

- It is an **annual** report published since **1978** by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development **(IBRD) or World Bank.**
- It provides an in-depth analysis of a **specific aspect of economic development**.

**Highlights of the WDR 2023:**

- **The share of working-age adults will drop sharply** in many (developed) countries over the next few decades.
    - **Spain**, with a population of 47 million, is projected to shrink by more than one-third by 2100, with those above age 65 increasing from 20 to 39% of the population.
- Most low-income countries are expected to see rapid population growth, putting them under pressure to create **more jobs for young people**.

**Opportunities offered by migration:**

- **Migration is becoming more urgent** due to **severe divergences between and within countries** – in terms of real wages, labour market opportunities, demographic patterns and climate costs.
- **It can be a unique opportunity** for economies and people as well as meet the growing needs of both origin and destination countries.
- Migrants **transfer ideas, knowledge, and technology, spurring job creation** **and modernisation** – just as US Silicon Valley expatriates did when they helped nurture India’s IT sector.

**Challenges:**

- As populations across the globe **age** at an unprecedented pace, **the global competition for workers and talent will intensify.**
- About 184 million people worldwide (including 37 million refugees) **lack citizenship in the country in which they live.**

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/economic.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/economic.png)**

**Recommendations to promote migration:**

- The WB proposed **policies** to harness economic opportunities and for better migration management in destination, transit and origin countries (to mitigate the risks that migrants face). **For example**,
    - **Origin countries** should make labour migration an explicit part of their development strategy.
    - **Destination countries** should facilitate their **inclusion and address social impacts** that raise concerns among their citizens
- **Match-Motive Framework:** By combining “match” and “motive,” the framework identified policy priorities for countries.
    - **The “match” aspect** is grounded in labour economics and focuses on how well migrants’ skills and related attributes match the needs of the destination countries.
    - **The “motive” refers** to the circumstances under which a person moves in search of opportunity.
    - This determines the extent to which migrants, origin countries and destination countries gain from migration: **The stronger the match, the larger the gains**.
- The report also urged for **international cooperation and multilateral efforts** to strengthen the match of migrants’ skills with the needs of destination societies.

 **Context:** Fifty years ago, on **April 24, 1973**, the SC delivered its landmark judgment in **Kesavananda Bharati vs the State of Kerala**.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|[**Kesavananda Bharati vs State of Kerala**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/04/27/basic-structure-and-the-kesavananda-bharati-case/#:~:text=The%20case%20of%20Kesavananda%20Bharati,not%20be%20amended%20by%20Parliament.)|   |
|**What was the case about?**|**The extent of Parliament’s power** to amend the Constitution was the backdrop of the **tussle between the executive and the judiciary** in the first two decades of the republic.<br><br>By the **1st Amendment of 1951**, the 9th Schedule was inserted – any law placed in this Schedule could not be questioned in any court of law.<br><br>In  **Shankari Prasad v. Union of India (1951),** the SC upheld the 1st Amendment and held that Parliament’s power to amend any part of the Constitution was limitless.<br><br>In **Sajjan Singh v. State of Rajasthan (1965)**, the SC asked whether the Parliament could take away even the critical fundamental rights<br><br>In **Golaknath v State of Punjab (1967)**, the SC ruled that Parliament cannot amend fundamental rights.<br><br>The **24th Amendment 1971** – amended **Articles 13, 368** – provided Parliament with the powers to amend any provision of the Constitution and insulated such amendments from **Judicial Review.**|
|**Verdict**|**A 13-judge Constitution Bench** of the SC (with a 7-6 majority) redefined the relationship between Parliament and the Constitution by ruling that the “**basic structure**” of the Constitution is inviolable, and cannot be amended by Parliament.<br><br>While the Parliament had vast powers to amend the Constitution, **certain parts** (“basic structure”) **are so inherent and intrinsic to the Constitution** that even Parliament cannot touch it.|
|**What is the basic structure doctrine?**|The origins of the basic structure doctrine are found in the **German Constitution**.<br><br>**In India**, while parliamentary democracy, fundamental rights, judicial review, and secularism are all held by courts as basic structures, **the list is not exhaustive** (decided by the court on a case-by-case basis).<br><br>The basic structure doctrine has **formed the bedrock of** [**judicial review**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/structure-organization-and-functioning-of-the/judiciary/judicial-review/#:~:text=Judicial%20review%20is%20the%20power,challenged%20by%20the%20affected%20person.) of all laws passed by the Indian Parliament.|

**A scrutiny of the application of the doctrine over the past 50 years:**

- Although the highest court has invoked “basic structure” **sparingly**, it has **mostly struck down amendments where judicial powers** have been curtailed.
- Since 1973, the Constitution has been **amended more than 60 times**. In at least **16 cases**, the SC has evaluated constitutional amendments with regard to the basic structure doctrine.
- **9/16** constitutional amendments have been upheld by the SC. **6 of these cases relate to** [**reservations**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/01/22/50-reservation-limit/) [OBC, EWS and reservations in promotions].

**Constitutional amendment entirely stuck down by the SC:**

- **The** [**Constitution (99th Amendment) Act 2014**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/05/30/national-judicial-appointments-commission-njac/), which established the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) was struck down in 2015 on the grounds that it threatened “**judicial independence**” – a basic feature of the Constitution.
- **NJAC** would have been responsible for the appointment and transfer of judges, replacing the current Collegium system.

**Constitutional amendments partially stuck down by the SC:**

- **In 6 instances**, including the Kesavananda ruling itself, the SC has “partially struck down” a constitutional amendment.
- In all these cases, the provision that was struck down related to the **denial of judicial review.**

**6 instances when SC partially stuck down an amendment:** Out of 6, 5 were during the Indira Gandhi era.

- **Kesavananda Bharati vs State of Kerala (1973):** While the court upheld the land ceiling laws that were challenged, **it struck down the following portion of the 25th Amendment (1972)** –
    - If any law is passed to give effect to the **DPSP** it cannot be deemed to be void on the ground that it abridged rights under **Articles 14, 19 or 31**.
- **Indira Gandhi v Raj Narain (1975):** The SC struck down The Constitution (39th Amendment) Act 1975, which barred it from hearing a challenge to the election of President, PM, VP, and Speaker of Lok Sabha.
- **Minerva Mills Ltd vs Union Of India (1980):** The SC struck down a clause inserted in **Article 368**, which said there shall be **no limitation on the constituent power of Parliament**.
- **P Sambamurthy v State of Andhra Pradesh (1986):** The SC struck down a portion of the 32nd Amendment (1973), which constituted an Administrative Tribunal for Andhra Pradesh, **taking away the jurisdiction of the High Court.**
- **L Chandra Kumar v Union of India (1997):** The top court struck down a portion of the 42nd Amendment 1976, which set up administrative tribunals excluding judicial review by High Courts.
- [**Kihoto Hollohan vs Zachillhu And Others (1992**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/07/18/karnataka-crisis-what-was-scs-kihoto-hollohan-order-of-1992-what-is-the-role-of-speaker/)**):** The SC upheld The Constitution (**52nd** Amendment) Act that introduced the **10th Schedule/anti-defection law** in the Constitution.
    - However, the only portion of the amendment that was struck down was that **the decisions of the Speaker relating to disqualification cannot be judicially reviewed**.

**Significance of the verdict:**

- The ruling (by the narrowest possible margin of 7-6) has **rejected majoritarian impulses** and **underlined the foundations of a modern democracy** saving both the **constitution and constitutionalism**.
- However, it marked **a definite assertion of the judiciary** against the majoritarian Parliament leading to **Parliamentary sovereignty vs Judicial supremacy,** [**Judicial activism vs overreach**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/structure-organization-and-functioning-of-the/judiciary/judicial-activism-and-judicial-over-reach/)
- A highly controversial **pluralist judicial creation** has been **accepted now** by legislatures, the executive, and the people of India.

### [Powers of the governor under Article 200](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/26/powers-of-the-governor-under-article-200/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Issues and Challenges Pertaining to the Federal Structure**

**Source:** [**Scroll**](https://scroll.in/latest/1047932/governors-should-clear-bills-as-soon-as-possible-says-supreme-court)

 **Context:** The SC said that governors should clear bills passed by the legislative assemblies as soon as possible, as mandated under Article 200 of the Indian Constitution.

**Article 200:**

- **It gives governors the power to either grant assent** to a bill, withhold assent or reserve the bill for the president’s consideration in certain cases.
- **The governor may return the bill** (if it is not a Money Bill) requesting the House/Houses to reconsider the bill.
- If such a bill is passed again by the House/Houses with/without amendment and presented to the governor for assent, **the governor shall not withhold assent.**

**The plea in the SC:** A plea was filed by the Telangana government **seeking directions to the governor** to clear ten bills passed by the state Assembly.

**What are the SC’s observations?**

- Article 200 states that the governor must “**as soon as possible**” after the presentation of the bill for assent return the bill for reconsideration to the House/Houses of the state legislature.
- The expression “as soon as possible” has **a significant constitutional intent and must be borne into mind.**

**The issue:**

- The issue that is agitating State governments (**Kerala, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Chhattisgarh and West Bengal**) is the non-decision/indecision on the part of the governor on a bill passed by the Assembly.
- In a new constitutional development, **the TN Assembly passed a resolution** urging the President of India **to fix a timeline for assent** to be given to bills passed by the Assembly.

**Why is this resolution a new constitutional development?**

- **Article 355 of the Constitution** says that it shall be the duty of the Union to ensure that the government of every State is carried on in accordance with the Constitution.
    - This provision justifies the “**invasion of the provincial field**” by the Union government and the proclamation of the **President’s rule** (under Article 356) in a State.
- If the governor violates Article 200 and **sits on the bills indefinitely** (an option not given by the Constitution), s/he is creating a situation where **governance of the state cannot be carried on in accordance with the Constitution**.
- In such a situation, **the government of the State has a constitutional duty to invoke Article 355** and request the President to give suitable instructions to the Governor.

**The practice followed in the United Kingdom**:

- The veto could **only be exercised on ministerial advice**.
- Refusal of royal assent on the ground that the monarch strongly disapproves of a bill/ it was intensely controversial would be **unconstitutional**.

**Case of India:**

- **Under Article 154 of the Constitution**, the governor can exercise his/her executive powers **only on the advice of the Council of Ministers**.
- Whether the Governor (under Article 200) can withhold his/her assent to a bill in the exercise of his/her **discretionary powers?**
- Under the constitutional scheme, the governor is **only a constitutional head** and has no real powers.
- According to constitutional experts, **the governor can withhold assent to a bill only on ministerial advice.**
- Hence, there is a **confusion** on the issue in India.

**Way ahead:**

- A bill is **a policy imperative of the elected government which is responsible to the people**.
- Withholding assent means the **death of the bill**. Therefore, the government can challenge the inaction of the governor in a court of law.
- **The SC must fix a reasonable time frame** for governors to take a decision on a bill passed by the Assembly in the **larger interest of federalism** in the country.

### [India and SCO](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/26/india-and-sco/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus****: International Relations – Regional grouping**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/c-raja-mohan-sco-meet-china-growing-role-asia-india-challenge-8575040/)

 **Context:** Chinese and Russian defence ministers are attending a ministerial meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in Delhi this week. Also, India will chair the Eurasian regional forum this year.

**About SCO:**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
||**Information**|   |
|**Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) (est. 2001; HQ: Beijing) is a Eurasian political, economic, international security and defence organization.**|   |   |
|**Type**|Permanent intergovernmental international organisation|   |
|**Need**|After the **collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991,** the then security and economic architecture in the Eurasian region dissolved and **new structures** had to come up.|[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/shanghai.jpg?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/shanghai.jpg)|
|**Members**|China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, and Tajikistan (not Turkmenistan), were the original ‘**Shanghai Five’**. Uzbekistan was included afterwards. India and Pakistan joined the organization in 2017|
|**Key priorities**|Regional non-traditional security, counter-terrorism; Fight against the “**three evils” of terrorism, separatism and extremism**|   |
|**Observers**|Iran, Afghanistan, Belarus, and Mongolia|   |
|**Current Head**|India is the current chair of  SCO|   |
|**Internal conflicts within SCO**|Between India and China; India and Pakistan; Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan; Pakistan and Taliban-led Afghanistan; and **No Central Asian neighbour** has endorsed the Russian invasion of Ukraine.|   |

**How India gains from SCO:**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Dimensions**||**Benefits for India**|
|**Geopolitical Balance**|Asian Player|SCO bolsters **India’s status as a major pan-Asian player** which is currently limited in the South Asian paradigm.|
|Multi-alignment|Against the backdrop of the **Russia-Ukraine war; US’ power struggle with China and sanctions on Iran**. SCO helps India engage with all sides.|
|“Shanghai Spirit”|It emphasises India’s foreign policy of **harmony, non-interference** in others’ internal affairs, and non-alignment.|
|**Regional Engagement**|Facilitates Bilateral Engagement|E.g., India is a major trade partner of Russia and China|
|Informal Meeting Opportunities|The SCO summit gives an opportunity for Indian and Pakistani leaders; the India-Chinese delegation; India-Russian leaders to meet informally, on the sidelines.|
|**Security dimensions**|E.g., India wants access to intelligence and information from SCO’s counter-terrorism body, the **Tashkent-based Regional Anti-Terror Structure** (RATS). Also, India through SCO can help in the stability of Afghanistan.|   |
|**Connectivity**|E.g., International North-South Transport Corridor|   |

**India’s challenges in dealing with SCO:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Challenge**|**Description**|
|**Differences between India and Pakistan**|Differences on cross-border terrorism, geopolitics, Kashmir dispute.|
|**Differences between India and China**|India’s concern over China’s BRI initiative and Chinese expansionist policy on India’s borders.|
|**Intelligence sharing**|India may be hesitant to share intelligence with Pakistan and China within the SCO’s anti-terrorism structures.|
|**SCO’s Stance on Kashmir**|The SCO may not take a firm stance on the Kashmir dispute that India would like. **China is likely to take Pakistan’s side**, creating tensions.|
|**Limited support for the India-China border dispute**|The SCO’s other members **may not have the capability to stand up to China in any border dispute** between India and China, limiting the SCO’s ability to help India.|
|**Containing China’s rise**|India wants to **contain China’s influence in the region**, but joint containment efforts may not happen within the confines of the SCO.|
|**Afghanistan is not part of SCO**|Cooperation with Central Asian states is important for India in combating terrorism in Afghanistan, but Afghanistan is not part of the SCO.|

**Conclusion:**

While the SCO has been successful in attracting a growing number of regional states, its internal contradictions are casting a shadow over its strategic coherence.

### [Indoor air pollution](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/26/indoor-air-pollution/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Environmental Pollution & Degradation**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/pollution/indoor-air-pollution-can-slow-down-brain-development-in-infants-study-88951)

 **Context:** According to a study, India’s poor indoor air quality can impair cognitive development in children under two years when brain growth is at its peak.

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/indoor.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/indoor.png)

**Highlights of the study:**

- Poor air quality in households that used solid cooking materials such as **cow dung cake**.
- **Very small particulate fragments** (PM 2.5) in the air are a major concern as they can move from the respiratory tract into the **brain**.
- Infants (<2 years) from these houses had **lower visual memory scores and slower visual processing speeds**.
- As children grow up in polluted environments, **their developing organs and bodies are affected.**

**Impact:** Long-term consequences for life → lower economic productivity → increased burden on healthcare and mental health systems.

**Concerns for India:**

- According to the State of Global Air 2020 report, **over 116,000 infants in India died** within a month of birth in 2019 due to air pollution, outdoor and indoor.
- Every third child in Delhi has impaired lungs making them vulnerable to **metabolic diseases.**

**Recommendations:** Since indoor air quality is linked to cooking fuels, **efforts to reduce cooking emissions should be a key target for intervention.**

**Control measures:**

- Public awareness
- Change in pattern of fuel use **(PM Ujjwala Yojana,** National Biogas and Manure Management Programme, **GOBARdhan Scheme)**
- Modification of design of cooking stove (**Unnat Chulha Abhiyan**)
- Improvement in ventilation
- Intersectoral coordination and global initiative

### [Relative humidity](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/26/relative-humidity/)

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/relative-humidity-psychrometric-chart-wet-bulb-temperature-heatwaves/article66772463.ece#:~:text=The%20higher%20the%20relative%20humidity%20of%20air%2C%20the%20more%20it,still%20expecting%20to%20cool%20itself.)

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|**Type of Humidity**|**Definition**|**Unit of Measurement**|**Factors Affecting**|
|**Humidity**|Humidity is the amount of moisture present in the air around us.|   |   |
|**Absolute Humidity**|The actual amount of water vapour present in the atmosphere|grams/m³|Temperature, Location|
|**Relative Humidity**|Percentage of moisture present in the atmosphere compared to its full capacity at a given temperature|%|Temperature, Availability of water for evaporation (Higher the RH of air, the more it is filled with moisture)|
|**Dew Point**|The temperature at which saturation occurs in a given sample of air|°C|Temperature, Relative Humidity|
|**Specific Humidity**|Weight of water vapour per unit weight of air|g/kg|   |

**Why does relative humidity matter?**

Relative humidity plays a significant role in how comfortable we feel in different environments. When the **relative humidity is high**, the air is already filled with moisture, and the sweat on **our skin can’t evaporate**. This makes it difficult for our bodies to cool down, which can be **dangerous in hot weather**. In general, a relative **humidity of 30-60%** is considered comfortable, and environments with lower humidity may require humidifiers to increase moisture levels. On the other hand, a fan can be useful in areas with higher humidity to help move the air and promote sweat evaporation.

**What is Wet Bulb Temperature?**

Wet bulb temperature is the **lowest temperature to which air can be cooled by the evaporation of water** at constant pressure, and it is a **limit beyond which humans cannot tolerate high temperatures**. It is measured by wrapping a wet cloth on a thermometer to observe the temperature at which evaporation occurs. The highest acceptable wet-bulb temperature for humans is **35°C (95°F) for six hours**, above which serious health problems can develop, even for healthy individuals.
