#### **GS Paper 1**

 **Syllabus:** **Population and Associated Issues**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/un-population-report-key-takeaways-for-india-and-the-world-8565321/#:~:text=The%20UN%20report%20states%20that,youngest%20countries%20in%20the%20world.)

 **Context:** According to the **United Nations Population Fund’s (UNFPA) State of World Population (SOWP)** report 2023 **– ‘8 Billion Lives, Infinite Possibilities’** – [India is now the most populous country](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/07/decoding-indias-population-conundrum/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20UN%20World,reach%201%2C428.6%20million%20in%202023.) in the world.

**Highlights of the report:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Total**|The population of the world is **8,045 million.**|
|**The largest share (age)**|Out of this, **the largest share (65%) is of people between the ages of 15 – 64 years**, followed by those in the 10-24 years group (24%).<br><br>**10% of the population is above 65 years of age**.|
|**The largest share (region)**|The world’s two most populous regions are **Eastern and South-Eastern Asia** [2.3 billion people – 29% of the global population]; and<br><br>Central and Southern Asia [2.1 billion – 26%].|
|**The largest share (countries)**|**China and India** accounted for the largest populations in these regions, with more than 1.4 billion each in 2022.|
|**The outlook for population growth**|While numbers will continue to grow for several decades, the **rate of global population growth has fallen** (<1% since 2020 compared to 5% in 1950).<br><br>This is largely due to **declining fertility** – around two-thirds of people live in areas with a total fertility rate </=**2.1** children per woman → **replacement fertility rate/zero-growth fertility rate.**<br><br>It is **international migration** (due to war, and famines, among other reasons) that is now the driver of growth in many countries, **with 281 million people living outside their country of birth in 2020.**<br><br>**South Asia clocks some of the highest emigration trends**, with India seeing an estimated net outflow of 3.5 million between 2010 and 2021 (Pakistan has the highest net flow).|
|**What contributed to the global population growth?**|**Increasing life expectancy** (among men – 71 years while among women – 76 years). This also means that parts of the world, such as Japan, have a rapidly ageing population.|
|**Projections**|The global population could grow to around **8.5 billion in 2030, 9.7 billion in 2050 and 10.4 billion in 2100.**<br><br>**Central and Southern Asia** is expected to become the most populous region in the world by 2037.<br><br>More than half of the projected increase in global population up to 2050 will be concentrated in **eight countries** – Congo (DRC), Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines and Tanzania.<br><br>Once fertility rates drop in high-fertility regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, the **global population will start to decline**.|

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**India specific findings**|   |   |
|India now has **1,428.6 million people**, outstripping China’s population. India’s growth rate has dropped to <1% from 2.3% in 1972.<br><br>**68%** of India’s population belongs to the 15-64 years category, and **26%** in the 10-24 years group, **making India one of the youngest countries** in the world.<br><br>**The total fertility rate** in India has been steadily dropping [NFHS-5 (2019-21)- **2.0,** less than the replacement level of **2.1**].<br><br>Increased use of contraceptive methods, spacing, access to health care, and increasing wealth and education, has contributed to this decline. <br><br>**Life expectancy** for men in India is 71 years (same as global figures), while it is marginally lower for women at 74 years.<br><br>India’s large population is a result of the “**population momentum**” from earlier decades, and the country’s population is **likely to start its decline closer to 2050.**|   |   |
|**Good**|**Bad**|**Takeaway for India**|
|**Opportunity for India – Demographic dividend**.<br><br>68% of its population is the youth/working population.<br><br>The population in many countries, like Japan and South Korea, are on the decline.<br><br>India could have one of the largest workforces in the world, **giving it a global advantage** (skilled labour to countries which will be in dire need)**, and spurring its economic growth.**|**Increasing dependency:** A declining fertility rate is accompanied by an ageing population.<br><br>**Demographic disaster:** If India fails to capitalise on its demographic dividend/fails to educate and skill its youth.|**Delays in conducting Census exercises can have adverse consequences.**<br><br>The population estimates in the UNFPA report are higher than India’s own.<br><br>According to the Census Office, India’s population in 2023 was expected to be only 1,388 million (about 139 crores).|

### [Nagaland government repeal its municipal act](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/20/nagaland-government-repeal-its-municipal-act/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus****: Local Government**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/explained-why-did-the-nagaland-government-repeal-its-municipal-act/article66753087.ece#:~:text=The%20government%20succumbed%20to%20public,to%20participate%20in%20the%20elections.) 

**Context**: The Nagaland government, repealed the **Nagaland Municipal Act of 2001,** which included  **33% reservation for women** in urban local bodies, in the face of opposition from community-based organizations.

**Background of the Issue:** 

**Nagaland is the only state** in India where seats in Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) are not reserved for women, as mandated by the [**74th Amendment to the Constitution**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/functions-and-responsibilities-of-the-union-and-the-states-issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure-devolution-of-powers-and-finances-up-to-local-levels-and-challenges-therein/devolution-of-powers-and-finances-up-to-local-levels-and-challenges-therein/74th-amendment-act-municipalities/#:~:text=All%20members%20of%20the%20municipality,the%20chairperson%20of%20a%20municipality). The State government amended the **2001 Municipal Act in 2006** to include **33% reservation** for women, but this move **faced strong opposition**, leading to the **indefinite postponement** of ULB polls in 2009. Recently, the **Supreme Court pressurized the Nagaland government** to hold ULB polls, but now the government has repealed the Municipal Act 2001.

**Reasons for repealing the Nagaland Municipal Act:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Reasons**|**Examples**|
|**Opposition from traditional tribal organizations**|Several traditional tribal organizations **opposed the 33% reservation of seats for women** as they argue that such reservation would violate the **special provisions granted by Article 371A** of the Constitution to Nagaland.|
|**Violation of customary laws**|The apex tribal bodies **(hohos) in Nagaland** have argued that women have **traditionally not been part of decision-making bodies** and that reservation of seats for women **would violate customary laws.**|
|**Political pressure and public sentiment**|The Nagaland government succumbed to political pressure and public sentiment against the reservation of seats for women in ULBs.|

**Consequences of repealing the Nagaland Municipal Act:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Consequence**|**Description**|
|**Loss of representation for women**|Without the Municipal Act, there is no legal provision for reserving seats for women in urban local bodies.|
|**Potential violation of constitutional provisions**|The repeal of the Municipal Act could be seen as a violation of the 74th Amendment to the Indian Constitution, which mandates the reservation of seats for women in urban local bodies.|
|**Delay in holding local body elections**|It could result in **further delays in holding local body elections**, which were already postponed several times due to opposition from certain groups.|
|**Loss of credibility for the government**|The repeal of the Municipal Act after an **undertaking was given to the Supreme Court** could erode the credibility of the Nagaland government and its commitment to upholding the rule of law.|
|**Ethical concerns**|Gender Equality, Discrimination, Lack of Accountability, and violation of promises|

**Demands of the Tribal Organizations:**

- A **“guarantee” that the 33% quota would not violate the provisions of** [**Article 371A**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/08/07/article-371-of-the-constitution/).
- The **duration of the reservation** should be capped at **two tenures**
- The **post of chairperson** should not be reserved for women.

**About Article 371A:**

Article 371A of the Indian Constitution is a **special provision made for the state of Nagaland,** to provide special safeguards for the protection of the **unique social and cultural practices, customs and traditions** of the Naga people, who have a distinct identity and history.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Major Provisions**|**Description**|
|**Governor’s special responsibility**|The Governor of Nagaland has a special responsibility **to ensure law and order and the administration of justice.**|
|The Governor **must be consulted on all matters concerning the appointment of civil servants** and selection of candidates for admission to educational institutions in Nagaland.|
|**State legislature power**|The state legislature of Nagaland has the power to **enact laws relating to the ownership and transfer of land** and its resources, customary law and practice of the Naga tribes.|
|**Restrictions on Parliament**|Parliament of India is **prohibited from enacting any law that affects the religious or social practices** of the Naga people, their customary law and procedures, or ownership and transfer of land and its resources in Nagaland.|

### [Reforms in Indian Civil Services](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/20/reforms-in-indian-civil-services/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Role of Civil Services in a Democracy**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/manish-sabharwal-writes-for-civil-services-hr-lessons-from-the-military-8565660/)

 **C****ontext:** Copying cutting-edge practices in hiring, specialisation and organisational structure from the Indian military will serve the Indian bureaucracy well.

**Background:**

- The Indian Civil Service exists to [**end poverty**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-economy-3/poverty-and-unemployment/poverty/)**.**
- **The war on poverty is won by raising the productivity** of five physical and conceptual places – states, cities, sectors, firms, and skills.
- **India’s strategy for reducing poverty:**
    - **Generating high-paying jobs** through urbanisation, formalisation, industrialisation, financialisation and human capital.
    - To implement this **India has new policy weapons** like GST, IBC, MPC, UPI, DBT, FDI, PLI, NEP, EODB, privatisation, etc.

**What sabotages the public service outcomes that reduce poverty?**

- The government had an **execution deficit,**
- The private sector had a **trust deficit**,
- Nonprofits had a **scale deficit**, and
- **A dysfunctional Human Resources (HR) regime** for civil servants.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Reforms Needed in Indian civil services**|   |
|**Copying three HR practices from the Indian military**|**Best practices of the Indian military to be adopted by the civil services**|
|**Hiring** (fixed terms for successful candidates)|**Tenure: The courageous Agniveer revamp**: Only 25% of the recruited soldiers stayed on after a fixed duty. It will gradually **raise military capital expenditure**.<br><br>The government must hire all new civil servants for a **fixed 10-year tenure** with rollover percentages decided by a hard-coded organisational structure.|
|**Specialisation** (compounding skills over decades)|A democracy’s generalists are politicians, while **civil servants are technocrats whose mandate changed from ruling to governing**.<br><br>Young military recruits pick an area of expertise early, the Indian civil services must replicate this.|
|**Structure** (performance management forced via a frozen pyramid)|Civil servant selection is **highly meritocratic,** but their careers are adversely influenced by **outdated HR practices that don’t punish bad performers** and therefore punish good performers.<br><br>The performance management system in the military (promotions with honest appraisals) has been more disciplined.|

**How will this transform** [**Indian civil services**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/governance/role-of-civil-service-in-a-democracy/)**?**

- Raise competition, accountability and uncertainty.
- **Raise moral courage**: The ability to speak up irrespective of consequences for yourself.

**Conclusion:**

- The Indian Republic has greatly benefitted from civilian control of the military, but it’s time for the civil services to learn three cutting-edge HR practices from the military.
- Better HR practices in civil services are needed because **wars are fought with weapons but won by people.**

**Context**: India, the **world’s second-largest food producer**, is an essential partner in the UAE’s ambition to strengthen food security.

**Various dimensions of the India-UAE relationship**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Dimension**|**Examples**|
|**Diplomatic**|Establishment of **diplomatic relations in 1972;** reciprocal embassies in each other’s countries; a **strategic partnership** between the two countries in 2015|
|**Economic & Commercial**|Bilateral trade valued at **US$ 72 billion in FY 2021-22;** UAE as India’s **third-largest trade partner** and **second-largest export destination;** UAE comes in the Top 10 destination for FDI in India; India-UAE signed **Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (**CEPA)|
|**Food security**|India is the **world’s second-largest food producer** and UAE is a major importer of Indian food products.|
|**Investment in the Food sector**|**E.g., Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (**UAE’s largest free trade zone) launched **Agriota (**agri-trading and commodity platform) to link Indian farmers to food companies in the UAE.<br><br>In 2022, I2U2 meeting UAE committed $2 billion in investment towards **constructing food parks in India** and establishing a **food security corridor**|
|**Cultural**|**BAPS Hindu temple** is planned in UAE; Indian cinema/TV/radio channels are widely available in UAE, annual International Day of Yoga events|
|**Technology partnerships**|Collaboration between ISRO and UAESA for the **Red Moon mission**, digital innovation, and technology partnerships|
|**Defence and Security**|The recent **I2U2 summits**; Annual defence dialogues, bilateral defence interaction, UAE’s role in Indian Ocean Region dialogue, joint military exercises— **Exercise Desert Flag; In-UAE BILAT** (bilateral naval exercise) and **Desert Eagle-II** (bilateral air force exercise)|
|**Mediation**|The role played by UAE in mediation between India and Pakistan, facilitating meetings between interlocutors including NSA Doval and Pakistan military officials|
|**Indian Community**|Indian expatriate community of approximately 34 lakhs, the largest ethnic community in UAE, comprising roughly about **35% of the country’s population**|

**Challenges/Issues between the two countries:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Challenge**|**Example**|
|**Labour Issues**|There have been reports of **mistreatment and exploitation** of Indian migrant workers in the UAE|
|**Trade Imbalance**|India’s trade deficit with the UAE has been a cause for concern (US $18bn in 2021)|
|**Geopolitical Issues**|The UAE’s growing ties with Pakistan, which has long-standing tensions with India, have been a cause for concern. The UAE has also maintained a **neutral stance on the Kashmir issue,** which India considers an internal matter.|
|**Regional Competition**|For instance, the UAE’s recent investments in the port of Gwadar in Pakistan and the development of Chabahar port in Iran have raised concerns in India.|

**Conclusion:**

The relationship between **India and UAE has strengthened** over the years, with the UAE becoming India’s closest partner in the Arab world. Despite recent challenges, the bilateral ties between the two nations have proven resilient.

### [Cartelization among domestic tyre manufacturers](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/20/cartelization-among-domestic-tyre-manufacturers/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Effects of Liberalisation on the Economy**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/explained-the-allegations-of-cartelisation-among-domestic-tyre-manufacturers/article66737255.ece#:~:text=It%20was%20alleged%20that%20the,when%20raw%20material%20prices%20fell.)

**Context:** The Supreme Court issued notices to five tyre companies and the industry body Automotive Tyre Manufacturers’ Association (ATMA).

**Background:**

- The All-India Tyre Dealers Federation (AITDF) in a reference to the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) alleged 5 tyre companies for coordination**, price parallelism and** [**cartelisation**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/09/27/competition-commission-of-india-and-cartelisation/).
- These companies (control 90% of the tyre production in India) had **raised tyre prices on the pretext of rising prices of raw materials** (natural rubber).
- However, they did not correspondingly decrease prices when raw material prices fell – **not in line with typical competitive market practices**.
- **The Competition Commission of India** (CCI) – the competition regulator, imposed penalties on the five tyre companies (MRF, JK Tyre, Apollo, CEAT and Birla Tyres) alongside ATMA.
- The order was challenged at the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) and was **overturned**.
- Now, CCI has approached the apex court challenging the tribunal’s order.

**About Cartelisation:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Meaning**|According to CCI, **cartelisation is a practice in which a group of competitors (manufacturers, sellers, distributors) come together (agreement) to restrict competition.**|
|**Ill-Effects**|Reduces the output → **increases the price** → Forces consumers out of the market (if they opt not to pay a higher price) → transferring wealth unknowingly (if they opt to pay)<br><br>A cartel protects its members from full market exposure → decreasing cost control → **hurting overall economic performance and innovation.**|
|**Cartels vs monopoly**|A monopolist dominates the concerned market completely (as there is no competitor), while cartels are formed (with the intention to restrict competition) to dominate the market|
|**Laws to stop cartelisation**|**The Competition Act, 2002** seeks **to promote and sustain competition** in markets, protect the interest of consumers, and ensure freedom of trade for market participants.<br><br>It established the **CCI** to eliminate practices having adverse effects on market competition.|
|[**The Competition (Amendment) Bill 2023**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/15/competition-law-amendments-of-penalties-and-misses/)|The amendments proposed to codify the liability of cartel facilitators.<br><br>The CCI **can now impose penalties of up to 10% of the total global turnover of enterprises**.|

### [India’s first environmental referendum](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/20/indias-first-environmental-referendum/)

#### **Content for Mains Enrichment (CME)**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/governance/niyamgiri-10-years-since-india-s-first-environmental-referendum-88850)

Ten years ago, on April 18, 2013, the **Dongoria Kondhs**, a vulnerable tribal group in India, won a landmark legal battle in the Supreme Court against Vedanta Company’s plans to **exploit the Niyamgiri Hill for bauxite**.

**What did the court say?**

The court recognized the **cultural, religious, and spiritual rights** of the tribe on the hill and gave the Gram Sabha the authority to **examine possible infringements** on their rights due to the proposed project. The Supreme Court **ordered a referendum** to be held amongst the affected Gram Sabhas to obtain consent on the project from the community, which unanimously voted against it.

The referendum resulted in a **rare registration of the Dongoria Kondhs’ claim for sovereignty, self-determination, and territorial autonomy.**

**Usage**: Niyamgiri case today serves as a **textbook example of good usage of Free, Prior Informed Consent (FPIC),** for any environmental projects. The case can be a quote in an Essay/Ethics/ Environment question.

 **Context:** Cadbury Bournvita’s products advertisement and product packaging have been found to be misleading as they did not disclose the sugar content.

**FSSAI regulation on the product packaging**:

FSSAI issued **a draft notification on front-of-package labelling** in September 2022 that proposed the “**Indian Nutrition Rating**.” It would notify consumers if a food product was **high in fat, sugar, and salt (HFSS),** allowing them to make an informed choice.

However, FSSAI has been found to have failed at implementing its own regulations.

**How much intake of HFSS is safe?** 

‘

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Nutrient**|**WHO recommended intake**|**The actual average usage in India**|
|**Fat**|Less than 30% of total energy intake (80g per day)|Not available|
|**Salt**|Less than 5 grams per day|10-12 grams per day|
|**Sugar**|Less than 7% of total energy intake (7g per 100gm)|Around 36 grams per day|

**About India Nutrition Ratings (INR)**

 It mandates **pre-packaged foods to carry a star rating similar to the energy-efficiency** ratings on electronic goods, to discourage the consumption of foods high in sugar, salt and fats.

**Context:** The Indian Union Cabinet has approved the National Quantum Mission (NQM), with a budget of ₹6,003 crore, to fund research and development of quantum computing technology and associated applications.

**About National Quantum Mission**

**About Quantum Computing:**

Quantum computing is a new way of **computing that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations**. In traditional computing, data is processed using bits, which are either a 0 or a 1. But in quantum computing, the data is processed using quantum bits or qubits, which can be both a 0 and a 1 at the same time. This property of qubits is called superposition, which allows for multiple calculations to be performed simultaneously, making quantum computing exponentially faster than traditional computing for certain types of problems.
