#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Structure, Organization and Functioning of the Executive and the Judiciary**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/india-justice-report-2022-karnataka-tops-among-18-large-states-in-delivery-of-justice/article66698157.ece)

**Context:** According to the **India Justice Report (IJR) 2022** (3rd edition), the **State of Karnataka emerged at the top** among the 18 large and mid-sized States with populations of over one crore.

**Background:**

- The Report (initiated by Tata Trusts in 2019) is a **first-of-its-kind national periodic report** that ranks the **capacity of states to deliver justice**.
- It assesses the capacity of **4 core pillars of the justice system**:
    - Police,
    - Prisons,
    - Judiciary and
    - Legal aid across all 36 states and UTs.
- Each pillar was **analyzed through the prism** of budgets, human resources, workload, diversity, infrastructure and trends against the state’s own declared standards and benchmarks.
- The Report is a **collaborative effort undertaken in partnership** with DAKSH, Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy, TISS-Prayas, etc.
- The IJR 2022 also separately assesses the capacity of the **25 State Human Rights Commissions** in the country.

**The IJR 2022:**

- The State of **UP** is at the lowest rank (18th) among mid-sized and large States (population > 1 crore), while the State of **Goa** is at the lowest rank (7th) among the small States with a (population < 1 crore).

### [Why India should cut down on its salt intake](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/05/why-india-should-cut-down-on-its-salt-intake/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus:** **Issues Relating to Development and Management of Social Sector/Services relating to Health**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/why-india-should-cut-down-on-its-salt-intake/article66695361.ece#:~:text=The%20seemingly%20innocuous%20act,revaluation%20of%20our%20dietary%20choices.)

 **Context:** Excessive sodium (salt) intake contributes to the rise of hypertension, heart disease and stroke.

**Why is it essential to reduce sodium intake?**

- Salt reduction is a **cost-effective and practical approach** to preventing cardiovascular disease (the foremost cause of mortality worldwide).
    - Reduced sodium intake → decreased blood pressure → decrease in stroke and heart attack incidences.
- **Staggering economic impact** of cardiovascular disease on low- and middle-income countries: ~2% of the GDP of LMICs due to premature mortality and disability.

**India Scenario:** Average sodium consumption is **more than double** the physiological need and exceeds the **WHO’s recommended daily intake of <5 g of salt for adults**.

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/salt.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/salt.png)

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Global Efforts**|**Challenges**|
|●       The WHO’s **“Global Report on Sodium Intake Reduction” report** details the 194 member states’ efforts **toward a 30% reduction** in (population) sodium intake by 2025.<br><br>●       The WHO devised **a sodium score**, ranging from 1 (least) to 4 (highest implementation), based on the extent of implementation of **sodium reduction measures**.|With only a few countries making considerable headway, **there is a proposal to extend the deadline from 2025 to 2030.**|
|**India Effort**|   |
|●       The Union government has initiated **several voluntary programmes** aimed at encouraging Indians to decrease their sodium consumption.<br><br>●       **Eat Right India’s movement: FSSAI** strives to transform the nation’s food system to ensure secure, healthy, and sustainable nutrition for all citizens.<br><br>●       **Aaj Se Thoda Kam:** A social campaign launched by FSSAI.|●       **Cardiovascular diseases** have emerged as the primary cause of mortality and morbidity.<br><br>○       The WEF projects that the Indian economy faces **losses surpassing $2 trillion between 2012 and 2030** due to such diseases.<br><br>●       **Hypertension** has been identified as the leading risk factor for such diseases.<br><br>○       More prevalent among **men aged 15 and above** compared to women.<br><br>○       More common in **southern States**.<br><br>○       **Circulatory system diseases** account for **32.1%** of all documented deaths, with hypertension being a major risk factor.<br><br>●       **The pre-hypertensive population** warrants attention.<br><br>●       **India’s score of 2** (in the WHO’s sodium score) signifies the presence of **at least one voluntary policy**, emphasizing the need for more rigorous efforts to address this health concern.|

**Way ahead:**

- India needs **a comprehensive national strategy** to curb salt consumption.
- **A multi-pronged approach**, engaging consumers, industry, and the government, is crucial.
- **Collaboration** between State and Union governments is essential to combat hypertension.

|**World Water Day**|22 March 2023, with the theme “**Accelerating change”**|
|**SDG no. 6 for water**|Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all|

**Also, read the recently released** [UN World Water Development Report 2023](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/23/un-world-water-development-report-2023/)

**Outcome of the Water Conference:** The **Water Action Agenda** contains over 700 voluntary commitments. Some of them have been given here with examples:

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus: Energy**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/india-could-become-the-worlds-second-largest-solar-photovoltaic-manufacturer-by-2026-report/article66695747.ece)

 **Context:** According to a new report, India will become self-sufficient and will be the 2nd-largest photovoltaic (PV) manufacturing country after China by 2026.

**Highlights of the report:**

- **110 gigawatts** (GW) of solar PV module capacity is set to come online in India in the next three years
- India’s cumulative module manufacturing capacity more than doubled **from 18GW in March 2022 to 38GW in March 2023.**
- In terms of upcoming PV manufacturing installations, **Gujarat** (accounts for nearly 57%) is the leading state in India, due to **cheaper industrial electricity prices and easy access to ports for imports/exports**.

**Initiatives taken by the Indian govt:** A favourable policy environment like the **Production linked incentive (PLI) scheme**.

**Challenges for India:**

- Policy instability
- **To compete for dominance** in both quality and scale in the global PV module market
- **Reliance on China** for upstream components of PV modules such as polysilicon and ingots/wafers
- **A dearth of skilled manpower**
- India’s current major PV export markets (U.S. and Europe) **are ramping up their own PV manufacturing capabilities.**

**Lessons to be learnt from China:**

- China has already achieved **economies of scale by** **offering policy support** – cheap credit, free land, cheap loans, research funds, tax rebates, etc.
- Chinese manufacturers are able to **absorb larger shares of the profit** of their operational revenues → **invest significantly in a robust R&D infrastructure** → stay ahead of the rest of the world.

**Recommendations:**

- For holistic development, **the government must augment the PLI scheme** to also include more upstream components.
- India must aim to build **enough PV capacity to satisfy local demand** and maintain a healthy global presence to become a viable competitor to Chinese PV products.
- There must be **a greater impetus to explore other export markets** for Indian tier-1 manufacturers.

**Context:** Hyderabad-based National Geophysical Research Institute has found large deposits of 15 rare earth elements (REE) in Andhra Pradesh’s Anantapur district.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**About Rare Earth Metal**|**Description**|
|**Definition**|Rare Earth Metals are a **set of 17 metallic elements, including the 15 lanthanides and scandium and yttrium**.|
|**Name**|They are called **“rare earth”** because they occur in **low concentrations** of minerals and were difficult to extract from their oxide forms.|
