### [Heat stroke](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/18/heat-stroke/)

#### **GS Paper 1**

 **Syllabus:** **Important geophysical phenomenon/Disaster management**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/mumbai-deaths-heat-stroke-precautions-explained-8560633/)

 **Context:** 13 people died due to heatstroke after they attended a large public gathering in the open in Kharghar, Navi Mumbai.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Heat stroke**|   |
|**Meaning**|Heat stroke/sunstroke/hyperthermia is the result of **overheating of the body** as a result of **exposure to high temperatures and humidity**.|
|**Causes**|The combination of [high temperature](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/07/even-with-moderate-emissions-indias-heat-is-set-to-get-worse/) and high humidity → **wet bulb temperature** → makes heat waves deadly.<br><br>High moisture content in the atmosphere **makes it difficult for sweat to evaporate and for bodies to cool down**.<br><br>As a result of which the internal body **temperature increases sharply** → 41 degree Celsius or higher within 10 to 15 minutes.|
|**Impact**|Persons suffering from heat exhaustion/dehydration (which is a milder form of heat-related illness) experience **fatigue, dizziness, headache, nausea, vomiting, hypotension** (low blood pressure) and **tachycardia** (increased heart rate).<br><br>Heat stroke can cause **permanent disability or death** if the person does not receive emergency treatment.|
|**Dos and don’ts**|**Stay hydrated**, cover yourself well; Use sunglasses, umbrellas or hats; Avoid alcohol, tea, coffee and carbonated soft drinks; Carry ORS and homemade drinks; Avoid high-protein food.|
|**NDMA advisory for political gatherings**|**During election campaigning**, parties are supposed to ensure that water, ORS packets, medical kits, and mobile ambulances are readily available at all such events.<br><br>**During voting**, electoral officers were advised to ensure that every polling booth had provisions for drinking water, functional clean toilets, facilities for people to sit, some areas under shade, and essential medical kits.|

**Why did a heat stroke event happen in Maharashtra?**

- Two different observatories **recorded 34.1 and 38 degrees Celsius** as the maximum temperatures, which is **normal** during this time of the year.
- **No** [**heat wave**](http://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Increasing-Heat-Waves.pdf) **warnings** – for coastal stations **maximum temperature departure is 4.5 degrees Celsius or more than normal –** were issued by the IMD.
- Long exposure to heat in the **open ground, physical exertion,** elderly patients, and patients with high cholesterol and cardiac illnesses may have had a role to play.

**The sharp decline in heat-related deaths in India:**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/heat_linked.jpg?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/heat_linked.jpg)

- **Monitoring and management** of heatwaves have undergone a big improvement.
- Almost every vulnerable state now has a [**heat action plan**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/28/without-action-plans-indias-poorest-will-continue-to-bear-brunt-of-heatwaves-study/) (early warning, provision of water/ORS at public places and flexible working hours in offices/education institutions) **in place.**

**Challenges ahead:**

- **An excessively hot summer** is predicted this year because of the **end of the strong La Nina phase** in the equatorial Pacific Ocean.
- New forecasts suggest that **El Nino is expected to kick** in from the May-July period itself → suppressing of monsoon rainfall → **exacerbating the effects of a hot summer**.
- Heatwaves are predicted to become more intense, prolonged and frequent because of **climate change**.

**Conclusion:** The local administration needs to be vigilant and proactive and the implementation of NDMA advisories needs to be monitored by higher authorities on a daily basis.

### [Issues in same-sex marriage](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/18/issues-in-same-sex-marriage/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Mechanisms, Laws, Institutions and Bodies constituted for the Protection and Betterment of these Vulnerable Sections**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/same-sex-marriages-legal-in-india-supreme-court-petition-8559628/)

 **Context:** A five-judge Constitution Bench headed by CJI will hear a batch of petitions seeking legal recognition for [same-sex marriage.](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/20/what-is-indias-stand-on-same-sex-marriage/)

**Background:**

- The Court has been hearing multiple petitioners’ requests for **legal recognition of same-sex marriages** under the **Special Marriage Act (SMA) 1954** and making the law **gender-neutral**.
- Earlier, the court had referred the pleas to a Constitution Bench because the case involves –
    - An interplay of **constitutional rights and specific legislative enactments** including the Special Marriage Act on the one hand, and
    - **The rights of transgender couples** on the other hand.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**The issue of same-sex marriage in India**|   |
|**Arguments of petitioners**|Marriage is a social status which is bestowed by law.<br><br>**These laws do not recognise the rights of same-sex married couples** (right to adopt/have children by surrogacy, rights to inheritance, pension etc) even though the SC held that all adults have the right to marry a person of their choice.<br><br>They will not be able to avail of legally accrued benefits of laws. **For example,**<br><br>**The Transplantation of Human Organs Act** only allows near relatives to object to the use of a deceased’s body for organ donation.<br><br>**Section 80 of the IT Act 1961** provides for the deduction of certain sums for computing the total income of an assessee when such sums are paid on behalf of a spouse.<br><br>**Equality** must extend to all spheres of life – home, workplace, and public places.<br><br>Non-recognition of same-sex marriage violates rights under –<br><br>**Articles 14 (right to equality before the law),**<br><br>**15 (right against discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth),**<br><br>**19 (freedom of speech and expression), and**<br><br>**21 (protection of life and personal liberty) of the Constitution.**<br><br>Therefore, **structural changes along with attitudinal changes** are the need of the hour.<br><br>For this to happen, benefits of legislation such as the **Special Marriage Act 1954** (which provides for the solemnization of special marriages between any two persons), should be provided to same-sex couples.|
|[**Views of the Centre**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/13/same-sex-marriages-can-rock-societal-values-centre/)|Opposed the petitions and questioned their maintainability.<br><br>If the court allows same-sex marriage, it would amount to the “**judicial creation of a social institution called ‘marriage’ of a different kind than contemplated in the existing law**”.<br><br>**Only the legislature** (repository of democratic representation and reflects the will of the people) **has the right to make such changes in the law.**<br><br>**Marriage is not confined to the private sphere** – The regulation of marriage is very much an issue of acceptance by society – **This rationale** is the very basis for state recognition of marriage.|
|**Earlier SC judgments**|Lata Singh vs State of UP (2006), Shafin Jahan vs Asokan KM (2018) and Laxmibai Chandaragi B vs The State of Karnataka (2021): **An adult person has the right to marry a person of their choice under Article 21.**<br><br>**KS Puttaswamy vs Union of India (2017):** The rights of LGBTQ are inherent in the right to life, privacy and dignity. They constitute the essence of **liberty and freedom.**<br><br>**Navtej Singh Johar vs UOI (2018):** The choice of whom to partner, the ability to find fulfilment in sexual intimacies and the right not to be subjected to discriminatory behaviour are **intrinsic to the constitutional protection of sexual orientation.**|
|**Way ahead**|The [march towards same-sex marriage](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/16/sansad-tv-perspective-legalising-same-sex-marriage/) **in a diverse country like India,** with well-entrenched traditions will not be easy. Therefore, **awareness on sex, gender and constitutional rights** from the school level to change things on the ground is the need of the hour.|

### [The issue of narcotics trade](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/18/the-issue-of-narcotics-trade/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Security Challenges and their Management in Border Areas – Linkages of Organized Crime with Terrorism**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-terrorist-drug-nexus-why-drug-trafficking-is-a-serious-security-issue-8561806/)

 **Context:** The issue of [narcotics trade](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/08/17/drug-trafficking-in-india/) has kept security agencies and law enforcement agencies on the tenterhooks.

**Background:**

- **Legally speaking**, the term “narcotic” has negative connotations – narcotic drugs (such as heroin) are totally prohibited.
- **In the medical community**, the term refers to any psychoactive compound (like morphine) with numbing or paralysing properties.
- **The narcotics trade,** which is assuming dangerous proportions all over the world, is a **social problem** that harms youth and families.
- The money it generates is diverted for disruptive activities that have bearings on **national security.**

**India is no exception:**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/death_crescent.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/death_crescent.png)

- As India has been **sandwiched between** the Death (Golden) Crescent and Death (Golden) Triangle, it is being flooded with drugs, especially **heroin and methamphetamine.**
- Nearly **90% of the world’s demand** for these drugs is being met from these two regions and India is **both a big market and a transit route** for other countries.

**Challenges for India:**

- **National security challenges:**
    - The connection of drug traffickers from across borders with terrorist organisations → illegal money is used for terror activities.
    - **India has emerged as a hot destination for cocaine,** the supply of which is controlled by South American drug cartels, which have links with local drug lords, gangsters and Khalistani terrorists.
- **Porous borders:** These are under the control of terrorist/rebel groups, indirectly supported by Pakistan and China.
- **The maritime route**: Has also become very active.
- **The use of drones:** To supply drugs and weapons across the border in Punjab is a new phenomenon and law enforcement agencies are working to neutralise this.
- **Anonymity:** 62% of the darknet is being used for illicit drug trafficking. **Cryptocurrency** payments and doorstep deliveries have made darknet transactions attractive.

**Measures taken by the government:**

- **Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB):** It was constituted in 1986 under the **NDPS Act 1985** with the prime responsibility of **fighting drug trafficking and drug abuse**.
- [**Nasha Mukt Bharat Abhiyaan (NMBA)**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/06/29/nasha-mukt-bharat-annual-action-plan-2020-21/)

- The government constituted the Narco-Coordination Centre (**NCORD**) in 2016.
- [**National Fund for Control of Drug Abuse**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/10/25/national-fund-to-control-drug-abuse/)

**Achievements of Indian agencies:**

- **The Indian Coast Guard (ICG)**, in conjunction with the intelligence agencies, has been making big seizures frequently.
- **The Narcotics Control Bureau** busted an organised racket of darknet vendors and arrested several Indian nationals and their international counterparts were exposed for the first time.
- **Operation “Gear Box”** was started by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) to combat the smuggling of heroin by detecting the hidden drugs in the gear boxes.

**Way ahead:**

- **Concerted and coordinated efforts** of all the agencies will be required to tackle this growing threat.
- **Technical surveillance followed by basic policing methods** will lead to the seizure of large consignments of drugs and the arrest of the gang.
- **The nexus** between terrorists and organised gangs/underworld is a new and disturbing trend, which has to be tackled effectively by security agencies.

### [Trojan Asteroids](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/18/trojan-asteroids/)

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/nasa-lucy-jupiter-trojan-asteroids-8557461/)

**Context:** [NASA’s Lucy mission](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/lucy/overview/index/) has captured its **first images of the Jupiter and Trojan asteroids** using its high-resolution L’LORRI camera

**What are Trojan asteroids?**

Trojan asteroids are a group of asteroids that **share Jupiter’s orbit around the sun**. There are two groups of Trojan asteroids, the “**Greeks**,” which lead Jupiter in its orbit, and the “**Trojans**,” which follow behind it.

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/asteroid.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/asteroid.png)**

**Significance**: These asteroids are believed to be **ancient remnants from the early days** of the solar system, and studying them can provide insight into the formation and evolution of the planets. They hold clues to the formation of our solar system as they are gravitationally stable for billions of years.

**About Lucy mission**

The Lucy mission is a **12-year-long solar-powered mission** to study eight asteroids, covering a distance of over 6 billion km, to deepen the understanding of the “**young solar system”.** The mission is named after ‘**Lucy’** (a **3.2-million-year**-old species of **hominins**).

The mission is designed to understand the composition of the diverse asteroids that are a part of the Trojan asteroid swarms. It is the first spacecraft to be sent to study these Trojan asteroids up close.

### [Supercritical carbon dioxide](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/18/supercritical-carbon-dioxide/)

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**HBL**](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/business-tech/supercritical-carbon-dioxide-can-flush-out-oil-from-depleting-wells/article66741843.ece)

 **Context**: A new research by IIT Madras has suggested the use of Supercritical carbon dioxide to flush out oil from depleting oil and gas reservoirs.

**What is Supercritical carbon dioxide?**

It is a fluid state of **carbon dioxide where** it is held at or above its critical temperature (31∘C) and critical pressure (73 atm).

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/phase.jpg?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/phase.jpg)

**Benefits:**

- **Carbon Dioxide Sequestration:** Having properties midway between a gas and a liquid, supercritical carbon dioxide helps in simultaneous carbon dioxide sequestration
- **Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) from depleted Oil wells:** Supercritical carbon dioxide reduces oil viscosity, induces in situ swelling of the oil and thus enhances oil recovery

**Method: ‘Surfactant-Alternating gas (SAG) injection’ approach:** In this process, carbon dioxide gas is injected into the reservoir, where it becomes supercritical, followed by injection of water or surfactant solution.
