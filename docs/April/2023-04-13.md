#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Issues and Challenges Pertaining to the Federal Structure**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/row-over-nomination-of-mcd-members-sc-asks-how-l-g-can-act-without-aid-advice-of-council-of-ministers/article66721001.ece#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAccordingly%2C%20under%20the%20constitutional%20scheme,power%2C%E2%80%9D%20the%20petition%20claimed.)

 **Context:** The Supreme Court observed **how can the** [**Lieutenant Governor (L-G)**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2015/05/19/the-big-picture-chief-minister-vs-lieutenant-governor-rules-rights-and-responsibilities/) **act without aid and advice of the Council of Ministers** in nominating 10 members to the MCD.

**What was the case?**

 **The petitioner’s (Delhi govt) claims:**

- According to the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, the MCD had to include 10 people – **Aldermen** (above 25 years of age), having special knowledge/experience in municipal administration, **to be nominated by the administrator/LG.**
- According to the Constitutional scheme ([**Article 239 AA**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/14/centre-vs-delhi-govt-on-control-over-services-timeline-of-a-dispute/)) these powers were to be exercised **only under the “aid and advice” of the CoM**, except where the LG is required by law to act at their discretion.
- If there is a difference of opinion, the LG may refer the matter to the **President** and under no circumstances has any independent decision-making power.
- The nominations made by the L-G are **ultra vires** (to the Constitution and the [SC’s 2018 verdict](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/14/centre-vs-delhi-govt-on-control-over-services-timeline-of-a-dispute/)) and **illegal**.

**The LG’s claims:** An amendment to **the GNCTD Act 1991** (the Government of NCT Act) was made (whose notification is under challenge in SC) after the [SC’s 2018 judgement](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/14/centre-vs-delhi-govt-on-control-over-services-timeline-of-a-dispute/). The amendment provides for such nominations to be made by LG.

**What the SC said?** It said neither the DMC (Delhi Municipal Commission) Act nor any other provision of law says anywhere that such nomination is to be made by the administrator at his discretion.

### [Natural farming](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/13/natural-farming-2/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus****: Agriculture**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/agriculture/not-just-green-natural-farming-in-andhra-yielded-more-produce-than-conventional-methods-shows-study-88713)

 **Context:** As per a new study, [**Zero Budget Natural Farming**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/01/10/zero-budget-natural-farming-2/#:~:text=It%20is%20a%20method%20of,the%20healthy%20growth%20of%20crops.) **(ZBNF) in Andhra Pradesh** has led to significantly **higher crop yield compare**d to organic or conventional (synthetic fertilisers and pesticides) farming under the state’s **APCNF programme.**

**Findings of the study:**

- ZBNF yields were **higher than both conventional and organic treatments** in several districts in Andhra Pradesh
- **Immediate yield benefit** observed after adopting ZBNF: This helped farmers on short-term land leases, as they may not be able to farm the same land every season
- **Nutrient availability remains unaffected in ZBNF:** Previously it was thought that conventional agriculture (which uses synthetic fertilisers), increases **extractable nutrient concentrations** compared to organic and ZBNF treatments.
- If ZBNF covered **25% of the total crop area in Andhra Pradesh**, **$70 million** would be saved in fertilizer subsidies every year

**About Andhra Pradesh Community Managed Natural Farming (APCNF) programme**

It was launched in 2016, for pushing **100 per cent chemical-free agriculture**. It has worked with over 6 lakh farmers (out of a total estimated 60 lakh) in the state, on natural farming.

**Issues with conventional fertilizers**:

Intensive use of synthetic pesticides and fertilisers comes with a number of associated risks to farmers’ finances, human health, greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity loss and environmental pollution.

**Comparison between Conservation Agriculture (CA) and ZBNF:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Conservation Agriculture (CA)**|**ZBNF**|
|1.      CA is a modern farming approach that uses **low levels of external inputs and emphasizes technological solutions** for yield improvement|1.      ZBNF is an approach that emphasizes **natural farming techniques and no external inputs**|
|2.      It emphasizes the use of **cover crops and improved seeds**|2.      It places more emphasis on natural mulching and the use of indigenous seeds|
|3.      It is considered to be more cost-effective and economically viable.|3.      It has a lower ecological footprint and potentially higher carbon sequestration potential|
|Both approaches focus on soil **health, water conservation,** adoption of reduced tillage, application of crop residues and intercropping to minimise soil disturbance|   |

### [The Forest Rights Act, 2006: What makes implementation challenging](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/13/the-forest-rights-act-2006-what-makes-implementation-challenging/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Government Policies and Interventions for Development in various sectors and Issues arising out of their Design and Implementation**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/forests/estimating-the-potential-of-community-forest-rights-what-makes-implementation-challenging-88623)

**Context:** Even after 16 years, implementation provisions under the [Forest Rights Act, 2006](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/12/29/insights-into-editorial-looking-beyond-the-forest-rights-act/#:~:text=The%20Scheduled%20Tribes%20and%20Other,right%20to%20life%20and%20livelihood.), have been far from satisfactory.

**The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act 2006 (FRA)**:

[![Current Affairs](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Forest-Act.jpg?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Forest-Act.jpg)

- It recognizes the rights of forest-dwelling communities to forest resources.
- It also provides **rights to the allocation of forest land for developmental purposes** to fulfil the basic infrastructural needs of the community.
- In conjunction with the [Land Acquisition Rehabilitation and Settlement Act 2013](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2018/12/11/right-to-fair-compensation-and-transparency-in-land-acquisition-rehabilitation-and-resettlement-act-land-acquisition-act-2013/), **FRA protects the tribal population from eviction** without rehabilitation and settlement.
- **The Gram Sabha** is a highly empowered body under the Act, enabling the tribal population to have a decisive say in the determination of local policies and schemes impacting them.

**Reasons for non-implementation of FRA:**

- Lack of clarity about where and how much forest land might be eligible for **Community Forest Resource Rights** (CFRR) claims.
- Consequently, there is **no target against which the state government’s performance** can be measured.

**The potential area that could be marked for granting of CFRR in 4 states:**

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cfrr.jpg?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cfrr.jpg)**

**Why this gap?**

- The complexity of land and forest settlement in India.
- The poor quality of land records and maps available.
- A crude estimate can be made from **village land use data** provided in the census’ village amenities tables → likely to be significantly lower than the actual area → large tracts of forests being demarcated as Reserve Forest (RF) → not being part of any revenue village.

**Estimate the CFRR potential area in two parts**:

- All villages have more than 10 hectares (ha) of forest area within their revenue boundaries as per Census 2011.
- All villages that are in or adjacent to RF patches that are outside village revenue boundaries.
    - **The customary boundaries** of these villages should extend at least 2 km into the forest (to be identified using **GIS**).

**Conclusion:** The correct estimation of the CFRR potential areas will potentially benefit the livelihoods of a total of around **62.6** million people (in 4 states in the table above).

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/in-pursuit-of-a-magic-number-physicists-discover-new-uranium-isotope/article66699249.ece)

 **Context:** Recently, physicists in Japan discovered a previously unknown isotope of uranium, with atomic number 92 and mass number 241, i.e., uranium-241. Physicists were in search of a ‘magic number’.

**What is a “Magic Number”?**

In nuclear physics, “magic numbers” are **specific numbers of protons or neutrons** in atomic nuclei that correspond to **Stable configurations**. The heaviest known ‘magic’ nucleus is lead (82 protons). After this nucleus becomes unstable.

**What are Isotopes?**

Isotopes are atoms of the same element that have the same number of protons but differ in the number of neutrons in their nuclei. Isotopes of an element have nearly identical chemical properties but may differ in their physical properties such as density and radioactivity.
