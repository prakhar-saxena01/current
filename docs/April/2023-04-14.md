### [The Role of Parliamentary Committees](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/14/the-role-of-parliamentary-committees/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Parliament and State Legislatures—Structure, Functioning, Conduct of Business, Powers & Privileges and Issues Arising out of these**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/the-role-of-parliamentary-committees/article66730595.ece)

 **Context:** [Parliamentary committees](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/10/07/parliamentary-committees-their-leaders-and-their-role-in-law-making/) – panels made up of MPs – are constituted to delve deeper into matters of public concern and develop an expert opinion.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Parliamentary committees in India**|   |
|**Meaning**|A committee appointed/elected by the House or nominated by the Speaker of Lok Sabha (LS) or the Chairman of Rajya Sabha (RS) and has a secretariat provided by the LS/RS.<br><br>They work under the direction of the Speaker/Chairman, presenting their report to the House or to the Speaker/Chairman.|
|**Evolution**|**Individual committees** have been formed since independence (Ex. The Ad Hoc Committee on the Citizenship Clause). A structured committee system was established in **1993**.|
|**Legal/ constitutional backing**|Mentioned in the Constitution of India without providing specific provisions (regarding their composition, tenure, functions, etc).<br><br>These matters are dealt with by the **rules of two Houses**.|
|**Need**|Indian Parliament undertakes **a large volume of information and scale of operations** → not feasible to take up all issues on the floor of the House.<br><br>Continuous efforts are needed to make Parliament a **dynamic, functional space**.<br><br>Thus, committees are constituted to make **Parliament a dynamic space and take up sector-specific concerns.**<br><br>Behind every comment and every Bill introduced or taken up for discussion lies the **ceaseless work** of various committees.<br><br>‘It is not far from the truth to say that Congress in session is Congress on public exhibition, whilst Congress in Committee rooms is Congress at work’ (**Woodrow Wilson**)|
|**Classification**|**Standing Committees** are permanent in nature, constituted every year or periodically. They may be further classified (based on the nature of the function) –<br><br>Financial Committees (Public Accounts Committee, etc)<br><br>Departmental-related Parliamentary Standing Committees<br><br>Committees to Inquire such as the Committee on Petitions, etc<br><br>**Ad Hoc Committees** are temporary (need-based).|
|**Role**|**Go into the details of a specific piece of legislation** → analyse its potential impact on governance indicators →  then make their recommendations (not binding on the government).<br><br>**Go into issues that are crucial for nation-building** but don’t hold as much political significance. Take the example of defence shipyards.<br><br>**Ensure an oversight on the executive** → The government is required to table an ‘Action Taken’ report for the House to judge the progress made on the suggestions of the committee.<br><br>**Enable day-to-day functioning of Parliament in session:** For example, the Business Advisory Committee prepares the entire schedule of both Houses when Parliament is in session.<br><br>**Enable efficient functioning of MPs:** For example, the Committee on papers laid on the table of the House **prepares each individual paper** after careful deliberation, writing and screening.|
|**Best practice**|Work done on the **Digital Data Protection Bill** (The Puttaswamy judgement (2017) → Justice Srikrishna Committee → The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 → A Joint Parliamentary Committee → New Draft Digital Data Protection Bill, 2022)|
|**Current challenges**|Political enmity and polarization<br><br>Public proceedings of the House **do not allow for any deliberation, leaving the consensus**<br><br>**The declining trend** of national legislation being subjected to expert scrutiny.<br><br>During the course of the 17th LS, **only 14 Bills have been referred for the further examination so far**.<br><br>25% of the Bills introduced were referred to committees in the 16th LS, as compared to 71% and 60% in the 15th and 14th LS respectively.|
|**The road ahead**|The Parliament could consider **a compulsory referral** (like the US) for the Bills that are tabled on the floor.<br><br>**Arming these toothless tigers with more powers** to help them ensure accountability from the executive.<br><br>It is essential for the parliamentary ecosystem in India **to institutionalise such procedures** and not allow political considerations to hasten law-making.|

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Various Security forces and agencies and their mandate**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/inter-services-organisations-command-control-discipline-bill-2023-explain-military-defence-lok-sabha-budget-session/article66720436.ece)

 **Context:** The [**Inter-Services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Bill 2023**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/17/govt-introduces-bill-in-lok-sabha-to-strengthen-tri-services-commanders-powers/) was recently tabled in the Lok Sabha by the Ministry of Defence.

**Inter-services organisations include** Soldiers from the Army, the Air Force and the Navy, like joint training institutes –

- National Defence Academy,
- National Defence College (NDC),
- Defence Services Staff College (DSSC), and
- the Andaman and Nicobar Command (ANC).

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**The Inter-Services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Bill 2023**|   |
|**The rationale behind the proposed law**|Armed forces personnel are governed by the **provisions of three separate laws for the three services** –<br><br>the Air Force Act, 1950,<br><br>the Army Act, of 1950, and<br><br>the Navy Act, 1957<br><br>**Only an officer of the same service** (not the commander-in-chief of a joint services command/the officer-in-command of any other inter-services organisation) holds disciplinary powers over persons governed by the respective Act → **impacts command, control and discipline**.<br><br>The existing framework is **time-consuming and involves financial costs** to move the personnel → **impedes expeditious disposal of cases.**<br><br>The proposed legislation aims to address these impediments **without disturbing the unique service conditions or amending the service Acts.**|
|**Key provisions in the Bill**|Existing inter-services organisations will be deemed to have been constituted under the Bill.<br><br>The proposed legislation **seeks to empower the central government** to set up an inter-services organisation by notification.<br><br>This can include **a joint services command – a key feature of the theaterisation plan** of the armed forces. **The commander-in-chief or the officer-in-command** will be the head.<br><br>**The superintendence** of the inter-services organisation will be vested in the **Central Government.**<br><br>**All disciplinary and administrative powers** in terms of personnel (continue to be governed by their respective service Acts) will lie with the commander-in-chief, the officer-in-command, etc.<br><br>The Centre **can notify any force or part of it**, under the authority of the Government, to which the Bill will apply.|
|**Tangible benefits**|**Expeditious disposal of cases**, saving time and public money by **avoiding multiple proceedings** and **greater integration** amongst armed forces personnel.|
|**How will it affect the tri-services theaterisation plan?**|Each of the theatre commands will have units of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force.<br><br>All the units will work as **a single entity looking after security challenges** in a specified geographical territory under an operational commander.<br><br>The Bill holds the potential to ensure **better management of theatre commands** once they are operationalised.|

### [YZ Ceti b](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/14/yz-ceti-b/)

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/yz-ceti-b-exoplanet-radio-signals-magnetic-field-habitability/article66729018.ece)

 **Context****:** Astronomers have discovered a repeating radio signal from YZ Ceti b, a rocky, Earth-sized exoplanet rotating around a small red dwarf star only 12 light-years away from Earth.

**Significance**: This discovery suggests the presence of a **magnetic field around the planet**, which is one of the prerequisites for a habitable planet.

**What is a Radio signal from** [**Exo-Planets**](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/what-is-an-exoplanet/overview/#:~:text=An%20exoplanet%20is%20any%20planet,Overview)**?**

 Radio signals from planets are **electromagnetic waves** that are emitted naturally by planets in the radio frequency range. **The intensity and frequency** of the radio signals vary depending on the planet, its magnetic field, its atmosphere, and other factors.

**How Ceti b produce a radio signal?**

The radio signals detected from **YZ Ceti b** are a result of the interaction between the **planet’s magnetic field** and the star, and such signals can only be produced if the exoplanet **orbits very close to its parent star** and has its own magnetic field to influence the stellar wind and generate the signals.

**What is Exoplanet?**

 An exoplanet, also known as an extrasolar planet, is a planet that orbits a star other than our sun.

**About Red Dwarf Stars**:

Red dwarf stars are **small, low-mass, dim, and cool stars**, they are the most common and smallest in the universe. As red dwarfs are **dimmer than other stars**, it is easier to find exoplanets that surround them. Also, the **habitable zone of red dwarf stars** is closer to the star than stars like our sun, making it easier to observe potentially habitable planets
