### [Public interest immunity claims](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/11/public-interest-immunity-claims/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus****: Indian Judiciary**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/what-is-the-scs-public-interest-immunity-claim-procedure/)

 **Context:** Recently, SC set aside an order from the central government imposing a broadcast ban on the Malayalam news channel MediaOne. It has also formulated a procedure for **“public interest immunity claims”, a less restrictive alternative to ‘Sealed cover jurisprudence’** for deciding claims involving state secrets.

**What is “Sealed cover jurisprudence”?**

It refers to a **legal practice where certain sensitive documents or information** are presented to a court in a sealed envelope or cover (to **protect the confidentiality of the information**), which only the judge or authorized persons can open and view. The judge will then decide whether the information can be used as evidence, remain confidential or be disclosed.

- While a specific law **does not define the doctrine of sealed cover**, the Supreme Court derives its power to use it from Rule 7 of Order XIII of the Supreme Court Rules and **Section 123 of the Indian Evidence Act of 1872**.

**What are “public interest immunity claims”?**

It refers to situations where the **disclosure of certain information in a legal case might harm national security** or other important public interests. In such cases, the government or other parties can seek to withhold or redact such information.

**Test for “public interest immunity claims” (as given by SC):**

|   |
|---|
|**A claim involving national security considerations must be based on the test of:**|
|(i)               whether there is **material to conclude that the non-disclosure of information** is in the **interest of national security**<br><br>(ii)              whether a **reasonably prudent person** would draw the same inference from the material on record<br><br>(iii)            Even if the non-disclosure is in the **interests of national security**, the means adopted by the government should **satisfy the proportionality of action**.|

**Benefits of “public interest immunity claim” over the “sealed cover jurisprudence” for justice:**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Dimension**|**Public Interest Immunity Claim**|**Sealed Cover Jurisprudence**|
|**Standard of review**|Structured proportionality|None (so more restrictive)|
|**Impact on Principles of natural justice**|Partial|It infringes on the principles of natural justice as well as the principles of open justice- thus has a wide impact.|
|**Disclosure of information to the parties**|Yes|No, the information  remains undisclosed|
|**Safeguard of amicus curiae**|Yes- amicus curiae helps in balancing the **concerns of confidentiality** with the need to **preserve public confidence** in the objectivity of the justice delivery process.|Optional|

**What is “Structured Proportionality”?**

In simple terms, it is a standard used by courts to evaluate a case and ensure that **decisions about confidentiality are made fairly and with due consideration** for all relevant factors.

**The process of appointing an amicus curiae (“friend of the court”):**

 **The court-appointed amicus, or impartial advisor,** is allowed access to materials that the state is trying to keep confidential. The amicus can talk to the person requesting the information and their lawyer before the court hearing to understand their case and help them argue why the information should be disclosed. However, once the hearing begins and the **lawyer has seen the information, amicus cannot talk to them anymore**. The amicus must do its best to represent the interests of the person requesting the information and cannot disclose the information to anyone else.

**Conclusion:** 

The debate on Public Interest Immunity Claims and sealed covers should focus on how to **strike a balance between the public’s right to know** and the necessity to **preserve national security**.

**For more about “The SC on sealed cover jurisprudence”:** [**Click here**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/20/the-sc-on-sealed-cover-jurisprudence/)

**Article 145 of the Constitution** says that all judgments (decisions) made by the Supreme Court must be given in an open court where anyone can watch or hear. This means that the decisions cannot be made secretly.

**According to Article 145(4),** the court cannot give a judgment or report the opinions of judges in secret, it must be done openly in front of people.

**Section 123 of the Indian Evidence Act of 1872:** Under this act, official unpublished documents relating to state affairs are protected and a public officer cannot be compelled to disclose such documents.

### [Indus Water Treaty](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/11/indus-water-treaty-3/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Bilateral Agreements involving India and/or affecting India’s interests**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/water/indus-water-treaty-has-it-prevented-jammu-kashmir-from-using-their-own-resources--88689)

 **Context:** [Indus Water Treaty](https://www.insightsonindia.com/international-relations/india-and-its-neighborhood/indo-pakistan-relations/indus-water-treaty/) (IWT) seems to be struggling to gain support in the J&K region.

**Background:** 

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/indus.jpg?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/indus.jpg)

- One of the few instances of a significant international river basin conflict being resolved in South Asia is the IWT, **signed by India and Pakistan in 1960.**
- However, the J&K region’s residents claim that the **treaty prevents them from utilising their own water resources**, significantly impacting the UT’s growth.
- This indicates the **widespread resentment among the residents** over the existence of IWT.

**Reasons for resentment:** It is due to the perception that the treaty has resulted in a loss of water resources, which has had a detrimental impact on the UT’s potential for –

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Agriculture**|●       **Jammu and Kashmir’s economy** is mainly dependent on agriculture. Nearly **70%** of the people here depend on agriculture for their income, directly or indirectly.<br><br>●       **The UT’s irrigation system** has merely improved over the years. In Kashmir, the primary irrigation method (**canal**) has seen a dismal development.|
|**Power generation**|**The region’s hydropower potential**, which will give its economy a powerful boost, is not fully realised.<br><br>●       Of the potential hydropower capacity (20,000 MW), **only 3,263.46 MW/19.80%** have been used so far.<br><br>●       **IWT only allows for run-of-the-river projects** that do not affect the riparian rights of Pakistan.|

**What residents want and the steps taken:**

- Abrogation of the treaty.
- Quantify the losses incurred to aid the UT in seeking compensation.
- Consequently, the government started the process of quantifying the losses.

**Conclusion:** As the issue of IWT is again in the spotlight due to India’s appeal to Pakistan to modify it, the people of J& eagerly expect policymakers to pay attention to their concerns.

### [Building a blue economy: What India can learn from China](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/11/building-a-blue-economy-what-india-can-learn-from-china/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Economics of Animal-Rearing/Food Processing and Related Industries in India**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/building-a-blue-economy-what-india-can-learn-from-china-8547634/)

 **Context:** Like China, India must raise its own **deep-water fishing fleet** and **build modern harbours to further its economic and security goals.**

**Importance of the fishing sector for India:** 

- Fish is an **affordable and rich source of animal protein** → an option to mitigate hunger and malnutrition.
- Since Independence, India’s marine fishery has been dominated by the “**artisanal sector**” – delivering **only 2% of marine fish to the market** [98% – caught by mechanised craft].
- Commercial fishing has shown **steady growth and has become a major contributor to foreign exchange**: India – is a leading seafood exporting nation.
- Fisheries provide a **livelihood to about 15 million** fishers and fish farmers at the primary level and generate almost **twice the number of jobs** along the value chain.
- These figures could have been much higher had India invested in a **deepwater fleet,** which
    - Is an important component of the **sea power of the state**.
    - Ensures a **solution to the acute food problem** facing mankind.

**Need for a deepwater fleet for India:**

- Fishing is being undertaken in coastal waters → **Fishermen have to compete with those of neighbours**, Sri Lanka (Palk Strait) and Pakistan.
- Rich resources in **India’s EEZ remain underexploited** → catch taken away by the better-equipped fishing fleets of other Indo-Pacific countries.
- Neighbours indulging in **illegal, unregulated, and unreported (IUU)** fishing → has serious security and environmental implications.
- Fishing vessels **drifting unknowingly into foreign waters** leading to prolonged imprisonment of the crew.
- India’s fisheries exports **are at a low level of value addition**.

**Lessons to be learnt from China:**

- **It has mobilised the fishing industry** to meet the rising demand for protein and had begun distant deepwater fishing in 1985.
- With an eye on “**protein and profit”,** China **struck contracts to fish in the** EEZ of other Asian and African countries.
- Consequently, China is a “**fishery superpower**” today, owning the world’s largest deep-water fishing fleet, **with boats that stay at sea for months or even years**.
- China also uses a part of its fishing fleet as a “**maritime militia**”, which assists the navy and coast guard in their tasks.

**To evolve a long-term vision for its fishing industry, focus areas for India:**

- **Mechanisation and modernisation** of fishing vessels by providing communication links and electronic fish-detection devices.
- **Developing deep-water fishing (DWF) fleets**, with bigger, sea-going trawlers equipped with refrigeration facilities.
- **A DWF fleet around the “mothership” concept**, wherein a large vessel would accompany the fleet to provide fuel, medical and on-board preservation/processing facilities.
- **Development of modern fishing harbours** with adequate berthing and post-harvest facilities, including cold storage, preservation, and packaging of fish.

**About Tiger Census 2022**

- **Period:** Once every four years (2006, 2010, 2014, 2018)
- **Conducted by**: The National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) conducts tiger censuses in partnership with state forest departments, conservation NGOs, and the Wildlife Institute of India (WII).
- **Census methodology:**
    - **The double sampling method (introduced in 2006,** after the pugmark surveys were found to be unreliable**)** is used in the national tiger census, which involves ground-based surveys and camera-trap images.
    - **Phases 1 & 2** collected signs of tiger presence, such as scat and pugmarks.
    - **Phase 3**: the information was plotted on a forest map prepared with remote sensing and GIS. In the last phase, the data were extrapolated to areas where cameras could not be deployed.

**The 7.2 Km Kuttamperoor River in Alappuzha, Kerala** has been rejuvenated after over a 6-year effort through public participation and government intervention.

**Previously**, the River **died a slow death around 2005** due to years of waste dumping and encroachments.

**Collaborative effort:** The Major Irrigation department **removed encroachments, deepened the channel, and constructed bunds** on both sides to revive the river.

**Impact**: Its revival is expected to boost tourism in the region and help control floods.

**Other examples of successful river rejuvenation:** Rhine River (Europe); Singapore River Clean-up, Singapore; Thames River Restoration, London, UK; Ganga Action Plan, India

**Usage**: The example can be used in the environment/governance question as a successful example of River rejuvenation.

### [Changing definition of Rural-Urban areas in India](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/11/changing-definition-of-rural-urban-areas-in-india/)

**Source: ET**

 **Context:** Economic Advisory Council to the PM has suggested tweaking the [definition of rural-urban areas.](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/10/13/insights-into-editorial-redefining-cities-a-new-urban-consensus/)

**Issues with current classification:**

 Current classification uses a **combination of administrative definition and census criteria**, which are often **inadequate in capturing the speed and scale of urbanization** in India. As a result, urban areas are **often governed by panchayats**, which are less efficient in the provisioning of public goods than urban local bodies

**Suggestions:**

- The definition should be tweaked by including **technological indicators like night-time light intensity**
- Establishing a trigger mechanism to **allow automatic transition from rural to urban settlement** after the prescribed threshold is reached.
- Government should revisit the assumption of **creating schemes based on the rural-urban divide**

**Current Definition**

As of 2017, any settlement that is not considered ‘urban’ is automatically considered ‘rural’.

**Two types of urban settlements:**

- Administratively urban settlements: They are those that are governed by an **Urban Local Body (ULB).**
- **Census Urban Settlements**: They are those that have a population g**reater than 5000, 75% of the male population working in non-agriculture, and a density of 400** people per sq. Km.
