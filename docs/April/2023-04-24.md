### [Heat Dome](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/24/heat-dome/)

#### **GS Paper 1**

 **Syllabus****: Geomorphology**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/environment/what-is-heat-dome-the-phenomenon-causing-record-temperatures-across-us--88911#:~:text=A%20heat%20dome%20is%20a,flowing%20to%20rise%20and%20cool.)

 **Context:** ‘Heat domes’ have been associated with recent unusually warm periods in the USA. Previously, it had also caused [heat waves](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/08/heatwaves-in-india/) in India, Bangladesh, China and some other Asian countries.

### [Population: Boon or Bane](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/24/population-boon-or-bane/)

#### **GS Paper 1**

 **Syllabus:** **Population related issues**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/india-as-most-populous-can-be-more-boon-than-bane/article66770664.ece#:~:text=Looking%20at%20the%20population%20composition,to%20reap%20an%20economic%20dividend.) 

**Context:** According to the UNFPA State of World Population (SOWP) Report 2023, China is projected to hand over the baton of the [most populous country to India](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/07/decoding-indias-population-conundrum/#:~:text=India's%20population%20stands%20at%20412,from%201%2C412.6%20million%20in%202021).) by mid-2023.

**Highlights of the UN report:** India will have a population of **142.86 crores by mid-2023**, which is 2.9 million higher than China’s population of 142.57 crores.

**Is it a dividend or a disaster for India?** To answer this, there is a need to understand the –

**Nature of population growth, size:**

- **Population is a resource** as long as the country’s carrying capacity is intact.
- **Carrying capacity** is not just per capita availability of natural resources, it is a **dynamic concept** that changes according to changing technology, and the efficiency of the production and consumption systems of a country.

**Case of India:**

- With a total fertility rate of **2.****0 in 2023**, India is already at **replacement level fertility**, meaning two children replacing their parents.
- This indicates that the population is on a path toward **stabilisation –** experiencing positive growth (in a decelerated mode) until 2064 and then will become **negative growth**.
- The peak of India’s population size will be around **169.****6 crore in 2063.**

**Age composition of the population:** It talks about the **number of the working age population** (15-64 years) against the **dependent population** (0-14 years and 65 years and above).

**Case of India:**

- There are greater prospects for [demographic dividend](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Reaping-Indias-demographic-dividend.pdf) than a disaster.
- **With 68%** of the working age population in 2023, the country continues to have a **demographic window of opportunity for the next 35 years** to reap an economic dividend.
- A demographic window of opportunity **in itself will not automatically turn into an economic dividend**.

**Mechanisms through which a country translates demographic bonus into economic dividend:**

- **Employment or job creation**: If India is able to generate sufficient and quality jobs for its bulging working age population.
- **Education, skills generation and ensuring a healthy lifespan**: It is critical not only for better productivity but it also reduces excessive public spending and helps in greater capital creation.
- [**Good governance**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/governance/governance-important-aspects/good-governance/)**:** Reflected through conscientious policies, it will help in creating a healthy environment for increasing efficiency and productivity of the population.

**Opportunities for India:**

- **Declining and ageing population** in Japan, China, the US and other major economies.
    - Potential to become **a worldwide market for both production and consumption**, with lower manufacturing costs due to a relatively cheaper workforce.
    - This is very much evident in **India’s IT sector.**
- **Potential to boost per capita GDP** by an additional **43% by 2061**, provided the socio-economic and political enabling environment is conducive.

**Challenges:**

- **Drastic population control methods** run the risk of inducing forced population ageing.
    - **A** [**total fertility rate of less**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/09/17/the-consequences-of-declining-fertility-are-many/#:~:text=India%3A,is%202.159%20births%20per%20woman) **than 8** may not be **economically beneficial** for India. Once fertility tends to decline, it is hard to reverse it.
- What the country needs are **policies** that support an enabling environment that can provide high-quality education, healthcare, employment, infrastructure, and gender empowerment.
    - If India falls short in this, its “[demographic dividend](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/08/12/sansad-tv-the-global-debate-demographic-imbalance/)” can become a “demographic disaster”.

 **Conclusion:** Opportunities and costs are the **two sides of the coin** when it comes to being the world’s largest populous country. However, the relatively younger population of India provides **higher support ratios.**

### [Development in India’s northeast region](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/24/development-in-indias-northeast-region/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Government policies and interventions for development in various sectors and issues arising out of their design and implementation**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/a-new-troika-for-indias-northeast-region/article66770821.ece)

 **Context:** The region comprising **India’s** [**eight north-eastern States**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/08/16/editorial-analysis-the-fragility-of-the-northeasts-integration/) is undergoing dramatic change.

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/north_east.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/north_east.png)

**Dramatic changes witnessed by the region:**

- It has overcome several (but not all) **security challenges** and is now heading toward **economic development**.
- **Political changes** and the **extensive web of linkages with neighbouring Bangladesh**.
- **Japan** has emerged as a significant development partner for both India (particularly in the NE region) and Bangladesh.

**Opportunity:** Bringing the **troika** of Bangladesh, India and Japan closer for producing path-breaking changes in the northeast.

**Vision:** The long-term vision is for Bangladesh and the northeast to become **a hub and key industrial corridor of this region**, serving a population of 220 million.

**Efforts made to realise this vision:**

- **The third India-Japan Intellectual Dialogue** hosted by the Asian Confluence (ASCON), in Agartala, Tripura, assessed the evolving thinking of experts and policymakers.
- **The Matarbari Deep Sea Port** (DSP) on the southeastern coast of Bangladesh is being constructed with Japanese assistance.
    - To be operational in 2027, **the port will have to cater to the needs of Bangladesh and India’s northeast** and one of the most important projects representing the troika**.**

**The competitive advantage of the NE region:**

- Blessed with **vast natural resources.**
- **Its strategic location**, sharing borders with Nepal, Bhutan, China, Bangladesh and Myanmar, is an asset.
- **The population**, with its good education, already excels in the services sector drawing potential investor attention.

**The challenges:**

- **Japan as a single investor** in the northeast is unworkable.
- Restrictions on the flow of investments from Bangladesh.
- Little attention seems to be paid to the [**BIMSTEC**.](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/06/08/insights-editorial-analysis-a-silver-moment-to-propel-a-bay-of-bengal-dream/) This must change to progress towards the vision of establishing the **Bay of Bengal Community (BOBC).**

**Way ahead:**

- **A joint focus on comprehensive connectivity and accelerating industrialisation** in Bangladesh and the NE is accompanied by **job opportunities.**
- **The creation of regional industrial value chains** in the sectors where the NE enjoys competitive advantage (agro-processing, man-made fibres, handicrafts, etc) will ensure that the **new connectivity links will be fully utilised and productive.**
- **Expanding policy convergence** and taking people along.
- The goal should be to connect a large part of **South Asia with Southeast Asia.**
- Also, India can assist Bangladesh in becoming an integral part of the **Act East Policy**.

**Conclusion:** The leadership from the triad of Bangladesh, India and Japan (BIJ) can come together and launch a BIJ Forum at the level of Foreign Ministers first.

 **Context:** The Kerala government has **operationalised 726** [**artificial intelligence**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Artificial-Intelligence.pdf) **(AI)-enabled** surveillance cameras to detect traffic rule violations and road accidents.

According to the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, Government of India, there were over **4.5 lakh** road accidents in India in 2019, which resulted in over **1.5** deaths. Kerala was **ranked fifth** in terms of the total number of road accidents.

**About Motor Vehicles Department’s Safe Kerala Project:**

It is part of the **government’s efforts to reduce the number of** [**road accidents**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/07/sc-directs-the-committee-to-build-a-framework-to-ensure-road-safety/) in the state.

The project is being implemented with the help of **various technological advancements, including artificial intelligence (AI),** to curb traffic rule violations and reduce road accidents.

**AI use for Road Safety:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**AI Application**|**Description**|
|[**Autonomous Vehicles**](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/autonomous-drivings-future-convenient-and-connected)|Self-driving cars that use AI to analyse sensor data and make decisions about acceleration, braking, and steering in real-time, thus reducing the risk of **human error causing accidents**.|
|**Computer Vision**|AI algorithms can **alert drivers to potential hazards** such as pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles.|
|**Predictive Analytics**|AI algorithms that **analyse data on driver behaviour, road conditions, and weather** can predict potential hazards and provide warnings or suggestions to drivers.|
|**Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)**|AI can be used to **optimize traffic flow, manage congestion, and reduce the risk of accidents**.|
|**Driver Assistance Systems**|AI algorithms that monitor driver behaviour can detect signs of **fatigue, distraction, or impaired driving and provide warnings** or take control of the vehicle to prevent accidents.|
|**Road Condition Monitoring**|E.g., the ‘**Intelligent Solutions for Road Safety through Technology and Engineering (iRASTE) project** at Nagpur will identify potential accident-causing scenarios while driving a vehicle and alert drivers|

**Concerns:**

AI technology can improve road safety, but concerns need to be addressed. These include **privacy violations, accuracy issues, cost, bias, dependence on technology, and a lack of transparency**, which could lead to unfair penalties and a lack of human oversight.

**Conclusion:**

It’s important to address these concerns and ensure that the use of AI for road safety is done in a responsible and ethical manner, with appropriate safeguards in place to protect individuals’ rights and safety.
