### [Marriage break-ups: Trends and implications](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/19/marriage-break-ups-trends-and-implications/)

#### **GS Paper 1**

 **Syllabus:** **Salient Features of Indian Society**

**Source:** [**LM**](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/the-changing-landscape-of-marriage-and-divorce-a-gendered-perspective-on-global-trends-and-societal-attitudes-marriage-divorce-genderequality-familyfriendlypolicies-globaltrends-11681750640868.html)

 **Context:** Many societies worldwide still uphold the belief that ‘marriages are made in heaven’ and its violation is taken as sacrilege, a social evil.

**What is Marriage?**

The institution of marriage is a **socially and legally recognized union between two people** that establishes rights and obligations between them and their families. It is a universal human institution found in almost every culture and society

**Global marriage patterns:**

- The UN recorded a doubling of the proportion of adults (in the 35-39 age group) getting divorced or separated **from 2% in the 1970s to 4% in the 2000s.**
    - This was partly reflective of the **changes in expectations within marriages with the women entering the workforce.**
- According to OECD, **a mixed trend is witnessed** as this proportion has increased in 18 countries (like the US) and reduced in 12.

**Trends in India:**

- **93% of married Indians** (among those surveyed in 2018) had ‘an arranged marriage’, as against the global average of about 55%.
- **The annual divorce rate in India** is (low) at **1.1** per 1,000 people annually. This means, of every 1,000 Indian marriages, only 13 result in divorce.

**What compels Indian women to ‘adjust’ to bad marriages?**

- **Divorce is initiated by men**, as prevailing social norms discourage women from exercising this right.
- **Indian legal framework** is described (by feminists) “as benevolent patriarchal patronage at its best”. Hence, **women encounter legal hassles and socio-economic isolation.**
- The low labour-force participation rate of Indian women translates to **high levels of financial dependency**.

**The vicious cycle of financial dependency:** There is clear misogyny in the matrimonial market in India → **Employed women received 15% fewer responses.**

**Gendered consequences of divorce on socio-economic, domestic, health, and other aspects of life:**

- **Women** face chronic strains (whereas men face transient impacts) of divorces, as they suffer from
    - Disproportionate losses in household income,
    - Higher risk of losing homeownership,
    - Lower chances of re-partnering and also bearing the greater responsibilities of single parenting.
    - **This furthers the gender gap in the standard of living.**
- **Men** tend to be more vulnerable to **health declines, mortality and emotional damage** (often face a challenge in maintaining contact with their children).

**Whether an increasing divorce rate is a sign of women’s social progress and society maturing?**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Yes**|**No**|
|**Loosen the hold of patriarchy,** as divorces are considered a challenge to patriarchal power.<br><br>**Mauritanian society** celebrates a woman’s divorce and women lead a new life **free of any stigma of a failed relationship.** Such a societal attitude **indicates a shift in the ideas of family and marriage**.<br><br>**A business opportunity** for the increased demand it creates for homes and household products.|**A debilitating factor in societal stability**, given the adverse economic and socio-psychological fallout on divorced parents and their children.|

**Way ahead:**

- **UN Women** has urged all nations to adopt **family-friendly policies and workplace regulations** (like Germany) that enable women and men to combine caregiving with paid work.
- The institution of marriage, as a basic social unit, **should be strengthened** for the well-being of families.
    - For this, **the basic education system should foster equal partnership** as a foundational value in marriage.

### [India’s civil society organisations](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/19/indias-civil-society-organisations/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Development Processes and the Development Industry – the Role of NGOs**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/the-future-of-indias-civil-society-organisations/article66752527.ece)

 **Context:** The ability of civil society organisations (CSO) or movements to shape policy and public discourse in India has shrunk drastically.

**CSOs:**

- These are **non-State, not-for-profit, voluntary entities** formed by people in the social sphere that are separate from the State and the market.
- They represent a wide range of interests and ties and can include community-based organisations as well as non-governmental organisations (NGOs).

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/civil_society.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/civil_society.png)

**Why and how CSOs in India are curbed?**

- Seen as the new frontier for **war, and foreign interference** and vilified as **disruptive to India’s development trajectory and therefore anti-national.**
- **Imposing financial and structural constraints by**
    - Cancelling FCRA clearances,
    - Revoking licences,
    - Imposing retrospective taxes, and
    - Pressuring private companies and philanthropists to redirect funding.
- Activists, journalists, academics and students have been targeted by the **state’s governing instruments and non-state actors** (spreading violence and abuse – online and offline).

**Impact of these restrictions on CSOs:**

- **Existential threats are** faced by civil society actors as their **constitutional and civic freedoms are curtailed.**
- **Migrate to safer avenues**/ limit the scope of their work/ re-align with the govt.
- **This a grave threat to the system’s integrity** because civil society is an indispensable safety valve (fixing accountability) for tensions in a polity.
- **Unable to speak truth/amplify the voices** of the most vulnerable, enrich policies/legislation through constructive feedback.
- **Unable to further the collective good** – not in the national interest.
- Young activists could be inducted into political parties → **could create an institutionalised moral force within the parties** → balance electoral compulsions with ethical/human rights considerations.

**New trends:**

- **The emergence of govt-backed CSOs:** Termed as ‘New Civil Society for New India’, such CSOs are the principal beneficiary of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds, and have access to and influence over select departments in governments.
- **Implications:**
    - A profound influence on the welfare activities, human rights and freedoms **shaped by the CSO’s ideological imperatives**, altering the civil society landscape in India.
    - All other CSOs/movements are slowly being **circumscribed**.

**Challenges faced by CSOs:**

- **Less flexible** in reorienting their normative and operational methodologies.
- **Still clinging to outdated tactics**. **For example**, protests at Jantar Mantar undoubtedly bring activists together but they do less to shape the thinking or action of governments.
- Similarly, **articles/papers, and speeches** at think tanks/conferences/symposiums do not affect governments into any substantive course correction.
- **Even lobbying legislators** to raise issues is ineffective as the political parties do not let Parliament function.
- **Fails to blend socio-cultural values** with welfare/constructive work or calls to protect constitutional values.
- Consequently, they are **unable to guide mass consciousness**.

**Way forward for progressive civil society in India:**

- Realignment is needed by finding structural solutions to structural problems.
- **Learning from the Gandhian constructive movement**, which complemented the Congress system – an electoral and governance machine.
- **CSOs will need to urgently collaborate** with other progressive stakeholders.
- **Private philanthropies and companies** need to realise that they are the only lifeline for progressive CSOs today.

**Conclusion:** The inaction today will directly contribute to the extinction of civil society – **the fifth pillar of Indian democracy**. Therefore, by devising new methods of principled coalition we can safeguard and eventually further the constitutional idea of India.

### [Use of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/19/use-of-artificial-intelligence-in-medicine/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus: Science and Technology**

**Source:** [**PIB**](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1917670)**,** [**BBC**](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65260592) 

**Context:** The Ministry of Ayush in India is leading an effort to integrate traditional medicine with artificial intelligence (AI) through the Ayush Grid, a comprehensive IT backbone for the traditional medicine sector.

**What is Artificial Intelligence?**

 Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to **computer programs that can learn from and make decisions based on data**. These programs are designed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as recognizing patterns, analysing images, and making predictions.

**How can AI be used in Medicine?**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Use Case**|**Example**|
|**Diagnostics**|Using machine learning algorithms to analyse medical images and predict the likelihood of certain conditions, such as cancer or heart disease|
|**Drug Discovery**|Using **natural language processing algorithms** to analyse scientific papers and identify potential drug targets e.g., a vaccine against COVID-19|
|**Clinical Decision Support**|To analyse patient data and recommend the most effective treatments based on the patient’s medical history|
|**Telemedicine**|**Using chatbots or virtual assistants** to provide patients with personalized medical advice and support|
|**Predictive Analytics**|To analyse patient data and predict the likelihood of certain outcomes, such as hospital readmissions or disease progression|
|**Robotic Surgery**|To control robotic surgical instruments and improve surgical precision|
|**Personalised Medicine**|**E.g., Israeli health-tech firm Genetika+** is using stem cell technology and artificial intelligence (AI) software to match antidepressants to patients and minimise side effects.|
|**Traditional Medicine**|**E.g., The Ayush Grid** aims to transform the Ayush sector using AI to provide efficient, holistic, affordable, and quality services to all through a secure and interoperable digital ecosystem|

**Issues with the use of AI in Medicine:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Issue**|**Example**|
|**Lack of Diversity in Data**|E.g., an algorithm trained only on data from white male patients may not perform well on women or people of colour.|
|**Bias in Data**|E.g., an algorithm trained on data that includes racial biases may end up perpetuating those biases.|
|**Safety and Reliability**|AI algorithms must be reliable and safe for use in healthcare settings.|
|**Interpretability**|It is often difficult to interpret how an AI algorithm arrived at its decision. This is known as the **“black box” problem**. In medical settings, this can be a concern because doctors need to **understand the reasoning behind a diagnosis** or treatment recommendation.|
|**Privacy and Security**|AI algorithms must be designed with privacy and security in mind to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure of patient information.|

**The government programme for the promotion of AI in Healthcare:**

- Ayushman Bharat Digital India Mission
- IndiGen Programme (for genome sequencing of Indians)
- Human Genome Project
- Health Stack
- **ICMR guideline of use of AI in Healthcare**
- AIRAWAT (AI Research, Analytics and Knowledge Assimilation platform): India’s first AI-specific cloud computing infrastructure

**Conclusion:**

Despite the challenges, the future of AI in medicine looks promising, and with continued research and development, we can expect to see even more innovative and effective applications of AI in healthcare in the years to come.

**About Ayush Grid:**

AYUSH Grid (by Ministry of AYUSH) aims to **bring on onboard all AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy) facilities** including hospitals and laboratories and to promote traditional systems of healthcare.

 **Context:** **World Trade Organization (WTO)** panel has ruled that **India has violated global trading** rules by imposing import duties on IT products, such as mobile phones and components, and integrated circuits.

**Background of the dispute:**

India had introduced import duties of **between 7.5% and 20% for IT products- mobile, components, and ICs**. In 2019, the European Union (EU), Japan, and Taiwan filed complaints with the World Trade Organization (WTO), arguing that **India’s import duties violated global trading rules** and exceeded the maximum rate allowed.

**WTO recommendation:**

The WTO panel recommended that India should **bring the measures into conformity with its obligations**. India has already brought some of the **challenged tariffs into line with global trading rules** since last year.

**What next?**

If India appeals the ruling, the case will remain in legal limbo since the WTO’s top appeals bench is not functioning due to the US’s opposition to judge appointments.

**About WTO Dispute Settlement System (DSS):** There are two main ways to settle a dispute once a complaint has been filed in WTO—Mutually agreed solution and through adjudication (through the implementation of the panel—legally binding)

- The appeal to the order is held at the **Appellate Body** (currently dysfunctional). Another mechanism for appeal is

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/world/food-race-these-space-seeds-can-help-grow-climate-resilient-crops-88805)

**Context:** The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) had sent two varieties of seeds, **arabidopsis and sorghum**, to space to make them **climate-tolerant by exposing them to harsher surroundings**.

**About:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
||**Details**|
|**Positive impact of solar radiation on plants**|Exposure to increased solar radiation can **cause genetic changes in plant seeds**, which can potentially make them more resilient and adaptable to harsh environmental conditions such as drought, high temperatures, and soil salinity. This adaptation process is known as space **mutagenesis**.|
|**Negative impact**|Excessive exposure to solar radiation can be harmful to plant seeds, leading to genetic mutations that may be deleterious or even lethal.|
|**How will the study work?**|By accelerating the **natural genetic adaptation of crops** through space mutagenesis, scientists may be able to create new and improved plant varieties that can thrive in the face of increasing environmental stresses.|
|**About Sorghum**|Sorghum is a cereal grain that is grown for both human consumption and animal feed. Sorghum is a **versatile crop that can grow in a wide range of environmental conditions**, from drought-prone areas to more humid regions.|
|**About Arabidopsis**|**It** is a small flowering plant that belongs to the **mustard family (Brassicaceae).** It is widely used as a model organism in plant biology research due to its small size, rapid life cycle, and easily manipulable genetics.|

**More about it:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Topic**|**Information**|
|**Previous reports**|Steel Ministry had alerted the Odisha Government (November 2022) about the **under-reporting of grades of chromite and manganese** ores. Also, the **M. B. Shah Commission report on Illegal Mining** had probed into the issue of irregularities in the mineral sector in the past, which put the extent of loss at ₹59,000 crores.|
|**Mines and Minerals Regulation and Development Act 1957**|Empowers **state government to make rules for preventing illegal mining, transportation, and storage of minerals**. It is the responsibility of State Governments to establish the correct grade of mineral being dispatched.|
|**Mining resources in Odisha**|Odisha is a mineral-rich state with over **96% of India’s chrome ore**, over **51% of bauxite reserve**, over **33% of hematite iron** ore, and over **43% of manganese**.|
|**About Manganese**|Manganese is a **silvery-Gray metal** that is found in abundance in the Earth’s crust. It is commonly used in the **production of steel and other alloys** due to its ability to improve the strength, toughness, and workability of these materials.|
|**About IBM**|**Indian Bureau of Mines (est. 1948; HQ: Nagpur)** promotes the systematic and scientific development of mineral resources of the country both onshore and offshore. It collects a **database of information on mines and minerals** in the country to create a National Mineral Information Repository.|
