### [Japan’s New Plan for a Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/03/japans-new-plan-for-a-free-and-open-indo-pacific-foip/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus:** **International Relations**

 **Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/no-sayonara-for-japan-in-indo-pacific-geopolitics/article66692354.ece)

 **Context:** During his visit to India, the Japanese PM unveiled Japan’s New Plan for a [FOIP](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/24/india-japan-relations/) and exchanged views about deepening the Japan-India Special Strategic and Global Partnership.

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/indo.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/indo.png)**

**Japan’s New Plan for the FOIP:** It lays stress on the need to **uphold the rules-based order** and respect each other’s **territorial sovereignty,** at a time when the **international community is at a historical turning point.**

**Four pillars of cooperation under the new FOIP**:

- **Principles for peace and rules for prosperity:** Japan wants to engage in economic development programmes such as the G-20 Principles for “Quality Infrastructure Investment”.
- **Addressing challenges in an Indo-Pacific way:** Incorporating realistic and practical projects in a wide range of areas, such as **climate change, food security, global health and cybersecurity.**
- **Multi-layered connectivity:** The 3 areas identified for introducing more such projects are Southeast Asia, South Asia and the South Pacific/Pacific Island countries. Japan has made a new commitment of –
    - $100 million towards the **Japan-ASEAN Integration Fund;**
    - It will promote the **Bay of Bengal-Northeast India industrial value chain** concept in cooperation with India and Bangladesh, etc.
- **Extending efforts for security and safe use of the “sea” to the “air”:** Japan will help in strengthening the capabilities of maritime law enforcement agencies in other countries. Towards these objectives,
    - Japan will implement the “strategic use of Official Development Assistance (ODAs)”.
    - Japan also announced **to mobilise a total of more than $75 billion in public and private funds** by 2030 for infrastructure development.

**What does Japan’s New Plan for the FOIP signify?**

- **Japan needs to do much more in the region**.
- Japan is preparing itself for any unforeseen threat to its own as well as regional security.
- To reinforce the idea that Japan has been the
    - **The main champion of the FOIP concept**
    - **Central in the emerging geopolitics** of the Indo-Pacific
- With recent global developments (Russia-Ukraine war, Chinese assertiveness in the SCS, ECS, the Indian LAC, and the Taiwan Straits), **there is a need to give a fresh push and momentum to the FOIP concept**.
- It focuses on the numerous challenges facing the Indo-Pacific such as the **lack of a united stand** on “what the international order should be?”.

**Pros of FOIP:** Embrace diverse voices and **create an atmosphere of cooperation and collaboration** (rather than division and confrontation) → **rule-making through dialogue**.

[**India and Japan relations:**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/24/india-japan-relations/)

- Notwithstanding some differences in the Ukraine conflict, **Japan remains one of India’s closest friends in Asia** given their **shared concerns over the aggressive Chinese activities**.
- Japan deeply invested in Indo-Pacific stability and prosperity is **good news indeed for India and the wider region.**

**India and FOIP:**

- India is an **indispensable**
- Japan’s concept of FOIP is like [**India’s concept of the Indo-Pacific**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/05/20/sansad-tv-perspective-indias-indo-pacific-vision/) **Oceans Initiative** (IPOI), which has seven pillars:
    - Maritime Security;
    - Maritime Ecology;
    - Maritime Resources;
    - Capacity Building and Resource Sharing;
    - Disaster Risk Reduction and Management;
    - Science, Technology and Academic Cooperation; and
    - Trade Connectivity and Maritime Transport.

**Conclusion:** Both India and Japan should cooperate to build consensus on the new FOIP during the G-7 and the G-20 (Japan and India hold their presidencies, respectively) summits.

### [National Electricity Plan for 2022-27](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/03/national-electricity-plan-for-2022-27/)

#### **GS Paper 3** 

**Syllabus:** **Infrastructure (Energy)**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/business/commodities/coal-fired-projects-back-on-mega-lithium-battery-storage-push-in-new-power-policy-blueprint-8532812/)

 **Context:** A new blueprint for the country’s power sector planners – the **National Electricity Plan for 2022-27** – marks a discernible reversal in the policy.

**The National Electricity Plan:**

- The **Central Electricity Authority (CEA)** must create a National Electricity Plan in line with the [National Electricity Policy](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/05/10/insights-into-editorial-what-is-missing-in-the-draft-national-electricity-policy/), according to the **Electricity Act 2003,** to –
    - Create short-term (every 5-year) and perspective plans (15 years)
    - Analyse the need for planning capacity expansion
    - Coordinate the efforts of different planning agencies to ensure that resources are used **optimally**
    - Support the needs of the country’s economy.
- The 1st National Electricity Plan was published in 2007, the 2nd in 2013, and **the third (2018)** includes the detailed Plan for 2017–22 and the perspective Plan for 2022–27.

**Key takeaways from the National Electricity Plan for 2022-27:**

- The fresh draft notes the need for an **additional coal-based capacity** of 28 GW by 2031-32, in addition to the 25 GW of coal-based capacity that is currently being built.
    - A rise in the coal-fired power plants’ **plant load factor (PLF)**, from 55% in 2026-27 to 62% in 2031-32.
    - **This is an obvious admission of the ground realities.**
- **A predicted 51 GW to 84 GW battery storage** need with a daily usage rate of 5 hours in a push for renewable energy by 2031-32.
    - Estimated at Rs. 10 crores per MW, this could equate to between Rs. 5 to 8 lakh crore in battery storage investments.

**What marks a discernible reversal?** The focus earlier was **almost entirely on renewable energy** for incremental capacity addition and fresh **coal-fired capacity was virtually ruled out.**

**Concerns:**

- **Continued reliance on old technology, and inflexible coal**–**fired** plants for base load capacity → do not promise robust reliability. **For example,** coal-fired thermal power plants of 200 MW series in India are more than 25 years old.
- **Uncertainty** regarding the management of the renewables-dominated grid infrastructure. **For example,** due to hydropower’s and zero-inertia solar generators’ slow development, the inertia that provides stability to the grid has been decreasing.
- **There is no evaluation** of the ramping rate for thermal plants under different solar generation scenarios.
- **There is inadequate funding for the development of battery storage**.

**Way ahead (as per the National Electricity Plan for 2022-27):**

- **Battery Energy Storage systems (BESS) based on Lithium-ion batteries:**
- Advantages → **cost-effective, balance the grid** against load fluctuations/intermittency in generation → energy storage can provide energy time-shifting.
- **The hybrid generation models:** This will enable a shift to solar energy and provide backup power.
- **The water-based systems:** In these systems water is raised to the reservoir during charging, and when it is discharged, it produces energy.
    - **The closed water cycle has a 70% water cycle efficacy and 6% evaporation loss.**
    - They are economical as no barrage on the river is required.

### [Microplastic Pollution](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/03/microplastic-pollution/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus****: Environment – Pollution**

**Source:** [**Indian Express**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/170-trillion-plastic-new-study-impact-8533894/#:~:text=An%20estimated%20170%20trillion%20plastic,could%20nearly%20triple%20by%202040.)

 **Context**: According to a new study, an estimated **170 trillion plastic particles weighing about 2 million metric tons are currently afloat in the oceans** across the world, and if no urgent action is taken then **this number could nearly triple by 2040.**

**About Microplastics:**

- [Microplastics](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/07/23/microplastics-in-ganga/) are defined as **synthetic solid particles** sized ranging from **1 micrometre to 5 millimetres (mm),** which are insoluble in water.
- They are **particularly harmful** to the oceans as they **don’t readily break down into harmless molecules and adversely affect the health of marine organisms**, which mistake plastic for food.

**Key findings of the new study:**

- They found that from **1990 to 2005, the number of plastic particles more or less fluctuated** due to the **effective implementation of important policy measures** like [**MARPOL Annex 5**](https://www.imo.org/en/ourwork/environment/pages/garbage-default.aspx) **which enforced laws against dumping trash at sea.**
- **The concentration of plastic particles including microplastics in the ocean has skyrocketed in the oceans since the mid-2000s**, and it continues to increase.
- If the **world fails to take any drastic action about the issue, there will be a 2.6-fold increase in plastic flowing into aquatic environments by 2040.**

**How do microplastics impact the oceans and marine life?**

- Mechanical problems, such as **lacerations and blockages to internal systems** of organisms.
- Ingested plastics can **cause chemical problems by leaching absorb chemicals into organisms.**
- Microplastics **absorb many hydrophobic compounds, like DDT, PCBs and other industrial chemicals**, and evidence shows they can be released when ingested.
- Microplastics can also **disrupt the carbon cycle of the oceans**.

**What can be done to limit** [**plastic pollution**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2018/03/29/insights-into-editorial-in-a-plastics-world/) **in oceans?**

- There is an **urgent need to implement a global resolution to limit the production of single-use, throwaway plastic.**
- Need to **reduce the number of chemical additives in new plastic products.**

**Initiatives Taken to tackle microplastics:**

**Global Initiatives:**

- [**Global Partnership on Marine Litter (GPML)**](https://www.unep.org/explore-topics/oceans-seas/what-we-do/addressing-land-based-pollution/global-partnership-plastic)
- **GloLitter Partnerships Project**
- [London Convention, 1972](https://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Environment/Pages/London-Convention-Protocol.aspx)

**India-Specific Initiatives:**

- Elimination of Single Use Plastic
- [Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/08/16/plastic-waste-management-amendment-rules-2021/)

|---|---|
|**About Rare diseases**|**Information**|
|**Definition**|**A rare disease (also called “Orphan” disease)** is a condition that affects a small number of people compared to the general population— one or less than one **per 1000 people (WHO); one or less than one in 2500 (India definition)**. There are **7,000 known rare diseases** ( over 72% of them are genetic) with an estimated 300 million patients in the world.|
|**Examples**|lysosomal storage disorder, maple syrup urine disease, Severe food protein allergy, Wilson’s disease|
|**Benefits of exemption**|The exemption will lead to **substantial savings for patients** with rare diseases, who are often unable to afford life-saving medicines due to prohibitive costs|
|**Process**|People importing them have to **obtain a certificate from the central or state director general of health services** or district medical officer or civil surgeon. These certificates have to be provided to the customs officers at the time of clearance.|
|**Challenges of rare diseases**|Patients with rare diseases are disadvantaged by the **lack of volumes** that usually spur pharmacological companies into producing life-saving medicines|
|**The magnitude of rare diseases in India**|An estimated **100 million people in India have some form of rare diseases**|
|[**National Policy for Rare Diseases (NPRD), 2021**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/04/03/national-policy-for-rare-diseases-2021/)|**Group 1:** Disorders amenable to one-time curative treatment (financial support of up to Rs. 20 lakh under the umbrella scheme of Rashtriya Arogya Nidhi)<br><br>**Group 2:** Those requiring long-term or lifelong treatment.<br><br>**Group 3:** Diseases for which definitive treatment is available but challenges are to make an optimal patient selection for benefit, very high cost and lifelong therapy.|
