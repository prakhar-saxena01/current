### [Defamation law](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/04/defamation-law/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Indian Constitution—Historical Underpinnings, Evolution, Features, Amendments, Significant Provisions and Basic Structure**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/a-blow-against-free-speech/article14321176.ece1)

**Context:** The [defamation law](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/08/06/what-is-defamation/#:~:text=Defamation%20is%20the%20communication%20of,government%2C%20religion%2C%20or%20nation.) in India has come under scrutiny once again following the conviction of a Congress leader (Rahul Gandhi) in a 2019 defamation case.

**Background:** In **1860**, the British imported their idea of criminal defamation into the newly-minted **Section 499** of the **Indian Penal Code (IPC)**.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Defamation – Meaning (Section 499)**|A person is said to be defamed when someone makes or publishes any accusations about them with the intent of damaging their image through words, signs, or other visible representations.|   |
|**Types – Civil and Criminal:**|In **civil defamation**, a person who is defamed can move either HC or subordinate courts and seek damages in the form of **monetary compensation**.|In **criminal defamation (Section 500),** the person against whom a defamation case is filed might be sentenced to **two years imprisonment or fined or both**.|

**The law of defamation and right to free speech [Article 19 (1)(a)]:**

- **Exceptions** to defamation: **Absolute truth and what is for the public good.**
- **The criminality of defamation** was challenged in the SC on the grounds that it was an **unreasonable restriction** on the constitutionally-guaranteed **right to freedom of speech and expression.**
- However, **the apex court upheld the British-era Section** (**Subramanian Swamy V. The Union of India 2016).**

**Analysing the 2016 SC verdict:**

**Article 21 vs 19 (1)(a):**

- The court held that **the right to “reputation”** was protected under **Article 21** of the Constitution which guarantees “life and personal liberty”.
- The right under Article 19(1)(a) **had to be “balanced” against the right to “reputation”** under Article 21.
- Thus, the **court elevated “reputation”** to the level of a **fundamental right** and made it **prevail over free speech**.
- Over the years, the court has expanded the scope of Article 21 **to force the state to undertake various “social justice” measures.**
- But in this case, the **SC used Article 21 as a sword to cut down the fundamental right** to freedom of speech and expression (“death by Article 21”).

**Invoking ‘constitutional fraternity’:**

- The court held that **criminal defamation law protected the feeling of fraternity** (mentioned in the preamble as an aspirational goal alongside “liberty” and “equality”)/**solidarity** between members of society.
- However, “constitutional fraternity” is **not a part of Article 19(2)**, which specifically limits the circumstances under which the state can restrict speech.
- **“Liberty cannot be divorced from equality; equality cannot be divorced from liberty. Nor can liberty and equality be divorced from fraternity.” (B.R. Ambedkar)**

**Issues with the court’s verdict:**

- No mention of the fact that Section 499 does not allow for “**honest mistake**” as a defence.
    - The SC (previously) had found the **civil law of defamation unconstitutional/disproportionate** restriction upon free speech since it did not allow for “honest mistake”.
- **Dismissal** of the claim that criminal defamation creates a **chilling effect upon speech**.
- The SC has always had an **ambivalent relationship** with the freedom of speech and expression.

**Conclusion:** The court had to construct novel arguments which will have serious and unfortunate implications for the freedom of speech and expression in the coming years.

### [Monetary policy’s impact on inequality](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/04/monetary-policys-impact-on-inequality/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** Indian Economy and issues relating to Planning, Mobilization of Resources, Growth, Development and Employment

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/explainspeaking-monetary-policys-impact-on-inequality-8535008/)

 **Context:** Over the course of the next four days, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of RBI will deliberate whether interest rates should be hiked further or not.

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IRB.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IRB.png)

**Background:** Since May last year, **RBI has been raising the repo rate** (the rate at which the RBI lends to the banking system) → banks/other financial institutions charge higher interest rates → **existing EMIs** for home/car/business loans have been going up.

**The pros and cons of raising interest rates:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Pros**|**Cons**|
|**Contain inflation:** Higher EMI would dissuade enough people from borrowing money to fund future economic activity → slowdown in demand for money → bring down inflation → “too much money chasing too few goods”.|●       Hike per se cannot improve the supply of those goods and services<br><br>●       Prevent the “**second-order effects**” of high inflation → refer to a spike in people’s expectation of future inflation<br><br>●       **Limit India’s economic expansion and make unemployment worse**<br><br>●       A contractionary/tighter monetary policy (higher interest rates) increases **inequality** in an economy|

**Does bringing interest rates down reduce inequalities?**

- From the 2008 Global Financial Crisis until the war between Russia and Ukraine, most central banks practised an **expansionary/loose** monetary policy → low-interest rates → flooding the economy with additional money → spurring economic activity.
- But, there was growing criticism that **low-interest rates were leading to higher wealth inequalities**.
- **Here’s how**: When interest rates are low → **savers barely get any rewards** (save-you-lose) → most of the wealth creation happens in the stock markets → **stocks are mostly owned by the rich** (invest-you-win).

**What should be done given the harmful effects of both (contractionary/expansionary) monetary policies on inequality?**

- Widening inequalities is a very long-term trend, which **depends on deep structural changes in any economy** such as globalisation, technological progress, demographic trends etc.
- **A properly managed monetary policy** promotes greater economic stability and prosperity for the economy as a whole, by
    - Mitigating the effects of recessions on the labour market and
    - Keeping inflation low and stable.
- There is the need to rely on **fiscal policy** (taxes and government spending programs) and policies aimed at improving workers’ skills **to address distributional concerns.**

#### **GS Paper 2/3**

**Syllabus:** **International Relations/Environment, Conservation**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/un-to-start-allowing-deep-sea-mining-operations-from-july-issues-and-concerns-8532698/)

**Context:** The International Seabed Authority (ISA) has decided that **it will start taking permit applications from companies** that want to mine the ocean floor.

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Explor.jpg?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Explor.jpg)

**Background:.**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Deep-Sea Mining**|It involves retrieving mineral deposits from nodules that dot the ocean floor, typically more than 600 feet below sea level.|
|**Location:**|The most economically viable nodules lie partially under sediment in the **north-central Pacific Ocean, the southeastern Pacific Ocean, and the northern Indian Ocean.**|
|**Common Heritage of Humankind**|●       Under the **UNCLOS,** ocean areas beyond national jurisdiction and their mineral resources are the **_common heritage of humankind_.** <br><br>●       It contains most of the same **minerals** (but in enriched forms) that are found on land, as well as minerals that are unique to the deep ocean, such as **ferromanganese crusts and polymetallic nodules.**|

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Need for undersea mining:**|   |
|**1**|To extract **key battery materials** – cobalt, copper, nickel, and manganese – from potato-sized rocks called “**polymetallic nodules**” found at depths of 4 – 6 km.|
|**2**|Within the next 2 decades, the IEA predicts that renewable energy technology will make up over **40% of the demand for copper, 60 -70% for cobalt and nickel, and 90% for lithium.**|

**Concerns:**

At the 28th Session of the ISA (Kingston, Jamaica), several countries insisted that **industrial undersea mining requires strict rules.**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Concerns**|**Explanation**|
|**The mining code is missing**|The 36-member council is uncertain about the **process it should adopt for reviewing applications** for mining contracts.|
|**Rising Geopolitical Competition**|China has demonstrated its desire to shape international norms in the maritime domain, as exemplified by Beijing’s aggressive actions in the South China Sea.<br><br>**Holding 5 out of the 30 deep-sea mining exploration contracts** issued by the ISA(more than any other country), it is now leading the race to the bottom of the sea by **building superior capabilities and influencing the regulatory environment.**|
|**Damaging repercussions for the environment**|It would go beyond harming the seabed and have a wider impact on the deep-sea marine ecosystems in regulating the climate|
|·        Chile, France, Palau, and Fiji, among other nations, have called for a global moratorium on the practice, citing **environmental concerns and a lack of sufficient scientific data.**<br><br>·        In Resolution 122, IUCN notes that **if deep-sea mining is permitted to occur, biodiversity loss in these unique ecosystems will be inevitable, and the consequences for ocean ecosystem function, and for humanity, could be vast.**|   |

**Pros of Deep sea mining:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Pros**|**Explanation**|
|**Transition to Clean Energy**|·        Deep sea mining could **help meet the rising demand for energy transition metals.**<br><br>·        The demand for commodities like **copper, lithium, and rare earth** is expected to rise due to their essential role in the technologies and infrastructure needed to **decarbonize the global economy**.<br><br>·        Within the next two decades, the **IEA** predicts that renewable energy technology will make up over **40% of the demand for copper, 60-70% for cobalt and nickel, and 90% for lithium.**|
|**Energy Security**|Helps nations reduce their dependence on China for imports of rare earths & avoid a supply squeeze|

**Deep Ocean Mission by the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES)**

### [India celebrates 50 successful years of “Project Tiger”](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/04/india-celebrates-50-successful-years-of-project-tiger/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus: Environment Conservation**

 **Source:** [The Print](https://theprint.in/world/india-celebrates-50-successful-years-of-project-tiger/1490932/)

 **Context:** The Indian government will officially mark the **50th year of ‘Project Tiger’** on 9 April with a three-day event in Mysuru, Karnataka.

**Background:**

**Project Tiger-**an initiative to save tigers**,** was first initiated in the year **April 1, 1973** in **Jim Corbett National Park,** Uttarakhand.

**About Project Tiger:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Feature**|**Description**|
|**Objective**|·        To ensure the **maintenance of a viable population of tigers** in India for scientific, economic, aesthetic, cultural and ecological values.<br><br>·        To preserve, **for all times, areas of biological importance** as a national heritage for the benefit, education and enjoyment of the people.|
|**Type**|**Centrally Sponsered Scheme** under the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC)|
|**Implementing Authority**|National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) (est. 2005; HQ: New Delhi)|
|**About NTCA**|NTCA was established following a recommendation of the **Tiger Task Force**). It is a **statutory** body under the **Wildlife (Protection) Act, of 1972.**|
|**Members of NTCA**|**Union Minister** of the MoEFCC (as Chairperson)+ the Minister of State in the MoEFCC (as Vice-Chairperson)+ 3 MPs, Secretary, MoEFCC|
|**Functions of NTCA**|**Supervisory and coordination role** and approval of the **Tiger Conservation Plan** prepared by the State Governments.|
|**States Covered**|**18 States in India with 54 Tiger Reserves**  (Guru Ghasidas National Park and the Tamor Pingla Wildlife Sanctuary in Chhattisgarh being the latest)|

**About Tigers:**

**Achievements of Project Tiger**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Achievement**|**Description**|
|**Increased population**|The number of tigers in India has increased from 1827 (the 1970s) to around 2967, with a **30% rise in the population** in the last eight years.|
|**Increased coverage**|**9 tiger reserves covering 18,278 sq km in 9 states (the 1970s) to currently,** 54 tiger reserves spread over more than **75,000 sq km** in **18 tiger range** states.|
|**TX2 (goal of doubling wild tiger population by 2022)**|India met its goal in **2018** (four years ahead of its target) (**St. Petersburg Declaration on tiger conservation)**|
|**Protection of other animals**|As hunting was banned to save tigers, the population of many other animals started increasing.|
|**Global tiger population**|With a current population of about 3,000 tigers, **India is home to more than 70%** of the global tiger population.|

**Challenges faced by project tiger:**

- **Poaching:** Project Tiger’s efforts were mainly hampered by poaching, also by the debacles and irregularities in Sariska and Namdapha.
    - As per NTCA, 1059 tiger deaths were in the last 10 years, most in Madhya Pradesh
- **Conflict with FRA, 2006:** The [Forest Rights Act](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/02/11/forest-rights-act/) passed by the Indian government in 2006 recognizes the rights of some forest-dwelling communities in forest areas.
- **Lack of adequate protection** in the **outside tiger reserve.**
    - According to a report, nearly **29 per cent** of tigers lives outside of the core zone
- **Man-Animal Conflicts** Wildlife habitats are shrinking leading to more instances of human-animal conflict.
    - From 2001 to 2016, 1,065 cases of human-tiger conflict were recorded including injuries and even fatalities on both sides.

**Conclusion**

The tiger is a unique animal which plays a pivotal role in the health and diversity of an ecosystem.  However, there is a need for further community involvement through a tiger reserve that is not built with fences and armed patrol guards, but around a **cultural model of conservation** i.e. including local tribes **like Idu Mishmi in Arunachal Pradesh, who consider Tigers as their elder brother and sacred.**

### [Article 191(1)(e)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/04/article-1911e/)

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/centre-appropriate-party-to-respond-to-plea-on-disqualified-lawmakers-says-ec/article66695237.ece)

 **Context:** The Election Commission of India has chosen **not to take a stance on whether a disqualified lawmaker should be banned from contesting elections for five years**.

**The issue:**

A petition has been filed in SC that an MP or an MLA who has **either been disqualified from the House under the** [**Tenth Schedule (anti-defection law)**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/06/17/10th-schedule-of-the-constitution-5/#:~:text=The%20Tenth%20Schedule%20was%20inserted,other%20member%20of%20the%20House.) **or under Article 191(1)(e)** of the Constitution should be barred from contesting elections for five years. This is to **discourage MP/MLAs from switching** the political party to gain political favour.

**About the article:**

**Article 191(1)(e)** gives the **various grounds of disqualification** “for being chosen as, and for being a member of the Legislative Assembly or Legislative Council of a State” on:

- Holding an office of profit
- Being of unsound mind or undischarged solvent
- Being a non-citizen or voluntarily acquiring the citizenship of a foreign state
- Being under any acknowledgement of allegiance or adherence to a foreign state.
- If an MLA or an MLC is “disqualified by or under any law made by Parliament”

**ECI argument:** The issue falls under the interpretation of **Article 191(1)(e) of the Constitution**, and it would be appropriate for the Union government to deal with it. The commission’s mandate is limited to the conduct of elections in terms of the **remit of Article 324 of the Constitutio**n.

**Source:** [The Hindu](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/arctic-scientists-race-to-preserve-ice-memory/article66695243.ece)

**Context**: Arctic scientists are set to **start drilling to save samples of ancient ice for analysis** before the frozen layers melt away due to climate change.

- They will extract ice in a **series of tubes from as far as 125 metres (137 yards) below the surface**, containing **frozen geochemical traces dating back three centuries**.

**Why preserve ancient ice?**

- Analysis of chemicals in deep “ice cores” provides scientists with **valuable data about past environmental conditions.**
- Studies indicate that the **Arctic is warming between two and four times faster than the global average.**

**How will it be preserved?**

One set of ice tubes will be used for **immediate analysis** while a second set will be **sent to Antarctica for storage in an “ice memory sanctuary” under the snow**, where the samples will be preserved for future generations of scientists.

### [One of the biggest known black holes discovered](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/04/one-of-the-biggest-known-black-holes-discovered/)

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [Indian Express](https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/biggest-ultramassive-black-hole-gravity-lens-8528704/)

**Context**: Astronomers have discovered one of the biggest black holes ever found, **using** [gravitational lensing.](https://hubblesite.org/contents/articles/gravitational-lensing)

**About Gravitational Lensing:**

- Gravitational lensing is the name given to the **phenomenon where a foreground object**—a galaxy or a black hole—**bends the light from a more distant object behind it, magnifying it in the process.**

**How was the discovery made?**

- The researchers **used supercomputer simulations** that **simulated light from a faraway galaxy** travelling through the Universe **hundreds of thousands of times**. Each of the **simulations had a black hole of a different mass, changing the light’s journey to Earth.**
- When the researchers included an ultra-massive black hole in one of the simulations, the path taken by the light exactly matched the path seen in actual images captured by the Hubble Space Telescope.
- This helped them discover [the ultra-massive black hole](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/chandra/news/ultra_black_holes.html)**, over 30 billion times the mass of our Sun, in the foreground galaxy.**

This new approach taken by the researchers could make it possible to **study inactive black holes in distant galaxies, which is not currently possible with other existing techniques.**
