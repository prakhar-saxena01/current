### [The concept of fraternity](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/29/the-concept-of-fraternity/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Indian Constitution—Historical Underpinnings, Evolution, Features, Amendments, Significant Provisions and Basic Structure**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/the-challenge-of-reviving-a-sense-of-fraternity/article66782068.ece)

 **Context:** Since India imbibes the principle of ‘unity in diversity’, having a sense of fraternity is a virtue that is essential.

**Meaning of fraternity:**

- The word fraternity is **derived from French** to mean brotherhood, friendship, community and cooperation.
- It is **a sense of common brotherhood** among all Indians giving **unity and solidarity** to social life.

**The concept of fraternity in the Indian Constitution:**

- While submitting the Draft Constitution to the President of the Constituent Assembly (on 21 February 1948), **B R Ambedkar** (the chairman of the Drafting Committee) wrote that –
    - The drafting committee had added a clause on “fraternity” in the Preamble
    - Even though it was **not part of the Objective Resolution**
- As a result, the **Preamble** (adopted on 26 November 1949, came into effect on 26 January 1950 and amended by the 42nd Amendment 1976) to the Indian Constitution mentions –
    - “**Fraternity assuring the dignity of the individual and unity and integrity of the Nation**”.
- **Article 51A** (Fundamental Duties) added to by the 42nd Amendment 1976 referred to the duty of every citizen ‘**to promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood amongst all the people of India**’.
- Both the Preamble and the Fundamental Duties can not be legally enforced, but have a **moral, spiritual appeal.**

**Why is fraternity essential?**

- It is one of the **four pillars of constitutional morality** spelt out in the Preamble of India’s Constitution: justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity.
- **Without fraternity, equality and liberty** can’t be achieved, because the idea of fraternity is closely linked to **social solidarity.**
- **Gains coming from the other three are strengthened and enriched by a sense of fraternity.**

**Challenges that the concept face in India:**

- Fraternity remains the **least understood, least discussed, and the least practised** of the four pillars of constitutional morality.
- **Inequality and prejudice.**
- Politics of hate and weak democratic opposition.
- Taking the form of **loyalty to the state (nationalism)**, neglecting the principle of solidarity among citizens.
- Feminists often criticise the idea/definition of fraternity as it excludes “**sisterhood**.”
- **Inter-state conflicts** and challenges to internal security like **left-wing extremism, terrorism, cybersecurity, fake news, etc**

**Steps taken by the Indian government:**

- Inter-state councils, Zonal councils, Social initiatives like **Ek Bharat – Shrestha Bharat, National Foundation for Communal Harmony (NFCH)**, etc.
- A ‘uniform’ and ‘Common Minimum Programme for Value Education’ was launched across the entire schooling system with a focus on **‘core Constitutional values’.**

**Way ahead:**

- **Balancing the** dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the Nation.
- For this,
    - A functioning **moral order** in society and **a public conscience** is essential. This will help in imbibing the concept **individually and collectively.**
    - **Each of Gandhiji’s Seven Social Sins** must form the ethos of the socio-political fabric of India.

**Conclusion:** Ambedkar dreamed of an India in which divisions of caste and religion would gradually fade away in the spirit of fraternity. Therefore, investing in the concepts like fraternity would save society from fragmentation.

#### **GS2/GS3**

 **Syllabus: Governance: Regulators/** GS-3: Indian Economy and Issues

**Source:** [**BS**](https://www.business-standard.com/opinion/columns/sebi-at-age-31-or-is-it-35-123042701303_1.html)

 **Context:** The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) recently unveiled a new logo on the occasion of its 35th anniversary.

**About SEBI:**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/scbi.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/scbi.png)

**SEBI has been successful in its functions:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Function**|**Example of SEBI’s success**|
|**Protection of investors’ interests**|SEBI has taken action against fraudulent collective investment schemes  to protect investors’ interests e.g., **Action against the Sahara group** (2013)|
|**Impressive rise**|Assets under the **management of mutual funds**, the total number of **dematerialised accounts**, dematerialised turnover, the number of derivatives contracts, etc, have all grown exponentially.|
|**The smooth functioning of the securities market**|SEBI has introduced **online trading platforms** and **electronic clearing services**|
|**Regulation of securities market operations**|SEBI has introduced **regulations for insider trading, delisting of securities, and disclosure and investor protection guidelines**|
|**Education of investors**|SEBI‘s **‘Jan Jagruti Abhiyaan’** to educate investors about the securities market and their rights as investors.|
|**Prohibition of fraudulent and unfair trade practices**|SEBI has taken action against **market manipulations and price rigging**. In 2015, SEBI ordered a probe into suspected rigging of the **National Stock Exchange’s (NSE) algo-trading systems** and imposed a penalty of Rs 1,000 crore on NSE for its role in the **co-location case.**|
|**Ensuring compliance by market participants**|In 2018, SEBI fined **ICICI Bank and its CEO Chanda Kochhar** for violating disclosure norms related to a loan given to Videocon Group.|
|**Tackling insider trading**|In 2017, SEBI imposed a penalty on **Reliance Industries for alleged insider trading** in Reliance Petroleum shares in 2007.|

**Limitations of SEBI:**

 SEBI has **certain limitations in terms of its reach, enforcement powers, coordination with other regulatory bodies,** resources, and keeping up with changing market dynamics. These limitations can **create regulatory gaps and overlaps**, leading to delays in the resolution of cases.

**Examples:**

- SEBI’s alleged inaction in the **Ketan Parekh scam and Satyam scandal**
- SEBI’s inability to prevent the **NSEL scam**
- Failure of SEBI’s regulations to **prevent the misuse of participatory notes (P-notes)** by foreign investors

**Conclusion:**

There is a need for continuous monitoring and improving market intelligence to strengthen enforcement. Also, India’s financial markets are still segmented, and **a unified financial regulator** may be required to remove overlaps and excluded boundaries.

 **Context:** India’s representative at the **United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII)** faced criticism from **Adivasi rights activists** for stating that the concept of **‘indigenous people’** was not applicable in the Indian context.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**The Term “Indigenous People”**|**The Term “Tribals”**|
|Refers to those groups **who are regarded as native or original inhabitants** of a particular region or geographic area, and who have a historical, cultural, and spiritual relationship with the land.<br><br>However, there is **no singularly authoritative definition** of indigenous peoples under international law and policy|Refers to the communities in India who have **historically lived in forests and hilly regions and** have their distinct cultural practices and languages.|
|Recognized as distinct groups with their own language, culture, and traditions, and who have suffered historical injustices such as colonization, forced displacement, and discrimination.|Recognized by the Constitution of India as **Scheduled Tribes (STs)** and provided with certain protections and privileges.|
|Indian government argues that **“all Indians are indigenous to the Indian subcontinent**”, the concept of indigenous people is not applicable in the Indian context.|Critics argue that STs in India can be considered indigenous people as they have a distinct culture and tradition, and have faced historical injustices.|

**The UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples**, which India has ratified, recognizes the rights of Indigenous people, including their **right to self-determination**, and the government’s position goes against this international declaration. Also, every year, on 9 August, the **International Day of the World’s Indigenous Peoples** is marked.

### [Digital Services Act](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/29/digital-services-act/)

**Context:** European Commission adopted the first designation decisions under the Digital Services Act (DSA)

**Key features of the Digital Services Act (DSA):**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Feature**|**Description**|
|**Definition**|A set of **common rules on intermediaries’ obligations** and accountability across the single market|
|**Objective**|To **tightly regulate the way intermediaries**, especially large platforms such as **Google, Facebook, and YouTube**, function when it comes to moderating user content|
|**Faster Removals and Provisions**|Social media companies will have to add “**new procedures for faster removal”** of content **deemed illegal or harmful**. They will also have to explain to users how their **content takedown policy works**. The DSA also allows users to challenge takedown decisions taken by platforms and seek **out-of-court settlements**|
|**Greater Responsibility for VLOPs**|The law avoids a one-size-fits-all approach and places increased accountability on the **Big Tech companies**. Under the DSA, ‘Very Large Online Platforms’ (VLOPs) and ‘Very Large Online Search Engines’ (VLOSEs), that is platforms having more **than 45 million users** in the EU, will have more stringent requirements.|
|**Direct Supervision by EC**|The European Commission will be responsible for centrally supervising these requirements and their enforcement.|
|**More Transparency on Algorithms**|VLOPs and VLOSEs will face transparency **measures and scrutiny of how their algorithms work,** through **systemic risk analysis** and reduction to drive accountability about the social impacts of their products.|
|**Clearer Identifiers for Ads**|Online platforms must ensure that **users can easily identify advertisements and understand who presents or pays for the advertisement**. They must **not display personalised advertising** directed towards minors or based on sensitive personal data.|

**Comparison of EU’s DSA vs. India’s IT Rules:**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Criteria**|**EU’s DSA**|**India’s IT Rules (****Information Technology Rules, 2021****)**|
|**Scope**|This applies to **all intermediaries operating in the EU,** irrespective of their country|This applies to **all social media platforms operating in India**, irrespective of their country.|
|**Content Moderation**|Social media companies will have to add “new procedures for faster removal” of content deemed illegal or harmful.|Large social media platforms need to **appoint key personnel to handle law enforcement requests** and user grievances.|
|**Responsibility**|Places increased accountability on the Big Tech companies.|Places responsibility on social media platforms|
|**Encryption**|The DSA does not explicitly address encryption issues|The IT Rules mandate that social media platforms **identify the first originator of the information** on its platform under certain conditions, including cases of child sexual abuse material, which may compromise the encryption security on its platform.|

 **Context:** Recently, the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) dropped the **entire section on “Theory of evolution”** from its Class 10 textbooks.

**About Darwin’s theory of evolution:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Darwin’s Theory of Evolution**|   |
|**Definition**|Darwin’s theory of evolution is the process by which species of organisms develop and change over time through natural selection.|
|**Principles**<br><br>[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/homo.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/homo.png)|·        **Variation**: Individuals within a species have differences or variations.<br><br>·        **Inheritance**: Some of these variations are heritable and can be passed on to **offspring**.<br><br>·        **Selection**: Organisms with advantageous variations have a higher chance of surviving and reproducing, passing on these advantageous traits to their offspring.<br><br>·        **Time**: Evolution occurs **over long periods of time**, allowing for gradual changes to accumulate.|
|**Natural Selection**|Natural selection is the driving force behind evolution. Organisms with **advantageous traits are more likely to survive** and reproduce, passing on those traits to their offspring. Over time, this leads to the evolution of new species.|
|**Controversies**|Darwin’s theory of evolution has been controversial since its introduction. Some **religious and cultural beliefs** conflict with the idea of evolution.|
|**Influence**|**Lamarck**, the French naturalist proposed his own theory of evolution before Darwin; Darwin’s theory was an extension of **laissez-faire economics**; Darwin was greatly influenced by **Malthus’ ideas of competition** in an environment with limited resources.|
