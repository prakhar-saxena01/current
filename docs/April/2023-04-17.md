### [The link between ‘flash droughts’ and climate change](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/17/the-link-between-flash-droughts-and-climate-change/)

#### **GS Paper 1** 

**Syllabus: Important Geophysical Phenomena**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/as-world-warms-droughts-coming-on-faster-research-8556897/)

**Context:** According to a new study, **flash droughts are becoming more common and faster** to develop around the world, and human-caused climate change is a major reason.

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/crisis.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/crisis.png)

|**Flash Drought**|   |   |
|**Difference between Flash & Conventional Droughts**|[Flash drought](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/01/27/insights-into-editorial-more-flash-droughts-in-india-by-end-of-century/) is the **rapid onset or intensification of drought**. It is set in motion by **lower-than-normal rates of precipitation**, accompanied by **abnormally high temperatures (heat waves), winds and radiation**. Typically occurs during **warm seasons** and tropical/humid places are more vulnerable|**Conventional** [**Drought**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/05/12/drought-in-numbers-2022-report/) is **a slow-onset** (natural) **disaster** characterised by the lack of precipitation, resulting in a water shortage.|
|**Causes**|Higher temperature increases **evapotranspiration** – the process by which water is transferred from the land to the atmosphere by evaporation from the soil and by transpiration from plants.<br><br>Flash drought can also be tied to **rhythmic climatic patterns**, such as **El Nino** (in Asia) and **La Nina** (eastern Pacific) events.<br><br>If not predicted early enough, changes in soil moisture can cause **extensive damage to agriculture, economies, and ecosystem goods and services.**|   |
|**Prediction and Mitigation**|Changes in the rate of evapotranspiration and soil moisture have been identified as key early warning indicators.<br><br>**Vulnerability mapping** will help policymakers, and farmers plan accordingly.|   |

**Highlights of the study:**

- Flash droughts occurred more often than slower ones in **tropical/humid places like India**, Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and the Amazon basin.
- As **global warming** continues, more abrupt dry spells could have grave consequences for the livelihoods of people **dependent on rain-fed agriculture.**

### [Pollution in Ganga](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/17/pollution-in-ganga/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Conservation, Environmental Pollution and Degradation**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/environment/sewage-overload-why-the-ganga-remains-polluted-despite-cleanliness-drives-88651)

 **Context:** According to the Ministry of Jal Shakti, though the [**Namami Gange Programme**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/welfare-schemes/schemes-under-ministry-of-jalshakti/namami-gange-programme/#:~:text=About%20Namami%20Gange%20Programme,under%20Ministry%20of%20Jal%20Shakti.) has been able to reduce the overall pollution load in the Ganga River, the river still remains polluted.

**Namami Gange Programme:**

- It is an **Integrated Conservation Mission**, approved as a ‘Flagship Programme’ by the Union Government in 2014 with a budget outlay of Rs.20,000 Crore to accomplish the twin objectives of
    - Effective abatement of pollution,
    - Conservation and rejuvenation of National River Ganga.
- Since 2014, the Centre had taken up **409 projects** with a budget outlay of Rs 32,912.40 crore to clean up the river.

[**Pollution in the Ganga River**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/welfare-schemes/schemes-under-ministry-of-jalshakti/national-mission-for-clean-ganga-nmcg/)**:**

- At least **71% of the river’s monitoring stations** reported alarming levels of **faecal coliform** in January 2023.
- Faecal coliforms are a group of **bacteria** found in the gut and faeces of warm-blooded animals, which enters rivers through the **discharge of untreated sewage.**
- While **Uttarakhand** had permissible levels of faecal coliform [less than 2,500 most probable number (MPN) per 100 ml], numbers in three other states – **UP, Bihar and West Bengal** – are alarming.

**Why does river Ganga still remain polluted?**

- **Untreated waste** continues to be discharged in 60% of Ganga.
- While the five major states through which the river flows generated 10,139.3 million litres per day (MLD) of sewage, **they had a combined sewage treatment capacity of only 40%.**
- **Uttarakhand** is the only state with sufficient treatment capacity.

**Wider challenges:**

- **Higher biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)** at the majority of the stations.
    - **BOD** is a measure of the oxygen required by aerobic microorganisms to biochemically oxidise organic matter. It affects the amount of dissolved oxygen in rivers.
    - **The higher the BOD, the lesser the oxygen available to aquatic life.**
- **Lax monitoring** as the data collection and dissemination remains challenging.

**Way ahead:**

- **Treating industrial and chemical waste:** Sewage treatment plants (STPs) are going to be the mainstay of river cleaning.
- **Waste to wealth:** Identifying, developing and deploying technologies to treat waste to generate energy, recycle materials, and extract resources of value.

### [Can we democratise tiger conservation in India?](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/17/can-we-democratise-tiger-conservation-in-india/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Conservation, Environmental Pollution and Degradation**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/project-tiger-census-conservation-slipping/article66736632.ece)

 **Context:** As India celebrates 50 years of its [Project Tiger](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/04/india-celebrates-50-successful-years-of-project-tiger/) (1973), there is a need to reflect on what needs to change in conservation practice in India.

**Background:**

- The [Tiger](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/04/india-celebrates-50-successful-years-of-project-tiger/) is an “**umbrella species**”. Hence, saving the tiger means saving the entire ecosystem.
- Tigers in India **occur in a wide range of habitat types**, from the evergreen forests of the Western Ghats to the terai grasslands of the Himalayan foothills, and from the tropical dry forests of Rajasthan to the mangroves of the Sundarbans.
- **Project Tiger was able to sustain tiger populations** in most of the geographical regions.
- [**The Tiger Census 2022**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/04/india-celebrates-50-successful-years-of-project-tiger/) (interim) indicated **a 6.7% annual growth rate (in the last 4 years)** in the number of Tigers.
- The expected number would be **approximately 3167**, which is above the previous 2018-2019 estimate of 2,967 tigers.

**Issues with India’s conservation practice:**

- **Shifting baselines/conservation amnesia:** The figure of 1,400+ Tigers estimated in 2006 resulted in the celebration of **doubling the tiger population in 2019**.
- **Reintroduction plan:** This was done to reintroduce tigers from central Indian forests, where the populations are thriving.
    - However, this will lead to a loss of **genetic diversity**, reducing the hopes of maintaining long-term population viability and natural recovery.
- **Narrow and exclusive conservation practices:** Conservation in India depends entirely on a network of Protected Areas (PAs) and the focus stayed on boosting tiger numbers rather than their habitat and concomitant (prey) species.
    - Also, all-natural habitats are managed by one agency and therefore the approach to conservation is singular and exclusive.
- **Lack of scientific oversight:**
    - The most common interventions were to **manipulate ecosystems** so that they could support high densities of the Tiger’s principal prey species [“cheetalification” of tiger reserves].
    - **However**, in the Kanha Tiger Reserve, the explosion in the cheetal population made the habitat unsuitable for the endangered barasingha.
    - **The excessive provisioning of water** (in other parks) tends to reduce natural, climate-driven variations in populations of wildlife.
- **The** [**Wildlife Protection Act 1972**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/09/wildlife-protection-amendment-bill-2022/) **– a restrictive law:** There is no policy framework and incentive for ordinary citizens to aid in conservation – be it for tigers or for any other species.
    - As a result, conservation has not reached beyond these PAs.

**Impact of Unscientific Tiger conservation practices:**

- Fifty years after the Tiger census, the number of Tigers has remained **more or less the same.**
- The 2023 preliminary report, showed that
    - India is now **losing tigers from Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Eastern ghats** and the Northeastern forests.
    - While tiger populations within protected areas in the W. Ghats have remained stable or increased, **tiger occupancy outside of these regions has significantly decreased**.

**Way ahead:**

- **Decentralise conservation:** Frameworks that allow local communities, citizens, scientists, NGOs and businesses to participate meaningfully in conservation are needed.
- **For example**, “Reserved Forests” can be co-managed with an approach that is inclusive and provides economic benefits for local communities.

**Conclusion:** Only by extending the reach of conservation beyond the present PA system and empowering local communities and ordinary citizens to meaningfully participate in conservation actual doubling of tigers and other embattled wildlife can be achieved.

### [Clinical trial](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/17/clinical-trial/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus****: Science and Technology – Health**

**Source: TH**

 **Context**: The speedy approval of Covid-19 vaccines during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic highlighted the importance of clinical trials.

**What is a Clinical Trial?** 

A clinical trial is a research study conducted on human participants to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and/or effectiveness of an intervention such as a drug, device, or behavioural therapy.

**The objective of Clinical Trial**: Clinical trials are an essential component of the **drug development process** and are necessary to determine the benefits and risks of new treatments.

**Stages of Clinical Trial:**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cancer.jpg?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cancer.jpg)

**What is CTRI?**

**The Clinical Trials Registry – India (CTRI) (est. 2007; maintained by ICMR (under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare)** a national clinical trial registry in India.

- It is **mandatory to register for every trial at CTRI** before commencing
- CTRI is a **free online public record system** for the registration of clinical trials (both public and private research) conducted in India.

**Issues with the CTRI in India:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Issue**|**Examples**|
|**Missing data**|Only 281 of 606 (46%) trials were updated after the final enrollment|
|**Messy data**|Unclear data, such as the same acronym being used for two organizations or a clinical trial site being listed twice with the same principal investigator|
|**Misleading information**|Wrong data about whether a trial is registered prospectively or retrospectively|
|**Confusion over definitions**|A number of entries are inaccurate due to confusion over definitions, such as some ‘**interventional trials’ being listed as ‘observational trials’**|
|**Incomplete** **information**|Non-standardized information about cities causes confusion and repetition in the registry|
|**Variations in the classification of organizations**|All India Institute of Medical Sciences is classified as a ‘government-funded agency’, a ‘government medical college’, a ‘research institution’, and a ‘research institution and hospital’|

**Solutions:**

- **Ensure compliance with regulations**: The CTRI should ensure registration of all clinical trials in India
- **Adhere to WHO guidelines**: The CTRI should comply with the WHO guidelines and provide information for each trial, including audit trails, results fields, and data-sharing plans.
- **Improve record-keeping** of CTRI
- **Make CTRI a permanent activity**: The CTRI could be made a permanent activity with staff on a five-year contract, instead of relying on temporary staff for 15 years.

**Drug approval in India:**

A pharmaceutical company in India must **have DCGI approval** for selling a new prescription drug. They can get DCGI approval once drug regulator CDSCO verifies the

quality, safety, and efficacy of drugs including vaccines. Also, required is the approval from respective **Ethics Committee** where the study is planned and **mandatory registration** on the ICMR-maintained website

The **Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation** (statutory body under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act 1940) is India’s national regulatory body for cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and medical devices.
