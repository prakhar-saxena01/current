### [IT Rules amendments: Pros and Cons](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/10/it-rules-amendments-pros-and-cons/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Government Policies and Interventions for Development in various sectors and Issues arising out of their Design and Implementation**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/explained-will-platforms-have-to-take-down-fake-news/article66714424.ece)

**Context:** The MeitY notified the  [IT (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Amendment Rules 2023](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/07/the-it-intermediary-guidelines-and-digital-media-ethics-code-amendment-rules-2023/).

**For provisions of the amendments:** [**Click here**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/07/the-it-intermediary-guidelines-and-digital-media-ethics-code-amendment-rules-2023/)

 **About the amendments:** It empowers the Union Government **–**

- **To designate an official fact checker** for ‘fake news’, and
- **To regulate the online real money games** (to be certified as “permissible” by a Self-Regulatory Body), where users deposit money in expectation of winnings.
    - **Permissible:** The outcome doesn’t depend purely on chance.
    - **Not declared permissible:** Fall under the **betting and gambling**

**Analysing the recent amendments:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Pros**|**Cons**|
|●       These amendments remove social media firms’ immunity **if they decide to continue publishing ‘fake news’** that has been identified as such.<br><br>●       **Platforms are free to keep content** even after it is flagged as ‘fake news’.<br><br>●       The fact-checking setup will be<br><br>○       Credible<br><br>○       Independent **(following arm’s length principle)**<br><br>○       Possess the necessary **capacity** – technical, journalistic – to verify the information.<br><br>●       Freedom of the press [Article 19 (1)(a)] comes with **reasonable restrictions** [Article 19 (2)]|**Violates Shreya Singhal vs Union of India (2015) –** A verdict with clear guidelines for blocking content → Govt sets itself as **judge, jury and executioner**<br><br>**Similar to censorship** → Chilling effect on the fundamental right to speech and expression → **legally contentious**<br><br>**Lack of recourse/No right to appeal:** No other means of redress for intermediaries before the courts<br><br>Amendments were notified **without consulting** stakeholders/their views were not taken into account|

**Conclusion:** The dangers of fake news cannot be disputed. However, a system in which a government agency has the authority to judge the reliability of online content **should not be used to takedown opinions critical to the government.**

|**Feature of the scheme**|**Description**|
|**Full name**|Mudra – **Micro Units Development & Refinance Agency Ltd**|
|**Launch Year**|2015|
|**Ministry**|Department of Financial Services, Ministry of Finance|
|**Aim**|Providing loans **up to Rs. 10 lakh to non-corporate**, non-farm small/micro-enterprises|
|**Three pillars of the scheme**|**1.**      **Banking the Unbanked**<br><br>**2.**      **Securing the Unsecured**<br><br>3.      **Funding the Unfunded**|
|**Funding Provision**|MUDRA, a **financial institution** set up by the government, provides funding to the small business sector through institutions like Scheduled commercial banks, NBFCs, and MFIs.<br><br>MUDRA is a **refinancing** Institution. MUDRA **does not lend directly to micro-entrepreneurs** / individuals.|
|**Loan Products**|1.      **Shishu** (up to Rs. 50,000)<br><br>2.      **Kishore** (above Rs. 50,000 and up to Rs. 5 lakh)<br><br>3.      **Tarun** (above Rs. 5 lakh and up to Rs. 10 lakh)|
|**Collateral**|Loans under this scheme are **collateral-free loans**|

|**Expansion**|PMMY has been expanded over time to cover **activities related to agriculture, such as fishing, dairy, and food processing, and loans for tractors and power tillers, and two-wheelers** for commercial use were included in PMMY|
|**Steps taken to improve the scheme**|**udyamimitra portal** (for online applications); **End-to-end digital lending** for automated sanctions under PMMY (by some banks); Nomination of **Mudra Nodal Officers in PSBs**; **Interest Subvention** of **2%** on prompt repayment of Shishu loans|

**Challenges faced by the scheme:**

- **High non-performing assets** or bad loans
- **Limited funds** that cannot keep up with the pace of demand
- **Regional disparitie**s in the distribution of benefits
- **Lack of financial literacy** among beneficiaries leading to defaults
- **Limited outreach** to rural entrepreneurs
- **Collateral requirements for loans above a certain amount** make it difficult for many small enterprises to access credit
- **Loan size limitations of up to Rs. 10 lakhs,** which is inadequate for many small enterprises with higher capital requirements.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, the MUDRA scheme has been successful in providing credit to small entrepreneurs. However, it faces some significant challenges that need to be addressed to make it more effective and inclusive.

### [ISRO: Second Space Age](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/10/isro-second-space-age/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Awareness in the fields of Space**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/awaiting-lift-off-into-the-second-space-age/article66717782.ece)

 **Context:** India’s modest entry into the **First Space Age** followed by its many gains should be used to help the country tap the vast potential of the **Second Space Age.**

**Background:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**First Space Age**|**Second Space Age**|
|Began in 1957 with the launch of Sputnik 1 and ended in 1991|Began in the 1990s and continues to the present day|

**The Indian private sector in the Second Space Age:**

- From less than a dozen space **start-ups** five years ago, there are over 100 today.
- **The pace of investment is growing** (from $30 million in 2018, it doubled to $65 million in 2021).

**Size of Indian space economy:** Estimated to be about **$10 billion in 2020 and expected to be $13 billion by 2025 (global space economy – from $450 to $600 billion between 2020-25).**

**Potential:**

- Much greater ~$60 billion by 2030.
- The private sector is poised for take-off as a transformative **growth multiplier**.

**How can this potential be achieved?**

- **Enabling policy and regulatory environment**, **directly creating over 2 lakh jobs**.
- **In terms of end-user revenue**, media and entertainment account for 26% of India’s space economy, with consumer and retail services accounting for another 21%.
    - The share generated by the government needs to be **increased** (from only a fifth now).
- **In terms of space activities**, the share of upstream activities needs to **be increased.**
    - Downstream activities are dominant – over 70% of India’s space economy.
    - **Upstream activities** of satellite manufacturing and launch services contribute to the smaller share.

**Challenge and opportunity:** Regulation of the Indian private sector domain, which also provides a scope of expansion.

### [Use of AI for Legislation](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/10/use-of-ai-for-legislation/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus:** **Science and Technology – Developments and their Applications and Effects in Everyday Life**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/directing-ai-for-better-and-smarter-legislation/article66718048.ece)

 **Context:** Most mature democracies are now using Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools for better pieces of legislation and parliamentary procedures.

**How AI tools can assist parliamentarians?**

- In preparing responses for legislators,
- Enhancing research quality,
- Obtaining information about any Bill, preparing briefs,
- Providing information on particular House rules, legislative drafting, amendments, interventions, etc.
- AI can also **empower legislators** to make informed decisions by having access to
    - Insights into citizen grievances,
    - Media opinions, and
    - Voices of citizen-centric associations.

**In India,**

- Parliamentarians manage **large constituencies**.
- AI can analyse **citizens’ grievances and social media responses, and flag issues and priorities** that need immediate attention.
- It can also assist parliamentarians in seeking **citizen inputs for public consultation** of laws and preparing a manifesto.

**For AI to work in India:**

- **First, laws need to be codified:** The current laws are **opaque, and complex** and there is a huge **translation gap** between law-making, law-implementing and law-interpreting organisations.
    - The Indian government has set up the **India Code portal.**
- **The interface should contain a complete chain:** Right from the parent Act to the subordinate pieces of legislation enabling any entity to get a 360° view.
    - This becomes more critical in special situations such as **COVID-19**. **For example**, the central government issued over 900 while State governments issued over 6,000 notifications.

**How will this aid?**

- **Can act as a single window platform. For example,**
    - If an entrepreneur wants to open a manufacturing unit in Maharashtra, AI can tell what acts and compliances are applicable.
    - If a citizen wants to check the eligibility for welfare schemes, AI can recommend which schemes are eligible, based on details provided by citizens.
- **Can also simulate the potential effects of laws. For example,** various datasets such as the Census, data on household consumption, and taxpayers, can be modelled.
- **Can uncover potential outcomes of a policy.**
- **Can flag outdated laws.**

**Global best practices:**

- **The House of Representatives in the US:** Introduced an AI tool to automate the process of analysing differences between Bills, amendments and current laws.
    - This is to **readily see the impact of amendatory provisions** in Bills that they move through the legislative process.
- **The Netherlands House of Representatives**: “**Speech2Write**” system converts voice to text and “translates” voice into written reports.
- **Japan’s AI tool:** Assists in the preparation of responses for its legislature and also helps in the automatic selection of relevant highlights in parliamentary debates.
- **Brazil:** **Ulysses system** supports transparency and citizen participation.

**Initiatives in India:**

- The ‘One Nation, One Application’
- The National e-Vidhan (NeVA) portal

**Way ahead:**

- The use of AI must be encouraged in an **open, transparent, and citizen-friendly**
- To be mindful of the fact that **AI is a means to an end and not an end in itself.**

**Conclusion:**

- The COVID-19 pandemic has given a strong thrust to the Digital India initiative and the digitisation of services.
- This momentum needs to be kept up and utilised in the field of law, and policy-making, by harnessing the power of AI.

 **Context:** Union Cabinet has changed the **pricing regime for domestic natural gas** under the ambit of the administered price mechanism (APM)

**About APM:**

- APM applies to the pricing of gas produced by legacy fields (old Oil fields awarded to ONGC and OIL before 1999, when auctioning started)
- APM gas accounts for **about two-thirds of India’s natural gas production**,

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Criteria**|**Old Pricing System**|**New Pricing System**|
|**Application**|APM gas fields|Nomination fields of ONGC/OIL. New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) and Pre-NELP Block|
|**Pricing Formula**|‘Modified’ Rangarajan formula since November 1, 2014|Indexation to the price of imported crude oil|
|**Price Determination Frequency**|Quarterly|Monthly|
|**Price Calculation**|Based on the cost of production, returns, and a notional price of imported LNG|10% of the monthly average of the Indian crude basket|
|**Price Ceiling and Floor**|No floor or ceiling|Subjected to a floor and ceiling price that remains unchanged for 2 years|
|**The premium for Gas from New Wells**|No premium allowed|**20% over APM price** for gas produced from new fields|

 **Context:** Drugmakers have been given an **extension until August 1st** to implement the Track and Trace system for the export of pharmaceutical consignments.

- The extension was granted due to **difficulties faced by members of the pharma exporter body Pharmexcil** in joining the system.

**About the system:**

The system was designed to **address counterfeit and product recall issues** and has been in the works for **eight years**. It is based on **traceability and barcodes on the packaging**, which can help identify the source and prevent sabotage. The system covers secondary and tertiary packaging initially, with primary packaging to be included at a later stage.

**Status of India in Pharmacy:**

- India’s pharmaceutical exports rose **more than 3% to about $25 billion (FY23)** but have missed the $27 billion target.

**Source:** [**LM**](https://www.livemint.com/economy/india-is-well-within-its-right-to-ensure-quality-11680893545064.html)

**Context:** India has been issuing **quality control orders (QCO)** for products of mass consumption, including machinery safety equipment, pressure cookers, toys and air conditioners, **to curb Chinese imports and boost exports**.

- However, several WTO members have objected to this move and say that India’s QCOs are protectionist and may not be compliant with the WTO’s **Agreement on Technical Barriers**

**What are QCOs?**

The main aim of the QCO is to **control the import of sub-quality and cheaper items and to ensure that customers** get quality products. QCOs **cannot** be challenged at WTO if they are imposed on grounds of health, safety, environment and deceptive trade practice, or national security. BIS certifies it for International and domestic products.

**India’s stand:**

- All orders are in line with WTO norms
- India has the **right to impose QCOs** since they are first applied in the domestic market and then on imports.
- India’s rationale behind issuing QCOs is to **curb the dumping of cheap products from China** and to address the widening trade deficit, which is nearly 40% of the total deficit.

**About Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade:**

It provides regulations on technical standards including packaging, labelling requirements, and environmental quality standards to be kept during the trade. **As per the WTO’s agreement**, members **shall not adopt unnecessary obstacles** to international trade.
