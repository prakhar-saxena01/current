### [Critical minerals: Resilient supply chains](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/21/critical-minerals-resilient-supply-chains/)

**GS Paper 1**

 **Syllabus:** **Distribution of Key Natural Resources across the world (including South Asia and the Indian sub-continent)**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/experts-explain-challenges-india-faces-in-critical-minerals-supply-chains-8566220/)

 **Context:** A recent working paper evaluated the **criticality levels of 43 select minerals for India.**

**Background:**

- **Critical minerals** refer to **mineral resources**, both **primary and processed**, that are
    - **Economically important/demand-side factors** (to meet the manufacturing needs of green technologies, high-tech equipment, aviation, and national defence) and
    - **Have high levels of supply risk/supply-side factors** (due to non-availability or unaffordable price spikes).
- To tackle such supply risks, **major global economies periodically evaluate** which minerals are critical for their jurisdiction through a quantitative assessment.
- Minerals such as **antimony, cobalt, gallium, graphite, lithium, nickel, niobium, and strontium** are among the **22** assessed to be critical for **India**.
- India does not have many of these mineral reserves, **necessitating reliance on foreign partners to meet domestic needs.**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Assuring resilient critical minerals supply chains remains a challenge for India**|   |
|**International front**|**Domestic front**|
|[**China**, the most dominant player](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/08/05/rare-earth-elements-and-push-for-inclusion-in-supply-partnership/) in the critical mineral supply chains, still struggles with Covid-19-related lockdowns. <br><br>**The war between the two countries:**<br><br> **Russia** is one of the significant producers of nickel, palladium, titanium sponge metal, and the rare earth element scandium.<br><br>**Ukraine** is one of the major producers of titanium and has reserves of lithium, cobalt, graphite, and rare earth elements, including tantalum, niobium, and beryllium.<br><br>**The balance of power shifts across continents and countries**:<br><br>The strategic partnership between **China and Russia**.<br><br>As a result, developed countries have launched the **Minerals Security Partnership (MSP) and G7’s Sustainable Critical Minerals Alliance**. But, d**eveloping countries (like India) have missed out.**|While India has a geological potential similar to mining-rich Western Australia, **much still needs to be explored,** hindering India’s emissions reduction and climate change mitigation timeline.<br><br>Many critical and strategic minerals constitute part of the list of atomic minerals in **the** [**Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) (MMDR) Act 1957**.](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/03/10/amendment-to-mines-and-minerals-development-and-regulation-act/)<br><br>However, the present policy regime **reserves these minerals only for public sector undertakings.**<br><br> **Long lead times** for setting up new exploration, extraction, and processing activities.|

**Way ahead:**

- There is an imperative need to create **a new list of such minerals in the MMDR Act**. These minerals must be **prospected, explored, and mined on priority.**
- The reconnaissance and exploration of minerals must be encouraged, **with particular attention given to deep-seated minerals**.
    - This will call for **a collective effort** by the government, ‘junior’ miners, and major mining companies.
- **An innovative regime** must be devised to allocate critical mineral mining assets, which adequately incentivises private explorers, including ‘junior’ explorers.
- India needs to determine where and how the **processing** of minerals and **assembly** of critical minerals-embedded equipment will occur.
- India requires **a critical minerals strategy** comprising measures aimed at making the country **AatmaNirbhar** (self-reliant) in critical minerals needed for sustainable economic growth.
- India must actively engage in **bilateral and plurilateral arrangements** for building assured and resilient critical mineral supply chains.
- **The assessment** of critical minerals for India needs to be updated every three years to keep pace with changing domestic and global scenarios.

**Conclusion:** A national critical minerals strategy for India, underpinned by the minerals identified in this study, can help focus on priority concerns in supply risks, domestic policy regimes, and sustainability.

### [16th Civil Services Day](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/21/16th-civil-services-day/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Role of Civil Services in a Democracy**

**Source:** [**PIB**](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1918299) 

**Context: National** Civil Service Day, observed on April 21 every year, is a celebration of the idea of national civil service.

- The **first** National Civil Services Day was celebrated on **April 21, 2006**.

**Background:**

- Civil servants **constitute the** [**backbone of the administration**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/20/reforms-in-indian-civil-services/).
- They **ensure the** [**implementation of government policies**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/governance/role-of-civil-service-in-a-democracy/functions-of-civil-service-in-21st-century-india/), ensuring the passage of benefits to the people.
- **The civil services in India** consist of the
    - Indian Administrative Service (IAS)
    - Indian Police Service (IPS)
    - Indian Foreign Service (IFS) and
    - A comprehensive list of other Central Services (Group A, B)
- It commemorates the day when **Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel** – independent India’s first Home Minister, inaugurated the newly-created Indian Administrative Service in 1947**,** calling them the “**steel frame of India**.”

[**A new ethic of civil servants:**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/governance/role-of-civil-service-in-a-democracy/functions-of-civil-service-in-21st-century-india/)

- **Selfless service and empathy.**
- **Duty-bound** to drive India’s transition from Amrit Mahotsav to Amrit Kaal.
- **The removal of a colonial mindset**, sharing a sense of pride in the Indian roots, with a **nation-first approach.**
- **A future-ready civil service,** which is
    - Proactive and polite;
    - Professional and progressive;
    - Energetic and enabling;
    - Transparent and tech-enabled;
    - Creative and constructive; and
    - Imaginative and innovative.

**Desired outcomes for the Indian civil services:**

- **Maximum Governance, Minimum Government**
- **Cooperative Federalism** through uniformity in administration across the Union and the States

**Conclusion:**

- The Indian civil services must transform itself from a rigid, restrictive and rule-bound colonial bureaucracy to one **rooted in the national ethos**.
- **_“…now, you are serving your own people, so you have to serve with your heart and mind and soul…” (Sardar Patel while inaugurating the new IAS in 1947)_**

### [Biomass pellets](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/21/biomass-pellets/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Conservation and pollution-related issues**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/pollution/biomass-pellets-cpcb-s-revised-grants-highly-inadequate-to-close-demand-supply-gap-88875)

 **Context:** The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) revised the financial grants for **biomass pellet manufacturing units.**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/renewable-1.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/renewable-1.png)

**What are Biomass pellets?**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Meaning**|These are a type of **solid fuel** made from **compressed organic material** (biomass) such as industrial waste and co-products, food waste, agricultural residues, energy crops, and untreated lumber.|
|**Types**|These are of two kinds – **torrefied** (Biomass processed at 250-350°C in the absence of oxygen) **and non-torrefied** **pellets** (biomass is shredded, ground and sent to a pellet reactor, where it is compressed and bonded).|
|**Advantages**|Pellets are extremely dense and can be produced with a low moisture content (below 10%) which allows them to be burned with a **very high combustion efficiency.**<br><br>**Emissions** such as NOx, SOx and volatile organic compounds from pellet burning equipment are in general very low.|
|**Disadvantages**|**A recognized problem is the emission of fine particulate matter into the air.**<br><br>**The capital expenditure** for setting up a pellet manufacturing unit entails variables such as land, machinery, air pollution control devices, factory infrastructures such as sheds and offices, etc.|
|**Potential**|Pelletised biomass can p**otentially produce 6% of India’s total electricity in 2030/31**, in addition to direct biomass co-firing for electricity production.|

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/anual.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/anual.png)

**Biomass pellets production/usage in India:**

- **It is mandatory to use biomass or agricultural residue** (**5-10%**) as combustion fuel along with coal in coal-fired thermal power plants.
- **The biomass used for co-combustion** in the power plants is processed and **refined into pellets** with a calorific value comparable to coal.

**CPCB decision:**

- Increased the budget for manufacturing **non-torrefied biomass** pellets to 28 lakhs (from 14 lakhs) per tonne per hour (TPH) of production capacity/40% of the capital cost of the plant and machinery – whichever is lower.
- In the case of manufacturing **torrefied biomass**, no changes are introduced in the fund allocation (of Rs 28 lakhs per TPH) in the revised CPCB guidelines.

**Concerns:**

- **These allocations are grossly insufficient** to meet the current requirements of the pellet manufacturing industry.
    - The cost of machinery with a production capacity of one TPH is **approximately Rs 1 crore** and the grants would cover only 28% of the capital investment.
- **This gross underestimation** will not help close the existing demand-supply gap as the country has limited pellet manufacturers.

**Way ahead:**

- An imminent need to escalate the biomass pellet manufacturing capacity in the country**.**
- **Indira Gandhi Super Thermal Power Project of NTPC** in Jhajjar, Haryana has taken steps towards facilitating the establishment of pellet manufacturing units.
    - More such initiatives need to be taken by the power generators and the government.
- **All the actors in the supply chain**, starting from the farmers and aggregators to pellet manufacturers, must be incentivised.

### [Animal Birth Control Rules, 2023](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/21/animal-birth-control-rules-2023/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus****: Agriculture: Animal Husbandry**

**Source:** [**Th**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/caring-for-strays-the-hindu-editorial-on-the-impact-of-the-animal-birth-control-rules-2023/article66760036.ece)

 **Context:** The government has announced new **Animal Birth Control (ABC) Rules 2023**, which require strays to be caught, vaccinated, neutered, and released back into the community.

- The ABC 2023 rules will supersede the **Animal Birth Control (Dog) Rules, 2001**
- Previously, the Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying opened a **draft Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Amendment) Bill, 2022,** for public comment.

**Need for such rules:**

India has more than **1.5 crores of the stray** dog population. Over the last five years, more than 300 people — mostly children from poor and rural families — have been attacked and killed by dogs. Over 20,000 deaths were due to Rabies.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Provision**|**Description**|
|**Aim**|To reduce the stray dog population by addressing animal welfare issues.|
|**Sterilization and Immunization**|The programme for the **sterilization and immunization of stray dogs** shall be carried out by the **respective local bodies,** municipalities, municipal corporations, and panchayats, with the help of the **Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI)**-a recognized organization.|
|**ABC+ Anti-Rabies**|Local bodies need to implement the **ABC and Anti-Rabies Program jointly.**|
|**Addressing cruelty**|In carrying out the ABC program, ‘cruelty to animals’ should be addressed|
|**Community Animals**|The Rules transform stray dogs into a new class of **“community animals.”**|
|**Care of stray dogs**|**Resident welfare associations** are responsible for caring for stray dogs and feeding them at fixed intervals, away from children and the elderly.|
|**Human and Stray dog conflicts**|The Rules provide guidelines on how to deal with human and stray dog conflicts **without relocating the dogs in an area**.|
|**Prohibition**|The Rules **prohibit the improper disposal of solid waste** and casual feeding of dogs.|
|**Responsibility**|Local authorities **“will be held responsible for any violation** [during birth-control procedures] and animal-human conflicts.”|

**Significance of the Rules:**

The new rules will help in **reducing the stray dog** and cat population and resolving the **Human-Dog conflict.**

**Issues with the new rules:**

- **Homelessness**: The ABC Rules do not provide for the rehabilitation of stray dogs, and instead, they are left on the streets after sterilization and vaccination.
- **Responsibility**: The ABC Rules place the responsibility of caring for stray dogs on the local residents’ welfare associations, which may not have the resources or capacity to provide proper care.
- **Funding and implementation**: There are concerns that the lack of adequate funding and implementation may lead to the rules being ineffective in addressing the stray dog problem.

**Ethical Concerns with the Rules:**

- **Consent**: Animals cannot give their consent to the procedure
- **Pain and suffering:** The procedure can cause pain and suffering to animals
- **Effectiveness**: Sterilization may not always be an effective method of controlling the population of animals
- **Alternatives**: Adopt non-invasive alternatives e.g., Awareness campaigns like **“Be a Human, Save a Life”** by the Delhi government to encourage people to adopt stray dogs

[**About Prevention of Cruelty to Animal Act, 1960:**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/12/18/prevention-of-cruelty-to-animals-act-1960-2/#:~:text=This%20Act%20provides%20for%20punishment,on%20animals%20for%20scientific%20purposes.)

The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 is the **first law** enacted to **safeguard the rights of animals** and protect them from **pain and suffering** caused by humans. It defines animals as **any living creature other than humans** and outlines **punishments** for those who inflict unnecessary cruelty on them. It also includes guidelines for experimenting on animals for scientific purposes and the exhibition of performing animals. The establishment of the **Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI)** is one of the key features of this Act.

Over the last 50 years, about **89% of the accumulated heat** is stored in the ocean, **6% on land**, a per cent in the atmosphere, and about **4% available for melting the cryosphere**.

**Impact of this increasing heat absorption:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Earth System Components**|**Impact of Increasing Heat Absorption**|
|**Land**|Increased ground surface temperaturesà Trigger decomposition of soil organic matter and plant litter by soil microbesà will release carbon dioxide in the process. **Higher soil respiration** can decrease soil water.|
|**Water Bodies**|Heat storage within inland water bodies à An increase in lake water temperaturesàMaking conditions ripe for **algal blooms**|
|**Troposphere**|The lower atmosphere, also known as the troposphere, is warming up due to increased heat accumulation, especially in the upper troposphere in the tropicsà Changes in the **Earth’s climate, circulation and weather patterns**.|
|**Cryosphere**|Increased heat uptake à Melting of grounded and floating ice**à**  **less albedo effect** à Contribute significantly to the overall cryosphere heat gain|

**What is** [**Earth’s Energy Imbalance**](https://gcos.wmo.int/en/news/where-does-heat-go)**?**

It refers to the difference between the **amount of energy that the Earth receives from the Sun and the amount of energy that it radiates** back to space.

- **Positive EEI:** When this imbalance is positive, it means that **more energy is entering the Earth’s system than is leaving it**, which leads to a warming planet.
- **Significance:** EEI is an important indicator of climate change and provides an estimate of how much and how fast the Earth’s climate is warming.

### [EMIC plasma wave](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/21/emic-plasma-wave/)

**Source:** [**BS**](https://www.business-standard.com/india-news/scientists-study-emic-plasma-wave-identified-in-indian-antarctic-station-123041800737_1.html)

 **Context:** Scientists in India have identified a type of **plasma wave called Electromagnetic Ion Cyclotron (EMIC) waves** at the Indian **Antarctic station, Maitri.**

**What is Plasma?**

Plasma is often referred to as the **fourth state of matter**, along with solid, liquid, and gas. It is a type of gas that is **made up of electrically charged particles**, such as ions and free electrons. Plasma can be found in many places, including **flames, lightning, and the sun**.

**What are Electromagnetic Ion Cyclotron (EMIC) waves?**

**It is a type of plasma wave** that is generated in the **Earth’s magnetosphere**, a region of space around the Earth that is affected by the planet’s magnetic field. These waves can resonate with charged particles, particularly ions, that are trapped in the magnetosphere, causing them to **move in a cyclical motion**.

**Significance of the study of EMIC waves:**

The study can help understand the impact of energetic particles (esp. Killer electrons) in the radiation belts on the low orbiting satellites.

- **Killer electrons** are electrons **having speed close to the speed of light**, which form the radiation belt of planet Earth
