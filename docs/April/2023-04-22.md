### [The State of the World’s Children 2023](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/22/the-state-of-the-worlds-children-2023/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus****: Social Justice**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/india-is-1-of-3-countries-where-confidence-in-childrens-vaccines-has-increased-unicef-report/article66758883.ece)**,** [**UNICEF**](https://www.unicef-irc.org/events/the-state-of-the-worlds-children-2023-imunization.html)

 **Context:** UNICEF released its global flagship report ‘The State of the World’s Children 2023: For Every Child, Vaccination,’ highlighting the significance of childhood immunization.

**What is Immunization?**

Immunization, also known as vaccination, is the process of protecting an individual or a population from disease by introducing a **substance that stimulates the body’s immune system** to recognize and fight the disease-causing agent, such as a virus or bacteria.

**The major findings of the report are:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Finding**|**Example**|
|**The decline in vaccine confidence globally**|Over a third of the 55 countries studied for **vaccine confidence showed a decline.**|
|**The largest decline in childhood immunization in 30 years**|A total of **67 million children missed out on vaccinations** between 2019 and 2021. In 2022, the number of measles cases was more than double the total in the previous year.|
|**Existing inequities in vaccination access**|Unvaccinated children often live in **hard-to-reach communities** such as rural areas or urban slums.|
|**The growing threat of Vaccine Hesitancy**|There is a growing threat of vaccine hesitancy due to factors such as **access to misleading information and declining trust in vaccine efficacy.**|

**India-specific findings:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Decrease in the number of zero-dose children during the pandemic**|Between 2020 and 2021, the number of **zero-dose children** in India decreased from **3 million to 2.7** million. However, India was among the **top 20 countries with the largest numbers of zero-dose children**|
|**Improvement in the ‘Importance Given to Vaccines’**|98% of the population in India currently perceive vaccines as important for children|

**Recommendations:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Emphasizes sustained evidence-based catch-up campaigns**|India was able to **bring down the number of zero-dose children** due to sustained evidence-based catch-up **campaigns (e.g.,** Intensified Mission Indradhanush (IMI), ASHA workers, routine immunization)|
|**Accelerating the implementation**|Increase the implementation of **Immunization Agenda 2030** and **Gavi Strategy 5.0** to promote equity and sustainably scale up immunization coverage.|
|**Strengthen demand for vaccination**|Demand for vaccination can be strengthened by talking to communities, tackling gender barriers, and rethinking accountability in health systems.|
|**Importance of investing in primary healthcare**|Spending more on **immunization and health by investing in primary health care** at the national level can help promote sustainable and equitable vaccine coverage.|
|**Need to build resilient systems**|E.g., India’s digital health platform **TeCHO+ (Technology Enabled Community Health Operations)** and **electronic vaccine intelligence network (eVIN)** increased vaccination coverage while enhancing data entry efficiency|

**Conclusion:**

Reaching the last child with immunization is a key marker of equity that benefits not only the child but also the whole community. Routine immunizations and strong health systems can best prepare us in preventing future pandemics and reducing morbidity and mortality.

**Terms used:** 

- **“Zero dose children”** refers to children who have **not received any vaccines at all** or have not received any vaccines according to the recommended schedule for their age.
- **Vaccine Hesitancy:** Vaccine hesitancy refers to the reluctance of an individual or a group of people to get vaccinated despite the availability of vaccines.
- **Vaccine confidence** refers to the level of trust and belief individuals and communities have in the safety and effectiveness of vaccines.

**About UNICEF:**

**United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)** (est. 1946; became a part of UN in 1953; HQ: New York) is an agency of the United Nations (UN) devoted to aiding national efforts to improve the **health, nutrition, education, and general welfare of children**. It is guided by the **Convention on the Rights of the Child, 1989**.

### [China- Central Asia and India](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/22/china-central-asia-and-india/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **International Relations**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/china-and-central-asia-xi-jinping-russia-visit-vladimir-putin-8567782/)

 **Context:** China convened a meeting (online) of trade ministers of the grouping known as **C+C5.**

**C+C5:**

It constitutes **China and the five Central Asian republics**, namely Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Kyrgyzstan.

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kaza.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kaza.png)

**China and Central Asia:**

- China shares **a long history of trade, culture, and people-to-people links** with the Central Asian region, which lies on the **ancient Silk Route**.
- Modern China’s involvement with the region began with the **break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991**.
- Diplomatic relations were established in **1992**, and China’s relationship with the region was institutionalised as the **Shanghai Five**, the forerunner of the [**Shanghai Cooperation Organisation** (SCO).](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/09/18/shanghai-cooperation-organisation-sco-3/)

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Mutual benefits**|   |
|**For China**|**For C5**|
|Central Asia is a **readymade market for cheap exports** and gave China **overland access to markets in Europe and West Asia**.<br><br>The region is resource-rich, with massive **gas and oil reserves, and strategic minerals such as uranium, copper, and gold**.<br><br>China also had another priority in its relationship with these countries – **to ensure peace in Xinjiang Autonomous Region**, which forms its frontier with Central Asia.<br><br>The BRI **plays a critical role as a transit hub for China’s trade with Europe.**|Chinese investments **helped to upgrade Soviet-era infrastructure and carry out development works** in these countries.<br><br>President Xi launched his Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), **a modern version of the Silk Road**, during his 2013 visit to the Kazakh capital Almaty.<br><br>Beijing has also pumped billions of dollars in **investments that cover projects** from oil and gas exploration, rail, road and seaport connectivity to digital technologies and green energy.<br><br>**Access to the Pacific Ocean and East Asia** to the landlocked region.<br><br>China, unlike the West, asks **no questions about their governance or human rights record.**|

**Friction points between China and Central Asia**:

- **Beijing’s targeting of the Muslim population of Xinjiang** has triggered resentment in these countries, where Islam is the principal religion.
- **The increasing presence** of Chinese workers and rapid land acquisitions by China in these countries has led to public protests.

**China’s ‘Grand Plan’ for Relations:**

- **The region is economically dependent on Russia**, which is also Central Asia’s net security provider.
- **Russia’s trade with these countries has increased** over the last year, as it attempts to find substitutes for imports from Europe.
- **Russia also has a huge migrant population of Central Asians** who bind the region to it in economic dependency.
- **Russia and China** are now competing for the title of the top trading partner in the area. The trade between China and the five countries reached **$70.2** billion last year.
- Beijing is making use of **Russia’s preoccupation in Ukraine** to push Moscow out of its own strategic backyard.
- The Ukrainian invasion has given rise to fears (among Central Asian countries) that a **security relationship with Moscow could prove to be a double-edged weapon.**

- While India has trading ties with these countries, it is **hindered by the absence of a land route to Central Asia**, with Pakistan denying its passage and Afghanistan being uncertain territory after the Taliban takeover.
- **The** [**Chabahar port**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/02/01/chabahar-port-3/#:~:text=Why%20Chabahar%20port%20is%20important,Iran%2C%20Europe%20and%20Central%20Asia.) **in Iran** offers an alternative route, but it is not fully developed yet.
- Also, India’s relationships in the region (including in the SCO) **remain security-driven**.
- There have been suggestions that India should provide connectivity for people and trade in Central Asia through “**air corridors**”, as it had done for Afghanistan.
- As a first, **New Delhi made its biggest outreach to Central Asia**, when the PM of India hosted a virtual summit of the C5 last year.
- New Delhi’s leadership of the SCO this year may provide it with an opportunity to diversify relations with this strategic region.

### [How AI can help the environment](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/22/how-ai-can-help-the-environment/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus****: Environment/ Science and Technology**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/how-ai-can-help-the-environment-8568456/#:~:text=A%20recent%20report%20estimated%20that,around%2037%20gigatons%20in%202022.)

**Context**: Previously, we talked about the [use of AI for Medicine](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/19/use-of-artificial-intelligence-in-medicine/). Here we will see AI applications for the environment.

**Some examples of how AI can help the environment:**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Application**|**Description**|**Example**|
|**Deforestation monitoring**|Deforestation and land use changes cause more than **10% of global greenhouse gas emissions**. Using AI to monitor **forest sounds and detect illegal logging**|Non-profit organization the Rainforest Connection’s “**Guardian**” devices, which **attach acoustic monitoring sensors** to trees to detect sounds associated with illegal logging|
|**Carbon footprint reduction in the industry**|Using AI to **optimize** industrial processes and reduce carbon emissions|**Fero Labs’ AI-driven optimization software**, which reduces the amount of mined ingredients used in steel production|
|**Energy efficiency in buildings**|Using AI to optimize **heating, ventilation, and air conditioning** systems in buildings|**Arup’s Neuron app**, which uses IoT sensors to gather data on building energy usage and optimize HVAC systems|
|**Wildlife conservation**|Using AI to monitor and protect endangered species|**Rouxcel Technology’s AI-enabled bracelets for rhinos,** monitor their movements and alert authorities to potential threats|
|[**Smart agriculture**](https://www.weforum.org/impact/ai-for-agriculture-in-india/)|Using AI to optimize farming processes and reduce waste|**John Deere’s AI-powered system**, which optimizes planting, irrigation, and fertilization for crops|
|**Climate modelling**|Using AI to make predictions about climate patterns and inform climate policy|**The UK’s Met Office,** which uses AI to model climate patterns and inform government policy on climate change|
|**Renewable energy management**|Using AI to manage and optimize renewable energy sources|**IBM’s Watson Energy**, which uses AI to optimize the performance of wind and solar energy systems|

**Challenges in the use of AI for the Environment:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Challenge**|**Example**|
|**Data quality and quantity**|AI models require high-quality data to perform accurately, and the **availability of large and diverse datasets can be limited**|
|**Bias in data and algorithms**|For example, an AI system that recommends conservation areas to protect might **not account for cultural significance or indigenous knowledge**.|
|**Interpretability**|E.g., it may be challenging to understand how a deep learning model **classifies satellite images to detect deforestation**.|
|**Scalability and deployment**|E.g., deploying sensors to collect environmental data in remote locations or deploying drones to monitor wildlife may require significant investment.|
|**Ethical considerations**|E.g., the use of **facial recognition technology** to monitor endangered species could violate the privacy of individuals visiting conservation areas.|

**Conclusion:**

AI is a powerful tool that, when used appropriately, can help address some of the most pressing environmental challenges facing our planet. By leveraging the strengths of AI and addressing the challenges it presents, we can develop sustainable and innovative solutions for a better future.

### [All India Report of First Census of Water Bodies](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/22/all-india-report-of-first-census-of-water-bodies/)  

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Environment, Conservation**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/bengal-tops-list-of-states-with-most-ponds-and-reservoirs-first-ever-waterbody-census-8567772/)

 **Context:** Ministry of Jal Shakti has launched the **1st Census of Water Bodies** in convergence with the 6th Minor Irrigation (MI) Census under the **Centrally Sponsored Scheme “Irrigation Census**”.

**Background:**

- Since water is a **state subject** under the 7th Schedule of the Indian Constitution, the relevant State Governments are primarily responsible for taking action.
- Through a number of schemes and programs, **the Central Government offers technical and financial assistance to support their efforts.**
    - As an illustration, the [**Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/welfare-schemes/schemes-under-ministry-of-agriculture/pradhan-mantri-krishi-sinchai-yojana/) (PMKSY)-Har Khet Ko Pani (HKKP) scheme provides for the Repair, Renovation, and Restoration (RRR) of Water Bodies.

**The First Census of Water Bodies**

- **Objective:** To develop a national database for all water bodies by collecting information on their size, condition, status of encroachments, use, storage capacity, the status of filling up of storage, etc.
- **What is unique about the census?**
    - Until the 5th minor irrigation census, water body data was only available at the village level.
    - The first water body census **included data on all types of water bodies in both rural and urban areas.**
    - For the first time, data on the **encroachment** of water bodies was also gathered during the census.
- **The census defines a water body as**: All natural or man-made units bounded on all sides with some or no masonry work used for storing water for irrigation or other purposes (industrial, domestic or drinking, groundwater recharge, etc).

**Highlights of the first census:**

- **24,24,540** water bodies have been enumerated in the country, out of which **1%** are in rural areas and only **2.9%** in urban areas.
- West Bengal’s **South 24 Parganas** has been ranked as the top district having the highest (**55 lakh**) number of water bodies across the country.

**[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/states.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/states.png)**

**Classification of water bodies:**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/distribution.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/distribution.png)

- **West Bengal** has the highest number of ponds and reservoirs, whereas **Andhra Pradesh** has the highest number of tanks.
- **Tamil Nadu** has the highest number of lakes and **Maharashtra** is the leading state with water conservation schemes.

**Data on encroachment:** 1.6% of water bodies are reported to be encroached, out of which 95.4% are in rural areas and the remaining 4.6% in urban areas.

**Way ahead for Augmentation, Conservation and Efficient Management of Water Resources:**

- Inclusion of water bodies in land records
- Making them an integral part of the town planning process
- Strict action against the encroachers

**India-specific findings and predictions:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Findings**|**Predictions**|
|**Heatwaves** in the 2022 pre-monsoon season in India caused a decline in crop yields. A number of **forest fires**, particularly in Uttarakhand.<br><br>This, combined with the **banning of wheat exports and restrictions on rice exports** in India, posed high risks to countries already affected by shortages of staple foods.<br><br>**The Indian Monsoon onse**t was earlier and the withdrawal was later than normal in 2022. The majority of the Indian subcontinent was wetter than average.|Heatwave conditions existed even in **February** which is not even a summer month.<br><br>After a relatively cool March, heat waves were back in April.<br><br>With the La Nina phase getting over, and forecasts of El Nino taking over in a few months, **this year is predicted to be warmer than 2022.**<br><br>The IMD has predicted a normal monsoon this year, but the impact of **El Nino** led to fears that rainfall might be suppressed**.**|

**What is Water Budget?**

**A water budget** is a tool used to manage water resources by **estimating the total amount of water available** in a region and the amount of water used by different sectors.

**Benefits:**

- It helps in making **informed decisions** about water use
- Identifying areas of water scarcity
- Developing strategies for equitable water distribution.
- Create awareness about proper water use and avoiding wastage.

**Other initiatives of the Kerala government**: It has revived **over 15,000 kilometres** of waterways in the last few years, and local bodies are rejuvenating more ponds and streams.

**Usage:** This can be used as an example in Governance, and Agriculture questions on water management.

### [Transfer pricing-“arm’s length price”](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/22/transfer-pricing-arms-length-price/)

**Source:** [**FE**](https://www.financialexpress.com/money/income-tax/supreme-court-tax-ruling-may-add-to-litigation/3056350/) 

**Context:** The recent Supreme Court ruling that the **“arm’s length price”** determined by the **Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT)** cannot be treated as final in disputes related to alleged **income suppression by multinational companies** could potentially increase fresh litigation and delay final decisions.

**What is Transfer pricing?**

Transfer pricing refers to the **pricing of goods, services, or intellectual property** that is sold between two or more companies that are part of the same multinational enterprise (e.g., subsidiaries).

**What is the “arm’s length price”?**

Arm’s length price is a transaction in which **buyers and sellers of a product act independently and have no relationship** with each other.

**Impact of the Judgement:**

- It may **delay and increase the litigation**
- The ruling may increase the use of conciliatory mechanisms like **advance pricing agreements** (APAs)
- It could also increase the utility of **MAP (mutual agreement procedure**), as an alternate dispute resolution mechanism.
- **It will increase the usefulness of Safe Harbour rules—**which restrain the tax authority from **questioning the pricing of certain transactions** between multinational companies and their subsidiaries.
