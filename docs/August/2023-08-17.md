#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** Governance/ Government Policies and Interventions

**Source:** [**TOI**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/16/impact-of-the-dpdp-bill-on-the-rti-act/#:~:text=The%20Digital%20Personal%20Data%20Protection,by%20retired%20Justice%20B%20N%20Srikrishna.)

 **Context**: This article is in continuation to yesterday’s article on the Impact of the [DPDP Bill on the RTI Act](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/16/impact-of-the-dpdp-bill-on-the-rti-act/#:~:text=The%20Digital%20Personal%20Data%20Protection,by%20retired%20Justice%20B%20N%20Srikrishna.)

Digital Personal Data Protection in India is criticized for granting extensive state control over citizens’ lives and privacy.

**Limitation of the DPDP Bill:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|The bill has an **emphasis on data collection and commercialization,** potentially overshadowing robust protection of citizens’ rights and data privacy.|   |
|**Weak Notice Provision**|**Data collecting companies** (data fiduciaries) are not required to inform users (data principals) about sharing their data with third parties|
|**Consent Issues**|‘Legitimate uses’ of data are **vaguely defined**, potentially leading to **consent-related issues**. E.g., reasons like ‘State functions’ and ‘medical reasons’, do not require user consent, possibly undermining privacy|
|**Government Immunity**|The government is **granted extensive powers** to gather and process citizens’ data.|
|**Compromised Independence**|The Data Protection **Board’s lack of independence** due to government-appointed members|
|**Undefined Data Fiduciary Category**|Unclear criteria for **‘significant data fiduciaries’** exemptions from notifying users about data collection, storage, or sharing|

In September 2018, nearly a year after its decision on the **fundamental right to privacy**, the Supreme Court upheld but also limited the Aadhaar programme. **Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, in his dissenting judgment**, drew from **Nobel Prize-winning author Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn’s experience in Stalinist Russia**: “The invisible threads of a society networked on biometric data had grave portents for the future and unless the law mandates an effective data protection framework, the quest for liberty and dignity would be as ephemeral as the wind.”

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: Social Issues: Health/ Hunger**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/health-wellness/good-nutrition-reduces-tb-incidence-curbs-mortality-says-new-lancet-study-8883097/#:~:text=New%20evidence%20from%20Reducing%20Activation,by%20nearly%2050%20per%20cent.)

 **Context:** New studies published in **The Lancet and The Lancet Global Health journals** provide evidence that **improved nutrition** can significantly **reduce** [**tuberculosis (TB)**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/21/editorial-analysis-a-new-edge-to-the-fight-against-tuberculosis/#:~:text=In%20humans%2C%20TB%20most%20commonly,TB%20germs%20into%20the%20air.) **incidence and mortality** in India.

- The study is backed by India’s [ICMR](https://www.insightsonindia.com/tag/icmr/)

**More about the study:**

The Reducing Activation of Tuberculosis by Improvement of Nutritional Status (**RATIONS**) trial conducted in Jharkhand (the state has a high TB burden) revealed:

- B**etter nutrition among patients with lung TB** can lead to a **40% reduction in all forms of TB and a nearly 50% reduction** in infectious TB
- **Underweight TB** patients who **experience early weight gain** can have their risk of mortality reduced by 60%.
- Nearly 30 households would need to be provided nutritional supplementation to prevent one case of TB

**Significance**: The trials’ findings are particularly significant as **undernutrition has** emerged as a leading risk factor for TB worldwide. These results could have policy implications and contribute to **India’s goal of eliminating TB by 2025**

**What is tuberculosis (TB)?**

[Tuberculosis](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/23/the-road-to-ending-tuberculosis/) (TB) is an infectious disease caused by the **bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis**. It primarily affects the lungs but can also affect other parts of the body.

**Status of TB in India and the world:**

- **As per the WHO Global TB Report 2022**: India’s TB incidence for the year 2021 is 210 per 100,000 population (a decline of over 18% from 2020)
- **India has a large burden of the world’s TB**, with an estimated economic cost of US$100 million lost annually due to this disease.
- **As per the WHO Global TB Report 2022**, TB cases are attributable to five risk factors — undernourishment, HIV infection, alcohol use disorders, smoking and diabetes.

|**Hospitality Industry Neglect**|Negligence of hotels and resorts towards forest disappearance and improper waste disposal.|**Hotels fail to adopt eco-friendly practices,** leading to environmental degradation.|
|**Rivers as Drainage**|**Improper waste disposal in rivers exacerbates flooding** and disrupts river habitats.|   |
|**Policy Perception**|Overemphasis on **tourism’s economic benefits** in policy decisions, neglecting ecological consequences.|   |
|**Tourists’ Impact**|Unaware tourists unintentionally contribute to environmental harm through travel styles, overconsumption and preferences.|   |

**Steps taken to address the Issues:**

### [‘Termination-level Transition’](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/17/termination-level-transition/)

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/climate-change/rising-methane-could-be-a-sign-that-earth-s-climate-is-part-way-through-a-termination-level-transition--91185#:~:text=Climate%20terminations&text=Recorded%20in%20air%20bubbles%20in,likely%20from%20expanding%20tropical%20wetlands.)

The rapid **increase of methane in Earth’s atmosphere** since 2006, driven by **biological emissions** rather than fossil fuel burning, raises concerns about a potential major transition in Earth’s climate.

**What is ‘Termination-level Transition’?**

**A ‘termination-level transition’** refers to a significant and **rapid shift in Earth’s climate** from one state to another, often marking the end of a glacial period and the onset of a warmer interglacial period.

**For example, during past terminations, like Termination II around 131,000 years ago**, Earth’s climate shifted from glaciers in certain regions to warmer conditions, leading to changes in ecosystems and weather patterns.

**What are biological emissions?**

Biological emissions refer to the **release of gases, such as methane and carbon dioxide**, into the atmosphere as a result of natural biological processes.

For example, in the context of methane, biological emissions can occur during processes like **microbial digestion** in the stomachs of ruminant animals (like cows) or the decomposition of organic matter in wetlands.

**About** [**Methane**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/07/new-methane-source/)

It is a **flammable hydrocarbon** used as a global fuel source. However, it also serves as a potent greenhouse gas, **with over 80 times the warming impact** of carbon dioxide within the **first two decades** of its presence in the atmosphere. It has a **shorter atmospheric lifespan than carbon dioxide**. Its main sources include oil and natural gas operations, agricultural practices, coal mining, and waste management.
