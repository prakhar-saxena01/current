### [Kashmir Issue: Historical aspects](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/21/kashmir-issue-historical-aspects/)

#### **GS Paper 1**

 **Syllabus: Post-Independent India**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/kashmir-why-india-went-to-un-what-after-8900842/)

 **Context:** The article delves into the historical complexities of the [Kashmir issue](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/03/25/un-resolution-on-kashmir-in-1947/), particularly focusing on the events surrounding Hari Singh’s accession to India and the subsequent developments.

**Background of Kashmir’s accession to India:**

The princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, ruled by **Maharaja Hari Singh,** was faced with a crucial decision as British colonial rule ended in India in 1947. As part of the partition process, **princely states were given the choice to join India, Pakistan, or remain independent**.

Maharaja Hari Singh’s preference for independence was rooted in his aspiration to maintain a **neutral status for Kashmir**. However, this choice was challenged by various factors, including the **state’s geographical location**, its **religious and ethnic diversity**, and the political pressures of the time.

**The role played by Gurdaspur Division:**

The division of Gurdaspur, a district that held **strategic significance due to its land connectivity to Kashmir**, played a pivotal role. The **Radcliffe Boundary Commission’s** decision to include Gurdaspur in India ensured that there was a **viable land route between India and Kashmir**, which influenced Hari Singh’s ultimate decision to accede to India.

**Tribal incursion:**

In 1947, as tensions between India and Pakistan escalated, **tribal militias backed by Pakistan invaded Kashmir**. Facing a dire security situation, Hari Singh sought India’s military assistance. In return, he agreed to **accede to India**, formalizing the accession with the signing of the [Instrument of Accession](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/12/30/instrument-of-accession/).

**Why did India approach the** [**United Nations for intervention**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/03/25/un-resolution-on-kashmir-in-1947/) **in Kashmir?**

This accession was followed **by military intervention by Indian forces** to counter the tribal invasion and secure Kashmir. However, the **situation continued to be complex.**

In January 1948, **India brought the Kashmir issue before the United Nations Security Council**. India’s contention was that Pakistani infiltrators had occupied parts of Jammu and Kashmir, which had legally acceded to India through the Instrument of Accession signed by Maharaja Hari Singh. India argued that these **infiltrators should be asked to leave the region to restore the status quo.**

**What is UNSC decide?**

The UN proposed a **ceasefire, demilitarization, and a plebiscite** to determine the future of the region. However, the UN’s intervention **did not lead to a resolution of the Kashmir issue**. The ceasefire was implemented, but the **plebiscite never took place** due to disagreements between India and Pakistan over the preconditions, including the withdrawal of forces from the region.

[**Article 370**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/04/constitutional-challenge-to-the-2019-abrogation-of-article-370/#:~:text=What%20is%20Article%20370%3F,affairs%2C%20defence%2C%20and%20communications.)**:**

A significant development was the inclusion of [Article 370 in the Indian Constitution](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/04/constitutional-challenge-to-the-2019-abrogation-of-article-370/#:~:text=What%20is%20Article%20370%3F,affairs%2C%20defence%2C%20and%20communications.) on October 17, 1949, which granted Jammu and Kashmir a **“special status**” within the Union of India. This special status provided the region with **certain autonomy in areas like governance, laws, and citizenship, reflecting a unique arrangemen**t that aimed to accommodate the region’s distinct circumstances.

**After 1954,** as Pakistan strengthened its ties with the United States and both countries signed a military pact, Jawaharlal Nehru, became **more resolute against the idea of a plebiscite** in Kashmir. Meanwhile, the region of Jammu and Kashmir **continued its integration into India’s democratic processes**, participating in the drafting of the Indian Constitution and beyond.

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: International Relations**

**Source:** [**BS**](https://www.business-standard.com/opinion/columns/does-brics-exist-only-because-a-good-acronym-cannot-be-allowed-to-die-123081800644_1.html)**,** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/explained-why-is-the-brics-summit-important-for-india/article67214105.ece#:~:text=For%20India%2C%20this%20BRICS%20summit,Jinping%20at%20the%20BRICS%20meet.)

 **Context:** India is questioning the criteria for Brics membership and seeks clear guidelines for new entrants

**About BRICS:**

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/brics_1.jpg)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/brics_1.jpg)**

**The criteria for eligibility in** [**BRICS**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/01/india-and-brics/)**:**

There is **no formal application process** as such to join BRICS, however, certain eligibility features are considered for new members

- **Economic Size:**g., India had suggested a minimum of $400bn GDP for new members
- **Trade Volume:**g., India had suggested minimum BRICS trade of $50 billion with the new member
- **Emerging Economy Status**: The country should **demonstrate characteristics of an emerging economy**, including growth potential, industrialization, and development trajectory.
- **Political Stability**: Membership often requires the candidate country to have a stable political environment, good diplomatic relations with existing members, and a commitment to democracy.
- **Mutual Consensus**: Existing BRICS members **usually need to reach a consensus** on admitting new members, which is crucial for expansion.

**India’s Stance on the** [**Expansion of BRICS**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/25/editorial-analysis-the-paradox-of-brics-its-new-pathway/)**:**

India has **not been very enthusiastic** about the expansion of **BRICS membership so far**, as it is basically an exercise **initiated by China** to increase its clout in the grouping. “Since almost all other members are now **open to the expansion process**, including Brazil, which wants **Argentina** as a member to increase the weight of Latin America, India has accepted to go on the BRICS expansion plan even with some relaxation in GDP and Trade criteria.

**How is China influencing BRICS?** 

- **Expansion Push:** China advocates for the enlargement of BRICS by encouraging more countries to join, thereby extending the group’s global presence.
- **Diplomatic Strategy**: Due to limited regional allies, China views BRICS as a means to secure broader diplomatic backing, fostering relationships with countries like North Korea, Cambodia, and Myanmar.
- **Countering Western Dominance**: China aims to challenge and diminish Western influence in global affairs through BRICS, using the platform to **counterbalance Western-dominated structures.**
- **Engagement with Other Groups**: China leverages BRICS to engage with other influential groups like the **Shanghai Cooperation Organisation**, which it largely dominates, further enhancing its sway within BRICS.
- **Data Control Concerns**: China’s involvement in the proposed BRICS data cable raises apprehensions regarding its potential control over communication and information flow, leveraging its technological expertise.

**Why is the upcoming BRICS summit important for India?**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Aspect**|**Importance for India**|
|**Geopolitical Significance**|BRICS discussions are perceived to carry a **“counter-western” slant**, which aligns with India’s strategic interests.|
|**Post-Pandemic Recovery**|It provides a platform for BRICS nations to discuss **collaborative efforts for global economic recovery and stability.**|
|**Military Standoff with China**|The summit offers opportunities for bilateral talks on the LAC issue.|
|**Preparation for G20 Summit**|With India hosting the G20 summit shortly after BRICS, the summit provides an occasion for India to **secure full attendance from leaders**, including those from BRICS member states.|
|**Cooperation from China and Russia**|India seeks **increased cooperation from China and Russia** on various issues like the Leader’s declaration content, especially paragraphs on Ukraine, climate change, debt financing, etc.|
|**Expansion of BRICS**|India aims to ensure **consensus on inducting new members**, possibly including countries like Argentina, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Iran.|

**Conclusion:**

BRICS holds **economic importance as China and India** rank within the top five global economies. It also serves as a potential alternative to Western-dominated global systems, offering a distinct voice in international affairs. The inclusion of new members will give more voice to the BRICS.

[**Inflation**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-economy-3/inflation/)**:**

Retail inflation in India **surged to a 15-month high of 7.44% in July**, driven primarily by increased prices of vegetables, cereals, pulses, spices, and milk products. The rise in food prices, especially for **vegetables, cereals, and dairy products**, has contributed to the overall inflationary trend.

**What is inflation?**

Inflation is the rate at which prices rise. A 2% inflation implies the general price level in April this year was 2% more than what it was in April last year.

**Why is inflation bad?**

- It makes commodities costly.
- It essentially erodes the basis on which one makes economic decisions– meaning it reduces the value of money.

**About the report:**

A State of the Economy report by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) provides a snapshot of the **country’s economic status**. It covers topics such as inflation, economic growth, employment, and the bank’s monetary strategies. The report **guides RBI’s decisions** on interest rates and economic policies while aiding economists, investors, and the public in understanding the economy and making informed decisions.

 **Context:** A research paper titled “**A Practical Deep Learning-Based Acoustic Side Channel Attack on Keyboards”** published with the support of **Durham University’s ethics committee reveals that Artificial Intelligence (AI)** can be utilized to **decipher passwords by analysing the sound produced by keystrokes.**

- This method, known as **Acoustic Side Channel Attacks (ASCA)**, exploits the acoustic signals of **keyboard clicks to interpret typed information**.
- Despite being around for decades, **the advancement of AI and deep learning has heightened the risks associated with ASCAs.**
- The accuracy of **ASCAs has been demonstrated through experiments, achieving up to 95% accuracy in recognizing keystrokes** from various sources like **nearby phones and laptop keyboards**.

The paper emphasizes that **users can adopt defence strategies, such as altering typing techniques, using touch-based typing, employing stronger passwords with varied cases and avoiding easily predictable phrases**, to mitigate the threat of ASCAs.

About **Acoustic Side-Channel Attacks:** 

An Acoustic Side Channel Attack (ASCA) is a **type of cybersecurity attack that exploits sound or acoustic signals to gather sensitive information**.

In the context of computer security**, a side channel attack refers to a method where an attacker targets unintended information** leakage or signals emitted by a system, rather than directly attacking the cryptographic algorithms themselves.
