### [Suspensions of Members of Parliament (MPs)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/19/suspensions-of-members-of-parliament-mps/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: GS2- Parliament and State Legislatures**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/illegal-irrational-unconstitutional-the-problem-with-recent-suspensions-of-mps-8892457/)

 **Context:** Recent [suspensions of Members of Parliament (MPs)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/07/27/suspension-of-mps-from-parliament/) have raised concerns about the legality, rationale, and constitutionality of such actions (as per the author).

- **Example**: Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury’s recent suspension in LS; Sanjay Singh and Raghav Chadha (in Rajya Sabha)

**Method of Suspending Members in** [**India’s Parliament:**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/parliament-and-state-legislatures/)

**General Principle of Presiding Officers**

The fundamental principle is that the **Presiding Officer, i.e., the** [**Speaker of Lok Sabha**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/11/26/speaker-of-the-lok-sabha-2/) **and Chairman of Rajya Sabha,** is responsible for maintaining order to ensure the smooth functioning of the House. To uphold proper proceedings, the Speaker/Chairman can compel a member to leave the House if necessary.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Method**|**Process and Rule Used**|
|**Lok Sabha**|**Under** [**Lok Sabha Rule 373**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/07/27/suspension-of-mps-from-parliament/), the Speaker has the authority to instruct a member to **leave the House immediately**. On the Non-compliance of the instruction, the chair names members causing disruptions under **Rule 374**|
|Government introduces **suspension motion**|
|The motion seeks **approval of the House**. If passed, the member is suspended.|
|**Rajya Sabha**|Chair identifies disruptive members under **Rule 256**|
|**A suspension motion was presented** to the House.|
|The motion requires House approval. On approval, the member is **suspended**. The House may, however, by another motion, **terminate the suspension**.|
|**Rule for Suspending**|Rules framed under **Article 118 of the Constitution**. Suspension is based on either **Rule 374** (Lok Sabha) or **Rule 256** (Rajya Sabha).|
|The suspension follows the **established procedure**. It usually **lasts until the end of the ongoing session.**|

**Differences in** [**powers of Speaker**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/03/07/how-an-mp-is-suspended-from-lok-sabha-by-the-speaker/) **and Chairman of Rajya Sabha:**

- **Like the Speaker in Lok Sabha,**the Chairman of Rajya Sabha is empowered under **Rule Number 255 of its Rule Book to** “direct any Member whose conduct is in his opinion grossly disorderly to withdraw immediately” from the House.
- Unlike the Speaker, however, the **Rajya Sabha Chairman does not have the power to suspend a Member.**

**Implications of Suspending Members from India’s Parliament**

- **Disruption to Proceedings**: Suspended members can’t participate, potentially hampering legislative activities.
- **Legal Implications:** The Supreme Court’s 2022 **Ashish Shelar vs Maharashtra Legislative Assembly ruling** declared suspensions beyond rule-prescribed periods unconstitutional.
- **Deviation from Rules:** Recent cases (e.g., Sanjay Singh, Raghav Chadha, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury) show **suspensions exceeding typical limits** or pending investigations, departing from traditional norms.
- **Challenge to Democracy**: Excessive reliance on suspensions might silence opposition voices, impacting democratic debates.
- **Conflict Resolution Need**: Such suspensions underscore the necessity for improved methods to handle disagreements within Parliament.

**Actions for Addressing Parliamentary Suspensions:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Actions**|**Description**|
|**Adhere to Established Rules**|Follow Rules 374 (Lok Sabha) and 256 (Rajya Sabha) meticulously when suspending members.|
|**Avoid Extended Suspensions**|Ensure suspensions don’t exceed the duration of the ongoing session; prolonged suspensions undermine democratic norms.|
|**Review Recent Changes**|Reevaluate recent indefinite suspensions, like Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury’s, to ensure they align with constitutional norms.|
|**Seek Judicial Guidance**|Refer to the Ashish Shelar vs Maharashtra Legislative Assembly (2022) decision to clarify the legality of suspension durations.|
|**Promote Dialogue**|Prioritize dialogue and negotiation among political leaders to address disagreements, reducing the need for suspensions.|

**Conclusion:**

 There is a need to **strike a balance between deliberate disruption** and raising the important issue.

(d) the Government is chosen by the Parliament but cannot be removed by it before the completion of a fixed term

**Answer: B**

A parliamentary system or parliamentary democracy is a system of democratic governance of a state where the executive derives its democratic legitimacy from its ability to command the support of the legislature, typically a parliament, to which it is accountable.

### [Gaps in Registration of Births and Deaths (RBD) Amendment Act](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/19/gaps-in-registration-of-births-and-deaths-rbd-amendment-act/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: Government Policies and Intervention**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/the-gaps-in-the-births-and-deaths-registration-amendment-act/article67206542.ece#:~:text=A%20provision%20could%20have%20been,get%20the%20death%20certificates%20earlier.)

 **Context:** We already [discussed the act before](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/28/registration-of-births-and-deaths-rbd-amendment-bill-2023/), here we do an analysis of the act 

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/RBD.png)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/RBD.png)**

**Critical analysis of the Act:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Aspects**|**Description**|
|**National and State Databases**|The necessity of a **centralized national-level database** is questioned, as State-level databases with data flow could serve the purpose.|
|**Aadhaar Number Collection**|While the Bill mandates collecting [**Aadhaar numbers**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/22/aadhaar-authentication/#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20Aadhaar%20number,individual's%20biometric%20and%20demographic%20data.) **of parents during birth registration,** it lacks provisions for collecting Aadhaar numbers of deceased individuals.<br><br>This omission **creates challenges in updating databases** and achieving transparent service delivery.|
|**Role of Registrar General**|The Bill adds **maintaining the central database to the Registrar General of India’s functions.**<br><br>However, some argue that the role of coordination and unification of registration should be the **primary responsibility of State governments, rendering a national database unnecessary.**|
|**Database Usage and Updates**|The Bill states that the centralized database will update various national-level databases like NPR, electoral rolls, Aadhaar, and more.<br><br>However, the **need for parliamentary approval** and the potential risks of adding databases over time are concerns.|
|**Cause of Death Certificate**|The Bill mandates medical institutions to provide a cause of death certificate.<br><br>Issues arise from instances where a **definite diagnosis isn’t possible before death or where alternative medicine practitioners** may not classify causes according to international standards.|
|**Birth Certificate for Proof**|The Bill suggests using the birth certificate as proof for various purposes such as admissions, passports, and Aadhaar.<br><br>However, some argue that this could be **achieved through amendments** in rules rather than the Act itself.|
|**Missing Persons in Calamities**|The Act lacks provisions for registering “**presumed deaths”** when natural calamities or accidents occur, causing delays in issuing death certificates.<br><br>Inserting such provisions could **aid families in getting death certificates earlier in such cases.**|

**About The [Registration of Births and Deaths (RBD) Act, 1969](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/28/registration-of-births-and-deaths-rbd-amendment-bill-2023/)**

The act makes it **compulsory to register births and deaths in India** based on the location of the event. **State governments are responsible** for the registration process and have established facilities for this purpose. A Chief Registrar in each state oversees the Act’s implementation, with officials at different levels handling the registration process. The Registrar General of India (RGI) coordinates and unifies the Act’s implementation.

 **Context:** The [**Matti banana variety**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/01/gi-tags-in-news/), native to the **Kanniyakumari district** was granted the [**Geographical Indication (GI) tag**,](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/12/29/gi-tag/) and is known for its **unique characteristics that thrive only in the specific climate and soil conditions of its native region.**

- The Matti banana **flourishes due to the area’s special conditions, producing a slightly larger-than-human finger-sized fruit with a sweet fragrance and honey-like taste** that can’t be replicated elsewhere.
- There are **six known types of Matti bananas, each with unique attributes like colour, aroma, and taste.**
- A **hybrid, Semmati, is a mix of Matti and Red banana**, possessing **qualities beneficial for child growth and even suitable for diabetics.**

The uniqueness of the Matti banana is **attributed to a combination of factors including humidity, water, temperature, soil composition, and nutrient balance**.

Experts highlight the significance of the **Genotype-Environment-Microbiome interaction (G×ExM**) **for gene expression**, underscoring the importance of the environment in shaping genetic traits.

**Context: This year marked the third-longest** [**monsoon**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-geography-2/indian-climate/indian-monsoon/) **break of the 21st century, following breaks in 2002 and 2009.**

- The recent break had a **significant impact, causing the all-India cumulative monsoon rainfall anomaly to drop from seven per cent above normal to six per cent** below normal within a short period.

**About** [**Monsoonal Break**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-geography-2/indian-climate/indian-monsoon/characteristics-of-monsoonal-rainfall/#:~:text=The%20monsoon%20rains%20occur%20in,their%20crossing%20into%20the%20mainland.)**:**

- A monsoonal break occurs when the **monsoon trough shifts northward, leading to increased rainfall along the Himalayan foothills and parts of eastern India while suppressing rainfall in other regions.**
- While meteorologically defined, **climatologically, a monsoonal break is declared when the normalized rainfall anomaly index drops below -1 and persists for at least three consecutive days.**

The current monsoon break **was influenced by the developing El Niño and the absence of sub-seasonal weather patterns that support rainfall**.

This prolonged monsoon break is concerning, especially **as it coincides with a ban on rice exports, a crucial Kharif crop.**

 **Context**: The U.K. plans to conduct more fossil fuel drilling in the North Sea, sparking concerns about its alignment with climate goals. The **North Sea Transition Authority (NTSA)** is conducting **offshore oil and gas licensing,** with over **100 licenses expected** to be awarded. This move aims to **enhance energy independence**.

**What is the** [**North Sea**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/02/north-sea/)**?**

Geographically, the North Sea lies between England and Scotland on its west, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France on its south, and Norway, Denmark, and Germany on its East.

**Why is the North Sea important?**

Almost the entire seabed of the **North Sea is a continental shelf**  (depth of only about 200 meters). The geological formations beneath the North Sea, such as **porous rocks and structural traps,** provide suitable environments for the collection of oil and gas reserves.

**Why is offshore drilling problematic?**

Offshore drilling is problematic due to its environmental risks, including threats to marine life, biodiversity, climate change, and ocean ecosystems.

**The 1958 Geneva Convention (which came into force in 1964)** on the Continental Shelf was the first international legislation to establish **the rights of countries over the continental shelves** adjacent to their coastlines and paved the way for exploration in the North Sea.

- These criteria include **restrictions on degrees acquired through distance learning, online learning, and franchise agreements**.
- The guidelines come as **foreign universities establish campuses in India and Indian universities collaborate with international institutions for dual or joint degree programs**.

The UGC’s draft **“Recognition and Grant of Equivalence to Qualifications obtained from Foreign Educational Institutions) Regulations, 2023**” covers various aspects such as internationally relevant curricula, academic collaboration with foreign universities, and credit recognition under twinning arrangements.

**The conditions for recognizing the equivalence of qualifications obtained from foreign institutions include:**

- The foreign institution should **be duly recognized in its home country.**
- The program **must have been pursued through regular, in-person instruction** (not online or distance learning).
- Entry-level requirements for admission **should be similar to corresponding programs in India**.
- The similarity of entry criteria will be evaluated based on factors like **program duration, credit requirements, and evaluation processes.**
- Equivalence of **credit definition (contact hours, self-study hours, etc.) will be established first.**

Qualifications obtained from offshore **campuses under dual or joint degree programs will be recognized if they meet accreditation requirements in both the host country and the country of origi**n.

Qualifications **obtained through franchise arrangements will not be considered for recognition or equivalence**. School-level qualifications obtained from **schools affiliated with foreign boards will be recognized if pursued through regular mode and meet specific criteria.**

 **Context:** India’s Union Health Minister, has stated that the country has initiated the domestic **production of 38** [**active pharmaceutical ingredients**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/05/29/what-are-active-pharmaceutical-ingredients-api/#:~:text=API%20is%20a%20chemical%20compound,from%20body%20ache%20and%20fever.) **(APIs) in the past 1.5 years**

- This achievement has been facilitated through the [**production-linked incentive**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/15/production-linked-incentive-pli-schemes/#:~:text=In%20the%20PLI%20Scheme%2C%20companies,and%20boost%20the%20country's%20economy.) **(PLI) scheme for the pharmaceutical sector**.

 **Context:** Massive wildfires have wreaked havoc in Canada’s Northwest Territories (town of Yellowknife) and Spain’s Tenerife. In Spain, over **3,000 people were evacuated** due to a wildfire that flared up in **Tenerife National Park,** charring a substantial area of the island.

Overall, wildfires have ravaged various parts of the world, including **Northern Africa, Hawaii, Canada, and Europe**.

**Why Canada and other countries in mid to higher latitudes are prone to wildfire?**

Countries like **Canada** and those at mid to **higher latitudes** are prone to wildfires due to factors such as **dry conditions, warmer temperatures, and a buildup of flammable vegetation**. These regions experience **seasonal variations**, including hot and dry summers, which create the **ideal conditions for wildfires** to ignite and spread. Additionally, climate change can **exacerbate these conditions**, making wildfires more frequent and intense.

**Context:** Surgeons at NYU Langone Health have **successfully transplanted a pig’s kidney into a brain-dead man, and the kidney has functioned normally for over a month**.

- This achievement represents the **longest duration a pig kidney has survived and worked inside a human recipient**, even though the patient was deceased.
- In contrast to **past challenges where human immune systems rejected animal organs, genetically modified pigs are now being used to address this issue**.

In 2022, surgeons at the University of Maryland [transplanted **a gene-edited pig heart**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/01/14/pig-heart-transplant/#:~:text=How%20was%20the%20transplantation%20carried,growth%20of%20pig%20heart%20tissue.) **into a terminally ill man, which lasted for two months before failing.**

The **Food and Drug Administration (FDA)** is considering **permitting controlled studies of pig heart and kidney transplants in volunteers,** rather than relying solely on high-risk attempts.
