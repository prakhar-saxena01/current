### [Ancient History: Democracy in India](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/16/ancient-history-democracy-in-india/)

#### **GS Paper 1**

**Syllabus:** **Ancient History**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/democracy-in-india-a-gift-and-a-warning/article67193543.ece#:~:text=Instead%20of%20conceiving%20of%20democracy,can%20also%20be%20snatched%20away.)

 **Context:** In the context of **India’s 76th year of Independence**, the article highlights the debate surrounding the **origins** [**of democracy**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/23/indias-democratic-values-have-eroded-significantly/#:~:text=Largest%20democracy%20%E2%80%93%20A%20government%20of,people%2C%20and%20by%20the%20people.&text=Free%20and%20fair%20elections.&text=Upholding%20democratic%20values%20%E2%80%93%20fundamental%20beliefs,%2C%20inclusiveness%20and%20equality%2C%20etc.) **and India’s claim to being the “mother of democracy**.”

**What is Democracy?**

Democracy is a system of government where power is vested in the hands of the people, allowing them to participate in decision-making through voting and representation.

**The debate:**

Western narrative claims that **democracy was invented in ancient** Athens before being rediscovered and spreading around the globe in modern times.

**While ancient Greece** is often associated with the birth of democracy, India’s historical references to democratic practices challenge this narrative.

**Aspect of Democracy:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Aspect**|**Examples from India’s History**|
|**Early Democratic Practices**|References **in ancient texts like the** [**Rig Veda**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/ancient-indian-history/vedic-age/) **and** [**Buddhist scriptures**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-heritage-culture/religion/buddhism/#:~:text=Its%20scriptures%20are%20in%20Sanskrit,It%20believes%20in%20mantras.) suggest democratic forms of governance in India. The [**Vinay-Pitaka**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-heritage-culture/religion/buddhism/) scripture regulated meetings and voting through a secret ballot system in Buddhist sanghas.|
|**Ancient Republics**|Ancient Indian states like the [**Lichhavis, Mallas, and Vajji**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/ancient-indian-history/mahajanapadas-and-rise-of-magadha/mahajanapadas/) **confederations** were republics with self-governing systems.|
|**Representation and Decision-Making**|Democratic practices **within Gana sanghas** involved decisions taken by members themselves. The governing style was maintained through conventions applicable to these groups.|
|**Democratic Institutions**|The mention of institutions like **sabha, samiti, and sangha in texts indicates** democratic setups, where discussions, resolutions, and equitable resource distribution were emphasized.|
|**Diverse Governance**|The coexistence of various forms of self-governing groups, such as **warrior formations, religious fraternities, and economic organizations**, showcased diverse democratic models in different contexts.|
|**Recognition by Historians**|Greek historian **Diodorus Siculus** mentioned India’s independent and democratic republics, indicating external acknowledgement of democratic systems in ancient India.|
|**Parallel Evolution**|Just as Greek democracy evolved independently**, Indian democracy evolved through ancient republics and assemblies**. Indian democracy’s roots are as ancient as those of Greek democracy.|

**Conclusion:**

Despite historic roots, flaws in the system, such as the exclusion of certain groups, discrimination, and weak political rights exist. There is a need of protecting democracy, as gifts like democracy can also be vulnerable to erosion.

### [Impact of the DPDP Bill on the RTI Act](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/16/impact-of-the-dpdp-bill-on-the-rti-act/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: Governance/ Government Policies and Interventions**

**Source:** [**BBC**](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-66458480)

 **Context:** The recently **passed** [**Digital Personal Data Protection Bill**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/08/data-protection-bill-content-concerns/#:~:text=The%20Digital%20Personal%20Data%20Protection%20Bill%20must%20ensure%20that%20individuals,21%20of%20the%20Indian%20constitution.) in India has raised concerns among **privacy experts due to its potential impact on the landmark right to information (RTI)** law.

**Major Provision of the New Bill:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Aspect**|**Details**|
|**The Digital Personal Data Protection Bill 2022 (DPDP)** **is India’s new law aimed at regulating the collection, storage, and processing of personal data, based on the recommendation of the committee led by retired Justice B N Srikrishna.**|   |
|**Personal Data**|**Personal data** **is any data by which or in relation to which an individual can be identified E.g., Name, address**|
|**Rights of Individuals on Personal Data**|**Individual** **consent** **is required for collection and Processing. Individuals also have the** **right to withdraw consent and demand the erasure of data**|
|**The bill mandates that individuals can access essential information in languages listed in the Indian Constitution’s eighth schedule.**|
|**The 2022 Bill outlines seven principles:**|**1.**      **Usage of personal data must be lawful, fair, and transparent.**<br><br>**2.**      **Personal data should be used only for its intended purposes.**<br><br>**3.**      **Data minimization** **is emphasized.**<br><br>**4.**      **Data accuracy** **during collection is crucial.**<br><br>**5.**      **Personal data shouldn’t be stored indefinitely; limited storage duration is mandated.**<br><br>**6.**      **Safeguards must prevent unauthorized data collection or processing.**<br><br>**7.**      **Accountability** **lies with the entity determining data processing purpose and means**|
|**Data Principle and Data Fiduciary**|**The bill defines “Data Principal” as the individual whose data is collected, “Data Fiduciary” (e.g., Facebook) as the entity controlling data processing, and acknowledges parents/ guardians as “Data Principals” for children under 18.**|
|**Creation of an Independent Regulator**|**‘Significant Data Fiduciaries’** **handle substantial personal data and will be designated by the Central government based on specific criteria. They must appoint a ‘Data Protection Officer’ and an independent Data Auditor.**|
|**Cross-Border Data Transfer**|**The bill permits cross-border data transfer to specified countries with strong data security measures, where the Indian government can access Indians’ data. This is a departure from the previous bill, which mandated local data storage requirements.**|
|**Grievance Redressal**|**Establish a Data Protection Board for enforcing compliance. If Data Fiduciary’s response is unsatisfactory, consumers can file complaints with this Board.**|
|**Penalties**|**Entities lacking “reasonable security safeguards” against data breaches face fines of up to Rs 250 crore. The proposed Data Protection Board could levy penalties of up to ₹500 crore for substantial non-compliance.Top of Form**|
|**Exemptions**|**The bill offers exemptions (by the government) for businesses based on user numbers and data volume, addressing concerns from startups about compliance burden. National security and government agency exemptions are retained, safeguarding India’s interests.**|
|**Non-Personal Data**|**The bill mandates providing non-personal data to the government when demanded.**|

**The Digital Personal Data Protection Bill impacts the** [**Right to Information (RTI) Act**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/governance/governance-important-aspects/transparency/right-to-information-act/#:~:text=It%20was%20the%20Supreme%20Court,concept%20of%20freedom%20of%20speech.) **in the following ways:**

- **Exemption of Personal Information**: The new data protection law changes a provision in the RTI Act to exempt “**personal information” from being disclosed**. This affects information sought under the RTI law.
- **Impact on Transparency:** Activists and experts are concerned that the change will reduce transparency and hinder the ability to access information.
- **Blanket Ban on Personal Information**: The new law introduces a blanket ban on personal information, making it difficult to access information even if it relates to **public activities or larger public interest**.
- **Increased Denials**: Officials are expected to deny more RTI requests using the personal information exemption, affecting the availability of crucial information.
- **Exception Burden**: While the change doesn’t affect the provision allowing access if **public interest outweighs the harm**, it shifts the burden to individuals seeking information to **prove its public interest**.

### [NEET & Tamil Nadu’s Protest](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/16/neet-tamil-nadus-protest/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: Federalism/ Government Policies**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/behind-tn-vs-centre-over-neet-a-larger-equity-federalism-battle-8892918/#:~:text=The%20Committee's%20report%2C%20'Impact%20of,discriminated%20against%20first%2Dtime%20applicants.)

 **Context:** The conflict between Tamil Nadu and the Central government over NEET has broader implications related to equity and federalism

**What is** [**NEET**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/tag/neet-exam/)**?**

**NEET (National Eligibility Entrance Test)** is the qualifying test for MBBS and BDS programs in Indian medical and dental colleges. It was introduced to standardize admissions across the country.

**Tamil Nadu’s Opposition: Tamil Nadu has been vehemently opposing NEET, citing various issues:**

- **Adverse Effects**: A committee led by Justice **K. Rajan found that NEET negatively impacted the share of seats** historically enjoyed by Tamil Nadu Board of Secondary Examination (TNBSE) students.
- **Favoured CBSE Students**: NEET favoured Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) students over TNBSE students, creating an imbalance.
- **Coaching Dependency**: NEET led to a surge in the coaching industry, shifting focus from learning to exam preparation.
- **Social Inequality**: Repeated attempts to crack NEET disproportionately benefited **financially and socially privileged students**, excluding marginalized backgrounds.
- **Economic Disparities:** Merit-based admissions in state-run institutions contrasted with economically advantaged students getting admissions in private colleges based on poor NEET scores.
- **Exam Conduct Issues:** Discrepancies in exam conduct, including impersonation cases, raised concerns about the fairness of the exam.

**Tamil Nadu attempted legislative actions to counter NEET:** 

**In 2017**, the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly passed bills aiming to exempt the state from NEET-based admissions, but these bills were not granted approval by the President. In 2021, a new bill was introduced to admit students to **MBBS/BDS courses solely** **based on Class XII** **board scores**, bypassing NEET. **In 2022, after the Governor returned the bill**, it was readopted by the Assembly and sent back to the Governor. Currently, the bill is awaiting consideration by the Ministry of Home Affairs.

[Can states refuse to implement Central laws?](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/12/18/can-states-refuse-to-implement-central-laws-2/&ved=2ahUKEwjO_-65o4DzAhXzwTgGHWOFD6IQFnoECAUQAQ&usg=AOvVaw3mEw8J_O0tk_Vx2fu4eIhK)

- Usually, when a state wants to **amend a Central law made under one of the items in the concurrent list,**it needs the clearance of the Centre.
- **When a state law contradicts a Central law**on the same subject, the law passed by Parliament prevails.

**Why has the Constitution envisaged such an arrangement?**

This is an arrangement envisaged as **most Parliament laws apply to the whole of India and states amending the Central laws indiscriminatel**y could lead to inconsistencies in different regions on the application of the same law. In matters of trade and commerce, this could especially pose serious problems.

**The other options available with the states are:**

- To take the Centre to the Supreme Court over the validity of these laws.
- [**Article 131**](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/01/20/discuss-the-significance-of-article-131-of-the-indian-constitution-can-states-challenge-the-validity-of-central-laws-under-it-justify-your-stand-with-suitable-examples/&ved=2ahUKEwjdw6nBo4DzAhUkxzgGHcQlC1IQFnoECAcQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2KNdGWeNPcA-agrAq_b6TN)**of the Constitution** provides exclusive jurisdiction to the Supreme Court to adjudicate matters between the states and the Centre.
- **Article 254 (2) of the Constitution** empowers state governments to pass legislation which negates the Central acts in the matters enumerated under the Concurrent List.
    - **State legislation passed under Article 254 (2)**requires the assent of the President of India.

**Way forward:**

**The complex issue of NEET and its impact on Tamil Nadu’s education system** requires a balanced solution that **addresses both equity concerns and the preservation of regional values**.

**To resolve this matter, a multi-pronged approach could be considered.**

- First, there should be a **comprehensive review of the NEET examination process** to ensure that it fairly evaluates students’ aptitude and knowledge rather than solely relying on marks.
- Second, **alternative admission criteria that account for socioeconomic backgrounds** and contextual factors should be explored, enabling a more diverse pool of students to access medical education.
- Third, efforts should be made to **enhance the quality of education in state-run institutions**, providing students with the necessary skills to excel in competitive exams.
- Additionally, the central government and state authorities could **collaborate to establish a transparent and inclusive framework** for medical admissions that combines elements of **standardization and local autonomy**.

 **Varsha Sharma,** a farmer from Himachal Pradesh, India, has faced challenges due to erratic rainfall and water diversion for industries, **impacting her rice farming**. She shifted to hybrid rice varieties and apple cultivation, but the **hybrid rice required excessive additives** that damaged the soil.

In 2018, **she turned to red rice, a** [**traditional variety**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/03/11/insights-into-editorial-uahs-develops-new-paddy-variety-resistant-to-blast-disease/) **that thrives without chemicals and fertilizers (completely Organic)**, offering better nutrition and organic qualities. Red rice also commands a good **price in the market**, making it a favourable choice for many farmers.

Himachal Pradesh’s government **aims to expand red rice cultivation to 4,000 hectares**. The resurgence of traditional rice varieties like **red rice is transforming farming practices** in India, with indigenous seeds **proving resilient and sustainable.**

 **Context**: Former United States **President** [**Donald Trump**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Implications-of-Donald-Trump%E2%80%99s-presidency-for-India.pdf) **and 18 allies face charges**, including the **“Violation of the Georgia RICO** (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations) Act”.
