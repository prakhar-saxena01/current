#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: Indian Federalism, Centre-State Relations**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/delhi-services-bill-introduced-in-lok-sabha-amid-opposition-protest-8871222/)

 **Context:** The Government of [National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/27/the-national-capital-territory-of-delhi-amendment-ordinance-2023/), 2023, was introduced in the Lok Sabha, leading to opposition protests and debates.

**About the Bill**:

The bill aimed to replace **the National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Ordinance,** 2023, which deals with the **control of services in Delhi**.

**Background of the Issue:** 

The Delhi government and Lieutenant Governor have been in a **legal battle since 2015** over control of “services” in Delhi. The Supreme Court **gave a split verdict in 2019**, and a five-judge Constitution Bench recently (May 2023) granted more powers to the Delhi government over services. It ordered that the **Delhi government will have control over administrative services** other than matters related to public order, police, and land.

To counter it, the central government passed the **National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Ordinance,** 2023. The ordinance excluded “**services”** from the purview of the Delhi legislature and **conferred LG with more powers**. It will now be replaced by the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2023.

**Key features of the new bill:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Aspect**|**Description**|
|**Purpose**|To amend certain provisions of the Government of **NCT of Delhi Act, 1991.**|
|**Establishment of NCCSA**|Introduces the **National Capital Civil Services Authority (NCCSA)** to provide recommendations to the LG on service matters.|
|**Composition of NCCSA**|NCCSA consists of the **Chief Minister of Delhi (Chairperson),** Principal Home Secretary, and Chief Secretary of the Delhi Govt.|
|**Empowerment of Central Govt.**|Central Govt. empowered to **make rules regarding the** Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi**’s** affairs, officer & employee functions, terms, and conditions.|
|**Discretionary Power to LG**|LG granted **discretionary power over matters beyond Delhi Assembly’s competence** or requiring judicial/quasi-judicial action.|

**Concerns regarding the bill:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Concerns**|**Description**|
|**Centralization of Power**|Critics argue that the Bill centralizes power in the hands of the LG, diminishing the elected government’s authority.|
|**Bypassing the Legislative Assembly**|Opponents claim that the Bill bypasses the elected Legislative Assembly’s decision-making role.|
|**Impact on Cooperative Federalism**|Critics argue that the bill is undermining the democratic mandate and interfering with local governance.|
|**Potential for Conflict**|Some fear that discretionary power given to LG could lead to conflicts between the elected govt. and LG.|
|**Constitutional Validity**|Questions arise about the **constitutional validity of the Bill and its alignment with federal principles.**|
|**Curtailing Delhi Government’s Autonomy**|Critics worry that the Bill might curtail the autonomy of the Delhi government in policy-making.|

**How UTs are administered?**

[The Union Territories](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/functions-and-responsibilities-of-the-union-and-the-states-issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure-devolution-of-powers-and-finances-up-to-local-levels-and-challenges-therein/functions-and-responsibilities-of-the-union-and-the-states/) (Uts) in India are administered by **the President** through an **appointed administrator**, who represents the President and exercises administrative powers in the UT. In some Uts, such as **Delhi and Puducherry**, the administrator holds significant powers, including the ability to make laws and regulations for the UT, while in others, the administrator’s powers are limited to **providing advice to the elected government**.

**Special provision for Delhi UT:**

Special provisions have been made for certain Uts, such as **Puducherry, Delhi, and Jammu and Kashmir (yet to be constituted)**, which have a **legislative assembly and a Council of Ministers headed by a Chief Minister**. The legislative assembly of these Uts has the power to make laws with respect to matters enumerated in **List II or List III in the Seventh Schedule** of the Constitution insofar as these matters are applicable in relation to the UT.

However, **some entries in List II, such as public order, police, and land**, are not within the legislative competence of the legislative assembly of Delhi.

### [Mental health issues in Security forces](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/03/mental-health-issues-in-security-forces/)

#### **GS2/GS1/GS4 Paper** 

 **Syllabus: Social Issues/ Indian Society / Ethics**

**Source:** [**TOI**](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-editorials/killer-on-the-train/)

 **Context:** An RPF jawan (on the **Jaipur-Mumbai Superfast Express**) with mental health issues shot and killed passengers, prompting questions about having armed troubled personnel on duty

**What is** [**mental health**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/10/11/address-stigma-in-mental-health/)**?**

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), mental health is a state of well-being in which the **individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully**, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community.

**Status of issue:**

- The suicide rate in the **Indian Army** is about 8.5 suicides per 100000 people

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Reasons for Prevalence of Mental Health Issues in Uniformed Forces**|   |
|**Tightly Structured Hierarchy**|Command-and-control hierarchy system|
|Senior officer as reporting authority|
|Lack of platform for communicating personal issues|
|**Stress is not Addressed**|Signs of stress are often ignored|
|Fear of being perceived as weak|
|Pressure to conform to “macho” stereotype|
|**Less Recognition for Achievements**|Lack of recognition for constabulary|
|Frequent persecution for failures|
|**Tendency towards Alcoholism**|Resorting to alcohol/drug abuse for coping|
|**Lack of Awareness and Stigma**|Lack of awareness about mental health issues|
|The stigma around seeking help for mental health concerns|
|**Separation from Family and Home**|Being away from family for extended periods|
|Isolation and loneliness due to duty demands|
|**Job-related Stress and Trauma**|Exposure to traumatic events|
|High-stress nature of duties|
|**Poor Working Conditions**|Meagre salary and inadequate facilities|
|Lack of timely leaves and allowances|

**Some key measures to address mental health issues among uniformed forces:**

- **Awareness and Training**: Conduct regular awareness campaigns and training programs to educate personnel and superiors about mental health, its signs, and the importance of seeking help.
- **De-Stigmatization:** Work towards creating a culture where seeking mental health support is encouraged and not stigmatized, challenging stereotypes of strength and vulnerability.
- **Access to Counseling:** Establish confidential counselling services accessible to all personnel, providing a safe space for them to discuss their concerns and receive professional guidance.
- **Leadership Involvement**: Involve senior officers in mental health initiatives, encouraging open communication, understanding, and proactive support for struggling personnel.
- **Early Intervention:** Develop a system for early identification of mental health issues through regular assessments, screenings, and peer support mechanisms.
- **Promote Work-Life Balance**: Implement policies that ensure adequate leaves, balanced work hours, and opportunities for personnel to connect with their families and loved ones.
- **Wellness Programs:** Offer wellness programs that focus on stress reduction, resilience-building, mindfulness, and coping strategies to enhance mental well-being.
- **Crisis Response**: Develop protocols for responding to crisis situations, including access to immediate psychological support for personnel involved in traumatic incidents.
- **Peer Support Networks:** Establish peer support networks where personnel can openly share their experiences, provide mutual assistance, and foster a sense of camaraderie.
- **Family Support**: Recognize the role of families in supporting personnel’s mental health; provide resources and counselling to families to help them understand and address these issues.
- **Inclusive Policies**: Tailor policies and interventions to the diverse needs of personnel, considering factors like gender, age, cultural backgrounds, and ranks.

**The government has taken several steps to improve mental health:**

- **Constitutional Provision**: Recognized healthcare as a fundamental right under Article 21.
- [**Mental HealthCare Act 2017**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/tag/mental-healthcare-act-2017/): Ensured access to mental healthcare from government-funded services, reduced use of **Section 309 IPC** (suicide attempt), and focused on treatment.
- [**National Mental Health Program**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/10/04/mental-health-at-work/) **(NMHP):** Addressed mental disorders and the shortage of professionals since 1982, including modernization of mental hospitals and upgrading psychiatric wings.
- **Kiran Helpline:** Launched a 24/7 toll-free helpline to provide support for anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, and more.
- **Manodarpan**: Launched under Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan to offer psychosocial support for students, families, and teachers during the Covid-19 pandemic.

**Conclusion:**

Addressing mental health issues in uniformed forces is crucial for both the well-being of personnel and the effectiveness of their roles. In this context, **Regular sampark sabhas** need to be conducted where **personnel can air their grievances and proper follow-up action** must be taken on all **possible issues**.

**How India’s growing economy is having a positive effect on South Asia?**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Aspect**|**Description**|
|**Economic Growth**|India’s economy is growing and poised to become the third-largest economy.|
|**Trade Volumes**|Intra-regional trade grew from **2% in 1990 to 6% now (but compared to ASEAN countries ( over 27% integration, it is still low)**|
|**Bilateral Trade Potential**|India’s exports: **$16 billion to Bangladesh, $6 billion** to Sri Lanka, and over $8 billion to Nepal in 2022.|
|**Cross-Border Connectivity**|Major initiatives for cross-border connectivity are complementing trade volumes e.g., trains and bus services with Bangladesh, Nepal|
|**Economic Reform**|Economic crises in countries like Sri Lanka and Pakistan are pushing for serious economic change.|
|**Openness to Trade and Investment**|Nepal and Sri Lanka are more open to trade, investment, and connectivity with India.|
|**Global Power Rivalry Influence**|US-China rivalry and India- China conflict have altered the **Subcontinent’s geo-economic dynamics.**|
|**Support for Regionalism**|Western nations are supporting **India-centered regionalism** and economic **integration in the region.**|
|**Transformational Potential**|These factors combined could potentially transform South Asia’s economic landscape.|

**South Asian regional integration can overcome political disputes:**

- **Economic Interdependence**: As trade benefits economies, it encourages nations to resolve political issues.
- **Sub-Regional Initiatives:**g., BMIC, India-Mynmmar trilateral highway, SAFTA.
- **People-to-People Contacts:** Promoting cultural exchanges, educational programs, and tourism can help build positive relationships among citizens across borders.
- **Shared Challenges:** Addressing common challenges like climate change, terrorism, and natural disasters requires cooperation.
- **Diplomatic Engagement**: Confidence-building measures, trust-building initiatives, and regular dialogues can help ease tensions.
- **Economic Incentives**: Japan’s effort in promoting India-Bangladesh connectivity

**India can lead South Asia’s development by:**

- Boosting regional trade, connectivity, and investment.
- Providing an ecological blueprint for biodiversity protection and climate response.
- Focusing on regional food security and supply chains.
- Promoting sub-regional initiatives for cooperation.
- Representing South Asian interests in international forums.

**Conclusion:**

Together the three trends — the region’s new economic openness, India’s vigorous neighbourhood policies, and Western support for an **India-centred regionalism in South Asia** — could transform the **Indian subcontinent’s geo-economic landscape**. India’s rising economic tide could help lift all boats in South Asia.

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://epaper.thehindu.com/ccidist-ws/th/th_delhi/issues/46052/OPS/GFVBIGE48.1+G9IBIH84I.1.html)

**Context**: The article highlights the **limitations of temperature estimates** from before the invention of thermometers, based on **“palaeo proxies**.” It calls the claims that a specific day was the **warmest in over 100,000 years as scientifically unfounded.**

**What are Palaeo proxies?**

Palaeo proxies, short for paleoclimate proxies, are indirect pieces of evidence that scientists use to infer past climate conditions. **Since instrumental climate records** (such as thermometer measurements) are only available for a relatively short period, usually a few hundred years, scientists rely on various natural sources to reconstruct climate conditions over longer timescales.

To estimate past temperatures, **scientists also use isotopes that undergo steady radioactive decay**.

**Limitations of these techniques?** 

**Palaeo proxy** technique has limitations. **It can only provide temperature anomalies on long timescales, such as centuries or thousands of years**. Even the best proxies only offer estimates on weekly or seasonal timescales. Additionally**, all temperature proxies are local or regional, making global temperature estimates uncertain.**

**Significance:**

- **The proxies can help in understanding the response of modern humans to climate change**. However, **such proxies are not suitable for estimating daily temperatures.**
- Climate change is best understood over longer timescales, and **making alarmist claims about daily records can jeopardize the credibility of climate action efforts.**

 **Context:** Israeli courts have invoked the reasonableness doctrine to scrutinize political appointments and executive decisions.

**What is The doctrine of ‘reasonableness’?**

 The ‘reasonableness doctrine is a **legal principle used to evaluate the validity of administrative decisions**. It assesses whether a decision is **extremely unreasonable,** based on factors like the consideration of relevant information, proper balancing of factors, and absence of irrelevant influences.

**If a decision lacks these qualities, it can be invalidated.**

For instance, if a government decision allocates resources without adequately considering the impact on citizens’ well-being, or if a political appointment is made without proper evaluation of the candidate’s qualifications, the ‘reasonableness’ doctrine can be used to challenge and overturn such decisions.

**Indian context:**

India has a ‘**Doctrine of Non-Arbitrariness and Reasonable Classification’** originating from Article 14 (fundamental right to equality to every citizen in the country)

 **Context:** The **Justice G. Rohini Commission**, tasked with [**sub-categorising Other Backward Classes (OBC) caste groups**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/07/15/commission-to-examine-the-issue-of-sub-categorization/), has submitted its report to **the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment after nearly six years.**

- **Formed in 2017** and led by former **Delhi High Court Chief Justice G. Rohini**, **the commission aimed to examine the concentration of reservation and benefits among dominant OBC caste groups**.
- Based on its findings, **the commission was to suggest a breakdown of the over 2,600 caste groups on the Central OBC list to ensure a more equitable redistribution of benefits.**

Although the report is not out,   the commission’s recommendations may involve **categorizing the caste groups into broad categories, with the dominant castes receiving the smallest share of the 27% reservation**, and historically marginalized groups getting a larger share.

**Context**: The [WHO](https://www.insightsonindia.com/international-relations/important-international-institutions-agencies-and-further-structure-mandate-etc/who/) has recognized the effectiveness of polypills in combating cardiovascular diseases by including them in the Model Lists of Essential Medicines.

**What are Polypills?**

A polypill is a **single pill that contains a combination of multiple medications**, typically used for the prevention or treatment of various health conditions. It simplifies medication regimens by packaging several drugs together in a single dosage form.

**Example:**

“**Polycap**,” which is a polypill containing multiple medications, including **simvastatin** (for cholesterol control), **ramipril** (for blood pressure control), **atenolol** (for heart health), **hydrochlorothiazide** (for blood pressure control), and **acetylsalicylic** acid (aspirin for clot prevention).

**Significance**: Polypills are designed to simplify treatment regimens, enhance medication adherence, and provide an effective approach to managing complex health conditions by combining multiple medications into a single dosage form.

[**WHO Model Lists of Essential Medicines**](https://www.who.int/groups/expert-committee-on-selection-and-use-of-essential-medicines/essential-medicines-lists): The WHO Model Lists of Essential Medicines are updated **every two years** by the Expert Committee on Selection and Use of Essential Medicines.

### [Massive extinct whale ‘may be the heaviest animal that ever lived’](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/03/massive-extinct-whale-may-be-the-heaviest-animal-that-ever-lived/)

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/massive-extinct-whale-may-be-heaviest-animal-that-ever-lived/article67152760.ece)

**Context:** Scientists have **described a new contender for the heaviest animal ever to live, named Perucetus colossus or “the colossal whale from Peru**.”

- Fossils of this **ancient giant were discovered in the Ica desert in Peru, and researchers estimate that it lived around 39 million years ago**.
- This prehistoric whale weighed between 94 and 375 tons (85 and 340 metric tons), making it potentially **heavier than the largest blue whales, which typically weigh around 200 tons** (180 metric tons).
- One reason for its **higher weight is its dense and heavy bones compared to those of modern blue whales**. This density suggests that the ancient whale may have lived **in shallow coastal waters, similar to other coastal dwellers like manatees.**

Whales are a widely distributed and **diverse group of fully aquatic placental marine mammals**. The **sperm whale** is the largest-toothed predator on Earth. The Blue Whale, Balaenoptera musculus, is listed as **‘Endangered’** on the IUCN Red List of Threatened SpeciesTM.
