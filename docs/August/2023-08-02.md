### [Impact of Climate Change on Children](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/02/impact-of-climate-change-on-children/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: Social Justice/ Indian Society**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/climate-change/climate-change-contributes-to-violence-against-children-here-s-how-90950#:~:text=Natural%20hazards%2C%20combined%20with%20large,to%20higher%20risks%20of%20violence.)

 **Context:** A recent study has highlighted how **climate change contributes** to violence against children.

**How climate change contributes to violence against children?**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Aspect**|**Description**|
|**Hazards and Disaster Risk**|Natural disasters create **stressful environments, leading to higher risks of violence against children** in relief shelters or at home. In post-disaster situations, children might be forced into labour for recovery efforts.|
|**Gender**|Climate change can exacerbate **child marriage in certain regions** due to drought-induced economic pressures, affecting girls disproportionately.|
|**Mobility and Immobility**|Climate migrants face **increased risks of violence, and separation from families or caregivers** makes children vulnerable. Immobility, as in slum areas, can lead to child abuse and violence.|
|**Child Labor**|Natural disasters and **climate-change-related industries** (agriculture, mining, etc.) contribute to child labour, which can expose children to exploitation and violence.|
|**Health**|Climate-related mental health issues can lead to **increased perpetration of violence against children**, as **eco-anxiety and fear of consequences** contribute to domestic violence.<br><br>As temperatures rise, **infants will bear the greatest burden of malnutrition and rising food prices.**<br><br>Children will suffer most from the rise in **infectious diseases.**|

**Addressing violence against children due to climate change requires a multi-faceted approach:**

- **Integrated Policies:** Develop **context-specific policies** that recognize the link between climate change and violence against children.
- **Early Warning Systems**: Establish early warning systems for **climate-related disasters that specifically consider children’s vulnerabilities**.
- **Psychosocial Support**: Offer counselling, play therapy, and mental health services to help children cope with anxiety and stress.
- **Gender-Sensitive Interventions**: Focus on preventing child marriage, human trafficking, and gender-based violence exacerbated by climate change.
- **Climate-Resilient Education**: Integrate climate change awareness and preparedness into school curricula to empower children with knowledge and skills to face climate-related challenges.
- **Child-Centred Disaster Plans**: Develop and implement disaster preparedness plans that specifically address the needs and vulnerabilities of children during extreme weather events.
- **Child-Centred Shelters**: Design and set up shelters that prioritize the safety and well-being of children during emergencies.

### [NITI Aayog: Towards Decarbonising Transport 2023](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/02/niti-aayog-towards-decarbonising-transport-2023/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus: Environment Conservation**

**Source:** [**NITI Aayog**](https://www.niti.gov.in/sites/default/files/2023-07/98_Towards_Decarbonising_Transport_2023_compressed.pdf)

 **Context:** NITI Aayog released the “**Towards Decarbonising Transport 2023″** report to support global discussions on sustainable transport during India’s G20 presidency.

**What is Decarbonising Transport?**

[Decarbonising Transport](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/25/decarbonising-transport-sector/) refers to the **process of reducing or eliminating carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector**.

**Examples**: Promoting electric vehicles, using alternative fuels, improving energy efficiency, and investing in public transport and active mobility.

**Status of emission from the transport sector:**

- As of 2021, the transport sector in India **contributes to around 14-15% of the country’s** total greenhouse gas emissions.
- Within the transport sector**, road transport contributes to more than 90%** of the total CO2 emissions.
- India has the target to achieve [**net-zero emissions by 2070**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/11/02/india-will-achieve-net-zero-emissions-by-2070/#:~:text=India%20will%20achieve%20net%20zero%20emissions%20latest%20by%202070.,GDP%20by%20less%20than%2045%25.)**.**

**Key Highlights of the Report:**

- India has still **no overall emissions or energy targets** for the transport sector
- India’s transport-sector emissions could increase **65% by 2030 and 197% by 2050 (from** 2020 levels)
- **Contributor**s: Road > Rail transport

**Recommendations of the Report:**

The success of “**Decarbonising Transport**” rests on both a **“mobility transition” and an “energy transition in transport”.**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Recommendation**|**Explanation**|**Example**|
|**1. Increase Reliance on Zero-Carbon Electricity**|The transition towards using renewable energy sources for powering transport.|Installing **more charging stations for electric vehicles** and promoting the use of renewable energy in public transportation systems.|
|**2. Market Ramp-Up of Power-to-X Fuels**|**Develop and invest in the production of carbon-neutral alternatives** for energy-dense fuels used in long-haul aviation and maritime shipping.|G20 countries collaborating to fund research and development of **power-to-X fuel production techniques and facilities.**|
|**3. Eliminate Fossil-Fuel Subsidies**|Phase out subsidies that favour carbon-intensive transport modes, redirecting resources towards sustainable alternatives.|**Ending subsidies on gasoline prices and reallocating** the saved funds to improve public transportation infrastructure and support EV adoption.|
|**4. “Avoid, Shift, Improve” strategy**|**It focuses on three main actions:** **avoiding** unnecessary trips, **shifting** to more sustainable modes of transport, and **improving** the energy efficiency of vehicles and transportation systems.|Many companies are adopting remote work options for their employees|

**Context:** In 2023, India experienced **157 days of plastic overshoot**, which means that the country generated and accumulated a significant **amount of plastic waste** that exceeded its waste management capacity.

Also, in another news, a recent report highlights that **India is one of the 12 countries accountable for 52%** of the global mismanaged plastic waste, alongside nations like China, Brazil, Indonesia, and the United States.

**What is Plastic Overshoot Day?**

Plastic Overshoot Day marks the **point in a year when the amount of plastic waste generated exceeds the capacity** to properly manage and dispose of it. It signifies a **tipping point where the world accumulates more plastic waste** than can be effectively handled by waste management systems.

**World’s first Plastic Overshoot Day on July 28, 2023, was marked recently**.

**Status of Plastic (as per the Report):**

- India has Mismanaged Waste Index (MWI) (ratio of the mismanaged waste and the total waste) of **over 98%**
- **India categorized as ‘The Waste Sponges’**: It contributed a staggering over **73 lakh ton** of mismanaged plastic waste in 2023
- India has a **relatively low annual per capita plastic consumption** of **5.****3 kg (USA has 221 kg)**
- **1.33 %** of its total plastic waste was imported, while the country **exported 0.8 %** of its total waste
- India will contribute an **average of 16.7 days** of plastic overshoot to the environment in 2023.

**Measures Needed:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Measure**|**Example**|
|**Reduce Single-Use Plastics**|Ban on plastic straws and cutlery|
|**Promote Recycling and Circular Economy**|Implementing bottle deposit return systems|
|**Improve Waste Collection and Management**|Increasing the number of recycling bins|
