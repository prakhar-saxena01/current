### [Casteism in Indian Society](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/22/casteism-in-indian-society/)

#### **GS Paper 1**

 **Syllabus: Indian Society: Caste**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/dont-pretend-not-to-see-caste-to-fight-it-acknowledge-existence-8901002/)

 **Context: The article discusses t**he need to acknowledge the existence of caste in Indian society is crucial for achieving true equality and inclusion.

**What is** [**casteism**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/society/salient-features-of-indian-society/challenges-faced-by-indian-society/caste-system/#:~:text=Pure%20caste%20is%20ranked%20at,purity%20of%20specific%20caste%20groups.)**?**

Casteism is a social system **characterized by the hierarchical division of society** based on caste, resulting in discrimination, inequality, and unequal access to opportunities for individuals belonging to different castes.

**Efforts to eliminate caste-based discrimination in India:**

- **Constitutional Provisions:** [Articles 15 and 17](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/indian-constitution/significant-provisions/fundamental-rights/fundamental-rights-articles-12-35/) specifically address the prohibition of discrimination based on caste.
- **Reservation Policies:** have been implemented to provide historically disadvantaged castes with better access to education, jobs, and political representation. E.g. **Article 330 and Article 332**
- **Legal Framework:** Laws like the [**Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/02/11/supreme-court-upholds-changes-to-sc-st-atrocities-law/)**, 1989,** provide protection against violence and discrimination faced by marginalized communities.
- **Awareness Campaigns:** Public awareness campaigns, workshops, and seminars are conducted to sensitize society.
- **Social Movements:** Various social reform movements, led by activists, organizations, and leaders, have aimed to challenge and change traditional caste-based norms and practices.

Despite the above efforts, **caste-based discrimination continues to persist in Indian society due to the following reasons:**

- **Historical Legacy:** Historical injustices and inequalities continue to influence perceptions and behaviours, leading to the perpetuation of discriminatory practices.
- **Cultural Norms and Traditions**: Social practices, rituals, and inter-caste marriage restrictions reinforce caste-based distinctions, making it difficult to break free from these entrenched norms.
- **Power dynamics**: Caste-based discrimination is often tied to power dynamics, with dominant castes seeking to maintain their privileged positions. Lower castes face discrimination and exclusion as a means of **preserving existing hierarchies**.
- **Economic Disparities:** Lower-caste individuals often face limited access to education, employment opportunities, and resources, leading to a cycle of poverty and marginalization that reinforces discriminatory practices.
- **Lack of Effective Implementation:** While laws and policies have been enacted to address caste-based discrimination, their effective implementation remains a challenge.
    - Weak enforcement, lack of awareness, and corruption hinder the eradication of discriminatory practices.
- **Political Considerations:** Political parties exploit caste divisions for electoral gains, perpetuating caste-based discrimination for their own interests.

**What is Decasting in India?**

“Decasting” in India refers to the **process of dismantling and eliminating** the entrenched caste-based **discrimination, inequalities, and social hierarchies** present in society. It involves **challenging and overcoming the practices, biases, and prejudices** associated with the caste system.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Steps for Achieving De-casteing in India**|   |
|**Acceptance:**|Acknowledge the presence and impact of casteism in society, instead of denying or overlooking it.|
|**Education:**|Educate younger generations about the importance of seeing beyond caste and the value of inclusivity.|
|**Representation beyond reservations:**|Push for Dalit representation in cultural institutions, intellectual spaces, and media, beyond just reserved seats in politics|
|**Celebrate Dalit History:**|Embrace and highlight the contributions of Dalits in the Indian independence movement and other spheres.|
|**Promote Allies:**|Encourage individuals from privileged castes to become allies, supporting marginalized communities in various spaces.|
|**Build Trust:**|Address and work on the distrust Dalits might feel towards the upper segments of society, fostering unity.|
|**Policies Emphasizing Inclusion:**|Formulate policies that emphasize diversity, inclusion, and equity, ensuring nobody is left behind.|

**Conclusion**

Addressing caste-based discrimination requires a multi-faceted approach that tackles both structural and attitudinal issues. It involves raising awareness, promoting education and economic opportunities, enforcing anti-discrimination laws, and fostering social and cultural change.

### [The key to India’s hunger challenge](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/22/the-key-to-indias-hunger-challenge/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: Social Justice**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-marital-rape-exception-in-the-law-must-be-challenged-7928411/)

 **Context:** The author Ashok Gulati discusses that the key to addressing India’s hunger challenge lies in focusing on [**gender-sensitive growth**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/22/by-prioritizing-gender-sensitive-policies-and-initiatives-india-can-enhance-its-efforts-to-combat-hunger-and-malnutrition-more-effectively-discuss/).

**Status of India on Hunger:**

- The [Global Hunger Index 2022](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/10/17/understanding-the-global-hunger-index/) ranks **India 107 (out of 121 countries),** and the level of hunger and undernutrition in the country is now at “**serious”**
    - India’s rank on this index has been worsening **since 2020 – 94 in 2020** and 101 in 2021.
- With over 19%, India has the **highest rate of** [**child wasting**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/26/indias-child-wasting/#:~:text=India%20had%20an%20overweight%20percentage,severe%20wasting%20live%20in%20Asia) (among under 5 children) in the world.
- Over **16% of Indians are undernourished**, and about one in every three children is stunted.
- **According to the NFHS-5**, **18% of mothers reported** that their child (between ages 6-23 months) did not eat any **food/“zero-food”** in the 24 hours preceding the survey.
- **Close to 40% did not eat any grains** (roti, rice, etc) for an entire day, and six out of 10 children do not consume milk **(“zero-milk”).**

**What is gender-sensitive growth?** 

**Gender-sensitive growth** refers to **economic development and policies** that take into account the specific needs, roles, and contributions of both men and women. This approach acknowledges and addresses gender-based discrimination and seeks to empower women while promoting overall economic progress and social well-being.

**How gender-sensitive growth is key to India’s hunger challenges?**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Aspects**|**Role in India’s Hunger Challenges**|
|**Inclusive Economic Growth**|Gender-sensitive growth promotes **inclusive economic development**, ensuring that both men and women have access to **income-generating opportunities**. This can reduce poverty and increase household resources for better nutrition.|
|[**Women’s Participation in Labor Force**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/issues-related-to-women/women-in-workforce/#:~:text=Women's%20Labor%20force%20participation%20globally,overrepresented%20in%20low%20paying%20jobs.)|By improving women’s participation in the labour force, gender-sensitive growth can **enhance household income**, leading to better affordability of food and improved nutrition.|
|**Education and Skill Development**|Investing in **women’s education and skill development** increases their ability to earn and contribute to family income, reducing vulnerability to hunger and malnutrition.|
|**Women’s Empowerment**|Empowered women have **more decision-making power** within households, including **control over food choices and resources**. This can lead to improved nutritional outcomes for children and families.|
|**Agriculture and Food Systems**|Gender-sensitive growth recognizes **the significant role of women in agriculture and food production**. Providing women with access to resources, technology, and training can enhance **agricultural productivity** and food security.|
|**Nutritional Awareness and Healthcare**|Gender-sensitive approaches can ensure that women and children receive adequate care and nutrition.|
|**Climate Resilience**|Empowering women in **climate-resilient practices and sustainable agriculture** can help mitigate the impact of climate change on food production and availability.|

### [Pros and Cons of Mediation Bill 2021](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/22/pros-and-cons-of-mediation-bill-2021/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: Alternative Dispute Resolution system**

**Source: IE**

 **Context:** The recently passed **Mediation Bill, 2021** in India aims to **govern mediation processes**. We had already discussed [this bill before](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/03/mediation-bill-2021/). Here we will analyse the positive and negative features of the bill.

**What is Mediation?**

**Mediation is an** [**alternative dispute resolution (ADR) method**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/01/13/insights-into-editorial-a-bill-that-could-alter-the-mediation-landscape/) in which a neutral third party, known as a **mediator**, helps parties in a dispute reach a mutually agreeable resolution.

Mediation is considered a **more cost-effective**, **efficient, and less adversarial** method compared to traditional court litigation.

[![Current Affairs](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/ADR.jpg)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/ADR.jpg)

**The Mediation Bill, 2021 brings several positive aspects to India’s legal landscape:**

- **Voluntary Pre-Litigation Mediation**: The Bill recommends making pre-litigation mediation voluntary instead of mandatory, aligning with the core principle of **voluntariness in mediation**.
- **Recognition of Settlement Agreements**: The Bill includes provisions for the recognition and enforcement of settlement agreements arising from mediation.
    - This aligns with international norms, as **India is a signatory to the United Nations Convention on International Settlement Agreements Resulting from Mediation (**[**Singapore Convention**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/09/15/united-nations-convention-on-international-settlement-agreements-resulting-from-mediation/)**).**
- **Efficient Timeframes**: On the recommendation of the parliamentary panel, the bill reduces the time for concluding a mediation process from 180 to 90 days.
    - This streamlined approach **enhances the efficiency of the mediation process**, allowing parties to reach resolutions more promptly.
- **Online and Community Mediation**: The introduction of concepts like “online” and “community” mediation reflects modern approaches to dispute resolution.
- **Flexibility in Interim Relief**: The Bill provides for interim relief in exceptional circumstances during mediation.
- **Inclusion of Mediation Culture**: By providing a legal framework for mediation, the Bill promotes a culture of mediation in India.
- **Global Recognition**: The adoption of dedicated mediation legislation puts India on par with global practices in alternative dispute resolution.
    - This enhances India’s reputation as a **destination for business and investment**.

**Issues with the Mediation Bill, 2021:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Issues**|**Description**|
|**Limited Grounds for Challenge**|This could **hinder parties’ recourse** in case of new evidence or unforeseen circumstances.|
|**Challenge Period Inadequate**|The **90-day period provided to raise challenges** against settlement agreements might not be sufficient for parties to discover certain defects or fraud at a later stage.|
|**Undefined Term “Exceptional Circumstances”**|The term “exceptional circumstances” in Clause 8 under which party can move court (before or during the mediation process)  is undefined in the Bill.|
|**Access to Online Mediation**|Online mediation requires **widespread internet access**, which is not uniformly available across India.|
|**Mandatory Panel of Three Mediators for Community**|Requiring a panel of **three mediators for community mediation** limits the flexibility that mediation usually offers.|
|**Restrictions on Government Participation**|The Bill restricts the government’s participation in mediation proceedings only **to “commercial disputes,”** limiting its potential impact on resolving broader public issues, as the government is the biggest litigant in India.|

**Conclusion:**

The bill provides a legal framework for mediation and reflects the **government’s whole-of-government approach** to promoting alternative dispute resolution. However, the Bill’s impact on **promoting mediation as a preferred mode of justice remains debated**.

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/developers-financiers-will-have-to-take-haircuts-committee-on-stalled-housing-projects-suggests-8903035/)

 **Context**: A committee (chaired by former [**NITI Aayog**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/functions-and-responsibilities-of-the-union-and-the-states-issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure-devolution-of-powers-and-finances-up-to-local-levels-and-challenges-therein/issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure/niti-aayog/) **CEO Amitabh Kant**) formed by the Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry has suggested reviving stalled real estate projects by requiring all stakeholders, including developers, financiers, and land authorities, to accept “**haircuts**” (reduced amounts) to make the projects financially viable.

**Status of Housing projects:**

- The Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) has estimated that over **4 lakh stressed** dwelling units involving over Rs 4 lakh crore are impacted in these stalled real estate projects
- The committee reported that **44% of stalled projects** are in the National Capital Region and **21% in the Mumbai Metropolitan**

**What are Haircuts?**

A haircut refers to the **lower-than-market value** placed on an asset being used as collateral for a loan. In the context of the article, it refers to the **acceptance of reduced amounts or losses by stakeholders,** such as developers and financiers, to make financially troubled projects viable.

**Other Recommendations of the Committee:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Recommendation**|**Description**|
|**Rehabilitation Package**|State governments should **create rehabilitation packages, and** developers should commit to a **three-year completion timeline**.|
|**“Zero Period”**|A “Zero Period” from April 1, 2020, to March 31, 2022, should be established where **interest and penalties** would be suspended due to Covid-19 and court orders.|
|**Co-Developers**|“**Co-developers**” should be allowed to assist developers in completing projects.|
|**Partial Surrender Policy**|Developers should be allowed to **surrender unused land** against their outstanding dues.|
|**Extension of Plan Approvals**|Plan approvals should be **extended by three years without payment** to the Authority.|
|**No Penalty or Extra Interest**|Homebuyers of projects under the state government’s package should **not be charged penalties** or extra interest.|
|**Use of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code**|The use of the [**Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/09/14/insolvency-and-bankruptcy-code-ibc/) should be a last resort.|
|**Enforcement of RERA**|The [Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/10/05/real-estate-regulatory-authority-rera-act-of-2016/), provisions for registering projects with RERA **must be enforced.**|
|**Resolution for Incomplete Projects**|RERAs should identify mostly complete projects facing administrative hurdles and provide a resolution within 30 days.|

**Context:** A **recent archaeological excavation conducted by the State Archaeology Department** in Kerala, uncovered a significant number of [**megalithic**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/12/menhir-and-megalithic-burial-sites/) **“hat stones,” also known as Thoppikkallu in Malayalam**.

- Hat stones are **hemispherical laterite stones that were used as lids on burial urns** during the **megalithic period.**
- This discovery is notable as **it could potentially be the largest collection of hat stones found at an unprotected site in the state.**

**Key Findings:**

- The team found **numerous** [**megalithic burial sites**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/12/menhir-and-megalithic-burial-sites/) **and relics**, including a **unique rock-cut laterite burial chamber**, during the pipeline work that prompted the excavation.
- This site yielded **a large number of earthen urns and distinctive iron implements**, shedding light on **the culture and life of people who inhabited the area over 2,000 years ago**.
- Ashes were discovered within the urns and beneath the hat stones, which is different from the more common occurrence of cremated bones. **This suggests unique mortuary practices at this site**.

 **Context:** Recent discoveries of **two sculptures near Kundapura, Udupi district**, have confirmed the presence of the **ancient Mailara cult in the coastal region.**

- One sculpture was found in a well at Basrur and **depicts a royal hero on a horse holding a sword and a bowl in his hands**. This unique piece lacks the usual Mylaladevi figure on the horse’s back. **The sitting posture of the horse is unusual and dates it to the 15th century A.D.**
- The second discovery is a **small stone tablet depicting Mailara and Mylaladevi both mounted on an ornate horse while holding swords in their right hands**. This relief, found in a tank during dredging, **is in side profile and appears to be from the 17th century.**

Basrur was a **significant trading city during the Medieval period**, with trading **guilds like Uhayadesi and Nanadesi playing active roles**. This environment fostered various cults, including the popular **Mylara cult that was widespread in the Deccan region.**

**About Mailara Cult:** 

The Mailara cult is a religious tradition centred around the **worship of a folk deity named Mailara**, **who is believed to be a manifestation of Lord Shiva**.

This cult is prevalent in parts of southern India, **particularly in the Deccan region**, including Karnataka, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu. The cult has its own **unique rituals, practices, and beliefs that have developed over time.**

 Mailara is often associated with other regional deities like **Mallanna in Andhra Pradesh and Khandoba in Maharashtra.** The cult has a diverse following that **includes people from various castes and occupations, ranging from agricultural and pastoral communities to martial groups.**

### [Demon particle](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/22/demon-particle/)

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**Business Standard**](https://www.business-standard.com/world-news/researchers-unveil-demon-particle-that-can-lead-to-making-superconductors-123081600853_1.html)

 **Context:** Researchers at the University of Illinois have discovered **a massless particle**, often referred **to as a “demon particle**,” which could pave the way for the **development of superconductors capable of functioning at room temperature.**

- [Superconductors](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/01/room-temperature-superconductor/#:~:text=Superconductors%20are%20materials%20that%20transmit,machines%20and%20magnetic%20levitation%20trains.), which can **conduct electricity without resistance**, currently require extremely low temperatures, **often below 100 degrees Fahrenheit**.
- This new discovery could **potentially lead to the creation of superconductors that work at room temperature,** revolutionizing various **fields, including computing and medical imaging**.

The team identified the potential existence of the demon particle while **investigating the properties of the metal strontium ruthenate**, which is similar to high-temperature superconductors.

**About Demon Particle:** 

The prediction of the demon particle was first made by **theoretical physicist David Pines in 1956**. Pines theorized that electrons passing through a solid would exhibit unique behaviours. **This particular particle is intriguing because it lacks mass, making it possible for it to exist and form plasmons (collective units of electrons) at room temperature**, where larger particles wouldn’t typically form plasmons.

**Why it is named a ‘Demon’ particle?**

This name was chosen because the particle’s properties, including being massless, chargeless, and not interacting with light, seemed to **defy conventional understanding**, much like a mythical or supernatural entity. The term “demon” was used metaphorically to convey the **unusual and counterintuitive nature of this theoretical particle.**
