### [Increased rain and reduced snowfall in the Himalayan region](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/18/increased-rain-and-reduced-snowfall-in-the-himalayan-region/)

#### **GS Paper 1**

 **Syllabus: Indian Geography**

**Source:** [**BBC**](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-66519698)

**Context:** A new study has found that mountains across the globe**, including the** [**Himalayas**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-geography-2/physical-geography-of-india/physiographic-division-of-india/northern-mountains/), are now seeing more rainfall at elevations where it has mostly snowed in the past.

**Status of Rainfall and Snowfall in the Himalayan Region:**

- [**IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/09/27/new-ipcc-report-warns-of-dire-threat-to-oceans/) **(2019):** The IPCC reported that **snowfall had decreased in mountain regions**, including the Himalayas, due to higher temperatures, particularly **at lower elevations**.
- **Changing Precipitation Patterns**: Scientific studies have indicated shifts in precipitation patterns in the Himalayan region, with **more instances of extreme precipitation** occurring as rainfall rather than snowfall, even at higher altitudes.

**Why Himalayan region is having Increased rain and reduced snowfall?**

- [**Changing Weather Patterns**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/12/india-is-heating-up-slower-than-the-world-average/#:~:text=Overland%2C%20the%20annual%20mean%20temperatures,degrees%20Celsius%20since%20preindustrial%20times.&text=Oceans%2C%20in%20contrast%2C%20have%20warmed%20by%20about%200.88%20degree%20Celsius.&text=Annual%20mean%20temperatures%20over%20India,has%20been%201.1%20degrees%20C.)**:** Alterations in atmospheric circulation, jet streams, and other weather systems can result in shifts in precipitation patterns.
- [**Global Warming and Temperature Rise**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Global-Warming-and-its-Effect-on-India.pdf): As global temperatures increase, the atmosphere can hold more moisture, leading to increased evaporation and subsequent precipitation.
- **Elevated Freezing Levels**: The freezing level, also known as the **zero-degree isotherm**, is the altitude at which falling precipitation transitions from snow to rain.
    - Rising temperatures **associated with global warming have caused the freezing level to rise**, leading to more rain at higher altitudes that used to receive snowfall.
- **Snowfall Reduction**: Warmer temperatures cause more precipitation to fall as rain rather than snow
- **Feedback Loops:** Less snow cover means there is less reflective surface to bounce sunlight back into space (albedo effect), causing further warming and contributing to the shift from snow to rain.
- **Warming-Induced Atmospheric Changes**: This can lead to a greater intensity of storms, causing heavy rainfall events in areas where snowfall was historically dominant.

**Impact of increased rain and reduced snowfall in the Himalayan region:**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Impact**|**Description**|**Examples**|
|**Increasing disasters**|Shifts from snowfall to rainfall at higher elevations, affect **water availability and hazards.**|More instances of heavy rainfall cause flash floods.|
|**Water Resource Changes**|Altered snowmelt and rain patterns affect river flow, water availability, and ecosystem dynamics.|Changes in river flow and hydrological patterns.|
|**Increased Flood and Landslide Risk**|Rainwater saturates the soil, leading to landslides, debris flows, and flash floods.|[**Uttarakhand’s 2013 flash floods**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/02/10/insights-into-editorial-troubled-mountains-on-uttarakhand-glacier-disaster/) due to excessive rainfall.|
|**Impact on Ecosystems and Biodiversity**|Altered precipitation affects vegetation, wildlife, and fragile mountain ecosystems.|Changes in alpine flora and fauna due to shifting climate.|
|**Socioeconomic Consequences**|Reduced snowfall impacts **winter tourism, agriculture, and water-dependent livelihoods.**|Ski resorts face challenges due to shorter snow seasons.|
|**Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs)**|Faster glacial melt leads to unstable glacial lakes and potential GLOFs, posing flood risks downstream.|**Imja Lake in Nepal** is at risk of GLOF due to glacial melt.|
|**Infrastructure Vulnerability**|Changes in rainfall patterns challenge infrastructure resilience and lead to increased disaster risks.|Damage to roads, bridges, and hydropower plants.|

### [Analysis of Recent Reforms in Indian Criminal Law](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/18/analysis-of-recent-reforms-in-indian-criminal-law/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: Governance: Indian Criminal Justice System**

**Source:** [**LM**](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/our-criminal-laws-must-uphold-gender-justice-11692196956479.html#:~:text=What%20we%20need%20is%20to,enact%20must%20assure%20everyone%20equality.)

 **Context:** We have already discussed the [need and provisions of the bill](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/14/bill-introduced-reforms-in-indian-criminal-law/). Here in this article, we will discuss the pros and cons of the proposed bill.

**Major Provisions of the Bills:**

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/reforms.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/reforms.png)**

**Objective of the Bills:**  These bills aim to **modernize the criminal justice system** by updating laws, incorporating digital interfaces, expediting legal processes, and **introducing community service as a form of punishment for minor offences**.

**The positive aspects of the proposed criminal law reforms:**

- **Modernization of** [**Criminal Justice System**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/03/24/criminal-justice-reforms-3/): E.g., using e-FIR, Zero FIR, new cyber offences, and modernize evidence collection.
- **Update of Outdated Laws**
- **Stringent Provisions for Women and Children**: The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) has dedicated a separate chapter to these matters and introduced new forms of offence.
- **Innovations:** Innovations such **as trial in absentia** and the introduction of **community service** as a penalty for minor offences are noteworthy.
- **Gender Inclusivity**: The proposed reforms have reviewed language for gender neutrality and replaced outdated terms such as **‘insanity’ with ‘mental illness**.’
- **Specific Definitions and Offenses**: The bills define and address offences like terrorism, organized crime, mob lynching, and negligent acts, adding new dimensions to criminal law.
- **Protection for Victims:**g., protection and rights of victims, including provisions related to victims’ participation, and rights.
- **Expedited Justice**: E.g., Requirement for judgments to be given within 30 days after the trial concludes and **limitations on adjournments.**

**Issues with the Proposed Bills:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Issues**|**Explanation and Concerns**|
|**Gender-Biased Language and Assumptions**|The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) bill reflects gender bias by **treating women as needing protection rather than equals**. **Marital rape** is criminalized only if the wife is under 18, perpetuating the idea of spousal ownership and control.|
|**Regressive Terminology and Assumptions**|Sections like “**outraging modesty” (BNS Section 73)** employ regressive terminology, reflecting outdated ideas about women’s behaviour and morality.|
|**Incomplete Protections for Men and Non-Binary Individuals**|The bills **do not provide sufficient remedies for men or non-binary individuals** who face similar violations.<br><br>The bills focus on sexual offences against women and **do not adequately address sexual offences perpetrated by men against other men** or women against other women|
|**Ambiguities in Certain Clauses**|The inclusion of **“deceitful means” for marriage (exact provisions not specified)** creates ambiguity in judging guilt and determining.|
|**Discretionary Powers and Potential for Misuse**|The bills grant discretionary powers to law enforcement agencies, such as the **“right to handcuff**,”.|
|**Weakened Protections Against State Abuse and Violence**|The new bills seemingly endorse practices like **detention without charges for extended periods (90 days in certain cases),** raising concerns about the potential erosion of individual liberties and rights.|
|**Ambiguity in the Definition of Offenses**|The definition of offences like **“subversive activities” and “provocation and intimidation of the government**” (exact provisions not specified) is vague and broad, potentially leading to overreach and misuse.|

### [SHGs: ‘Lakhpati Didi’ scheme](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/18/shgs-lakhpati-didi-scheme/)

#### **GS Paper  2**

 **Syllabus: Social Justice/ Governance: SHG**

**Source:** [**ET**](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/govt-planning-skill-training-for-2-crore-women-under-lakhpati-didi-scheme-says-official/articleshow/102743750.cms?from=mdr)

**Context:** The Indian government is initiating the **‘Lakhpati Didi’ scheme**, aiming to provide skill development training to **two crore women** to encourage them to establish micro-enterprises through [**Self-Help Groups**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Self-Help-Groups-SHGs.pdf) **(SHGs)**

**About the Scheme:** 

The ‘Lakhpati Didi’ scheme is an initiative to **empower women in rural areas** by encouraging them to **start micro-enterprises** and become economically self-sufficient.

**Features:**

- **Aim**: The goal of the scheme is to create **two crore women millionaires (“[lakhpati didis](https://www.insightsonindia.com/tag/lakhpati-didis/)“)** in villages using SHGs
    - **Fostering women-led development** and promoting their active participation in the workforce and economic growth.
- **Providing skill development** training to women through Self Help Groups (SHGs)
- Enabling them to **earn at least Rs 1 lakh annually**
- **Skills covered:** plumbing, LED bulb making, and operating and repairing drones, among others.

**What are SHGs?** 

**SHGs, or self-help groups, are community-based organizations** formed by a group of individuals, primarily women, who come together to address their common economic, social, or developmental needs. Women SHGs play a significant role in the Indian administrative ecosystem by **empowering women, promoting socio-economic development**, and contributing to grassroots governance.

**How do Women’s self-help groups (SHG) complement government welfare schemes?**

- **Partnership with Government Agencies**: SHGs collaborate with government agencies at different levels, including the local, district, and state administrations.
- **Execution of Government Programs**: SHGs serve as implementing units for various government programs, such as the National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM), National Urban Livelihoods Mission (NULM), and Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA).
- **Financial Inclusion and Microfinance**: SHGs are linked to formal banking institutions via NABARD’s SHG-Bank Linking Program, and they play a crucial role in promoting financial inclusion by accessing credit, savings, and insurance services.
    - According to the NABARD, SHGs have saved over Rs. 30,000 crores collectively.
- **Last Mile Delivery**: SHGs act as intermediaries between government agencies and the community, ensuring the last-mile delivery of services and programs.
    - According to a study by the NABARD, SHGs have played a significant role in poverty reduction in India, lifting millions of women out of poverty.
- **Grassroots Participation**: SHGs provide a platform for women to actively participate in decision-making processes and contribute to local governance.
    - An example is the **success of the Mission Shakti program in Odisha**, where over 7 lakh women have been organized into SHGs, leading to their empowerment and active participation.
- **Capacity Building**: They provide training, knowledge sharing, and awareness programs on various subjects such as financial management, entrepreneurship, health, and hygiene.

**Case Study**[**: Kudumbashree in Kerala**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/19/25-years-of-kudumbashree/#:~:text=Kudumbashree%20has%20helped%20marginalized%20women%20become%20successful%20entrepreneurs%20and%20income%20generators.&text=E.g.%2C%20It%20has%20established%20%E2%80%9CJanakeeya,meals%20for%20just%20Rs%2020.) **(completed 25 years this year (2023))**

- **Partnership with Government**: Kudumbashree operates under the guidance and support of the State Poverty Eradication Mission, which works closely with various government departments, including the local self-government institutions.
- **Execution of Programs**: Kudumbashree operates through **neighbourhood groups (NHGs),** which are small SHGs at the grassroots level. For example, Kudumbashree NHGs play a significant role in the implementation of the NRLM in Kerala
- **Financial Inclusion and Microfinance**: Kudumbashree NHGs are linked to the banking sector through the formation of Community Development Societies (CDS).
- **Social Welfare and Development Initiatives**: They are involved in activities like healthcare awareness campaigns, sanitation drives, educational programs, and skill training for women.
- **Grassroots Participation**: Kudumbashree NHGs also collaborate with local self-government institutions to implement various development projects in their respective areas.

 **Other notable case studies**: Mission Shakti in Odisha, Swa-Shakti Project in Rajasthan, and Baba Jaleswar SHG.

**Conclusion**:

As per [Economic Survey 2022-23](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/01/economic-survey-2023-here-are-the-key-takeaways/), **India boasts of some 12 million SHGs**, of which 88 per cent are all-women-member ones. They are an integral part of the government’s efforts and its lower-tier governance set up to promote women’s empowerment, poverty reduction, and inclusive development.

**Source:** [**ET**](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/scheme-for-formal-employment-generation-falls-short-of-target/articleshow/102781224.cms?from=mdr)

**Context**: According to the latest government data, the [**Aatmanirbhar Bharat Rojgar Yojana (ABRY)** scheme](https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/welfare-schemes/schemes-under-atmanirbhar-bharat-rojgar-yojana-abry/atmanirbhar-bharat-rojgar-yojana-abry/#:~:text=Government%20will%20pay%20both%2012,1000%20employees%20for%20two%20years.) has fallen short of its employment generation targets.

**About ABRY:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Aspect**|**Aatmanirbhar Bharat Rojgar Yojana (ABRY)**|
|**Launch Date**|December 2020 (under the Ministry of Labour & Employment)|
|**Objective**|Boost formal employment generation post-COVID-19 disruptions|
|**Target Audience**|New **employees earning less than ₹15,000 per month** in EPFO-registered companies|
|**Implementation Agency**|[Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation](https://www.insightsonindia.com/tag/epfo/) (EPFO)|
|**Contribution Exemption**|Eligible employees do not need to contribute to PF and pension **for 2 years**|
|**Reimbursement**|The government reimburses **either both employee and employer contributions (24% of wages)** or only employee contributions (12% of wages)|
|**Eligibility Criteria**|Employees hired **until March 2022**, and those who lost jobs between March 1, 2020, and September 30, 2020, earning less than ₹15,000 per month|

|**Top 10 States in Employment Generation**|Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Telangana, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh|

**Issues and challenges associated with the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Rojgar Yojana (ABRY):**

- **Shortfalls in Enrollment and Job Creation**: Enrollment figures indicate that fewer eligible employees have participated in the scheme than anticipated.
- **Disbursement Delays**: The disbursements under the scheme have lagged behind the set targets, with only about **42%** of the initial targeted expenditure utilized so far.
- **Limited Impact on Employment Generation**: The scheme’s outcomes suggest that it has not been as effective in generating employment as envisioned.
- **Complexity and Eligibility Criteria**: The complexity of eligibility criteria is creating confusion among eligible employees, employers, and implementing agencies.
- **Geographical Disparities:** The concentration of beneficiaries in certain states indicates geographical disparities in employment generation.
- **Lack of Adequate Promotion**: The limited awareness and promotion of the scheme might be contributing to the lower enrollment figures.

**Conclusion:**

While the [Aatmanirbhar Bharat Rojgar Yojana](https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/welfare-schemes/schemes-under-atmanirbhar-bharat-rojgar-yojana-abry/atmanirbhar-bharat-rojgar-yojana-abry/#:~:text=Government%20will%20pay%20both%2012,1000%20employees%20for%20two%20years.) (ABRY) has encountered **certain challenges in meeting its initial targets** for job creation and disbursements, it has nonetheless contributed to formal employment generation during a challenging economic period post-COVID-19.

 **Context: Indian and Russian** scientists **have identified a new species of salamander called Tylototriton zaimeng in Manipur’s mountain lakes.**

- Previously mistaken for similar species**, the new discovery was made by merging molecular and morphological evidence.**

This **salamander’s characteristics were revealed to be distinct from its close relatives, featuring a wide head, well-developed sagittal ridge, and unique colouration**.

DNA tests confirmed its uniqueness and revealed its genetic relationship. The species is confined to **Manipur’s Khongtheng mountain range and due to its limited distribution, scientists recommend its inclusion as a vulnerable species on the IUCN Red List**, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.

**What is a salamander?**

 Salamanders are small **amphibians that belong to the order Caudata**. They have long bodies, short legs, and smooth, moist skin. Salamanders are known for their ability to regenerate lost limbs, which is a unique trait among vertebrates.
