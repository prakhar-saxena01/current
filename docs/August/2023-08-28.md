### [Lead poisoning in India](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/28/lead-poisoning-in-india/)

#### **GS2/GS3 Paper** 

 **Syllabus: Social Issues/ Science and Technology**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/a-hidden-adversary-despite-being-a-recognised-global-concern-lead-poisoning-is-unaddressed-8909773/)

**Context**: Lead poisoning poses a **hidden threat in India**, with **over half of children** having blood lead levels above **5 micrograms per deciliter (µg/dL) (**[**WHO**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/international-relations/important-international-institutions-agencies-and-further-structure-mandate-etc/who/) **safe level),** according to studies.

**What is lead?**

Lead is a **heavy metal element that is toxic to humans** and can cause serious health problems when ingested or inhaled, especially in high amounts. Major sources of lead exposure include **lead-based paints, lead batteries, contaminated soil and water**, and occupational exposure in industries such as mining, smelting, and battery recycling.

**What is** [**Lead poisoning**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/03/26/lead-poisoning/)**?**

It is a condition that **occurs when a person’s body accumulates high levels of lead**, a toxic metal. It can lead to various health issues, especially in children, including learning disabilities, neurological problems, stunted growth, and organ damage.

**Concerns of Lead Poisoning in India:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|||
|**High Exposure in Children**|A 2021 study found that about **20 crore children in India** have blood lead levels exceeding the safe limit set by WHO.|
|**Severe Health Impact**|Lead poisoning can lead **to learning disabilities, neurological impairments**, stunted growth, and organ damage. Children are especially vulnerable.|
|**Economic and Social Impact**|The effects of lead poisoning account for a significant learning gap between rich and poor countries. Affected children might achieve less in education and work, impacting the nation’s productivity.|
|**Impacted regions**|Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, and Andhra Pradesh account for 40% of the population with high blood lead levels.|

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/widespred.png)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/widespred.png)

**Factors contributing to lead poisoning:**

- **Informal and substandard recycling** of lead-acid batteries.
- **Increase in vehicle ownership**, combined with the lack of **vehicle battery recycling** regulation and infrastructure.
- **Workers in dangerous and often illegal recycling** operations break open battery cases, and spill acid and lead dust into the soil.

**Government steps to control lead poisoning:**

- [**National Programme for Prevention and Control of Fluorosis**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/08/06/fluorosis/)**,** Endemic Skeletal Fluorosis and Arsenicosis: Launched in 2010 to prevent lead poisoning.
- **Import Ban on Non-Compliant Lead Acid Batteries**: In 2013, the Ministry of Environment and Forests banned non-compliant lead acid battery imports.
- [**National Health Mission**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/tag/national-health-mission/) **(NHM):** Provides healthcare services, including lead poisoning screening and treatment.
- [**Lead Battery Waste Management Rules, 2016**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/environment-pollution-and-control/waste-management/e-waste/): Regulates lead-acid battery disposal and promotes safe recycling.
- **National Programme for the Health Care of the Elderly (NPHCE):** Offers healthcare to the elderly, who are vulnerable to lead poisoning.
- **Center for Advanced Research on Environmental Health (CAREH):** Conducts research on environmental health, including lead poisoning.

**Global efforts to address lead poisoning have taken various approaches:**

- **S. Gasoline Initiative**: The U.S. successfully reduced blood lead concentrations by **more than 90% from 1976 to 1995** by eliminating lead from gasoline.
- **Paint and Water-Pipe Regulations**: Many countries have implemented stringent standards to ensure paints and water pipes are lead-free, minimizing potential sources of lead exposure.
- **Bangladesh’s Turmeric Solution**: In Bangladesh, lead contamination through turmeric adulteration was tackled by enforcing strict regulations and raising consumer awareness between 2017 and 2021, resulting in a decrease of lead-tainted turmeric from **47% in 2019 to 0% in 2021**

**Way forward for India to control lead poisoning:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Approach**|**Description**|
|**Clear Legislation**|A strong legislative framework is needed to establish health and safety standards for lead-containing products.|
|**Enforce Standards**|Strict enforcement of regulations on lead-free paints and water pipes.|
|**Monitoring System**|Establish blood lead level testing, including in household surveys to identify affected populations.|
|**Identify Contaminated Sites**|Nationwide efforts to locate lead-contaminated areas, with priority on clean-ups near schools and residential zones.|
|**Promote Sustainable Practices**|Implement waste management and e-waste recycling programs to reduce lead contamination.|
|**Inter-departmental Coordination**|Enhance collaboration between government agencies, NGOs, and international partners for cohesive action.|
|**Public Awareness**|Raise awareness among parents, workers, schools, and healthcare professionals about lead’s dangers.|

**Insta Facts:**

- **Lead in the body is distributed to the brain, liver, kidney and bones**. It is stored in the teeth and bones, where it accumulates over time.
- **Lead in bone is released into the blood during pregnancy**and becomes a source of exposure to the developing foetus.
- WHO has identified **lead as 1 of 10 chemicals of major public health concern**.
- WHO has joined with the [**United Nations Environment Programme**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/02/05/unep50/#:~:text=UNEP%20was%20conceived%20to%20monitor,Frontiers%2C%20Invest%20into%20Healthy%20Planet.) to form the Global Alliance to Eliminate Lead Paint.

### [Rethink the dynamics of India’s fiscal federalism](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/28/rethink-the-dynamics-of-indias-fiscal-federalism/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus: Government Budgeting**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/rethink-the-emerging-dynamics-of-indias-fiscal-federalism/article67235948.ece#:~:text=The%20paradigm%20shift%20from%20a,the%20passing%20of%20the%20Fiscal)

 **Context:** The evolving dynamics of [India’s fiscal federalism](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/07/29/editorial-analysis-the-poor-state-of-indias-fiscal-federalism/#:~:text=In%20sum%2C%20India's%20fiscal%20federalism,for%20such%20inequities%20in%20planning.) require reconsideration due to various factors, such as the shift to a market-based economy, changes in the fiscal landscape, and amendments to the Constitution.

**What is the meaning of India’s fiscal federalism?**

**India’s fiscal federalism refers to the division of financial powers** and responsibilities between the central government and state governments within the framework of a federal system. It involves **how revenue is generated, shared, and utilized to fund public services** and governance across different levels of government in the country.

**Issues with the India’s fiscal federalism:**

- Replacement of [**Planning Commission**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-economy-3/planning-in-india/genesis-of-planning-commission-and-its-objectives/) **with** [**NITI Aayog**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/functions-and-responsibilities-of-the-union-and-the-states-issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure-devolution-of-powers-and-finances-up-to-local-levels-and-challenges-therein/issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure/niti-aayog/)**.**
- **Authority of** [**GST Council**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/04/6-years-of-gst/) under Goods and Services Act.
- **Impact of widespread cess and surcharges** on divisible pool size.
- Neglect of integrating the **third tier of governance**.
- **Lack of consistent financial reporting** across all government tiers.
- No comprehensive review of [**off-budget borrowing**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/01/27/off-budget-borrowing/#:~:text=Off%2Dbudget%20borrowings%20are%20loans,fulfil%20the%20government's%20expenditure%20needs.) **practices**.
- **States are subject to restraint through Article 293(3)**under the oversight of the Union and the [FRBM Act](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/02/02/govt-hopes-to-cut-fiscal-deficit-to-4-5-by-fy26/#:~:text=What%20are%20the%20objectives%20of,deal%20with%20inflation%20in%20India.), but the Union frequently evades such checks.
- The substantial **use of the National Small Saving Fund (NSSF)**for financing central PSUs through loans is not **included in the Union’s fiscal deficits**.

**Issues of Fiscal Federalism w.r.t GST:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
||Details|
|**1. Financial Autonomy of States**|GST has made the country’s indirect tax regime more unitary, reducing states’ financial autonomy.|
|**2. GST Compensation**|States were promised compensation if revenue growth fell below 14%, but the Centre missed payments, causing friction.|
|**3. GST Council**|The central government’s vote counts for one-third, giving it considerable influence; A Recent Supreme Court ruling grants states flexibility in decision-making.|
|**4. Revenue Shortfall**|States face a significant GST revenue gap, causing financial challenges and impacting fiscal federalism.|

**Why is there a need for re-evaluating** [**Article 246 and the Seventh Schedule**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/functions-and-responsibilities-of-the-union-and-the-states-issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure-devolution-of-powers-and-finances-up-to-local-levels-and-challenges-therein/functions-and-responsibilities-of-the-union-and-the-states/7th-schedule/#:~:text=The%20seventh%20schedule%20under%20Article,State%20List%20and%20Concurrent%20List.)**?**

- **Changing Political Landscape:** India’s shift from a single-party to a multi-party system has led to new dynamics in governance.
- **Altered Dynamics:** Changes in politics, society, technology, demographics, and development approaches have significantly transformed the landscape.
- **Additional Burden:** Central legislations like MGNREGA, RTE Act, and NFS Act have placed extra responsibilities on states.
- **Constitution-Making Gap:** The original constitution-making process didn’t adequately address the division of responsibilities and taxation authority.
- **Borrowed Framework:** The constitution borrowed heavily from the Government of India Act 1935, lacking the subsidiarity principle.
- **Missed Opportunity:** The [73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/functions-and-responsibilities-of-the-union-and-the-states-issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure-devolution-of-powers-and-finances-up-to-local-levels-and-challenges-therein/devolution-of-powers-and-finances-up-to-local-levels-and-challenges-therein/73rd-amendment-act-panchayati-raj/) provided a chance for reconsideration, but no substantial steps were taken.
- **Complexity Introduced:** Introduction of Schedule XI and Schedule XII complicated matters without clear operational significance.
- **Need for Specificity:** These schedules need to be broken down into specific activities and sub-activities, similar to Kerala’s approach, for practical relevance.

**What should be done:**

- **Equity in Intergovernmental Transfers**: India’s transfer system should prioritize equity. The **16th Finance Commission should** focus on equity in tax devolution.
- **Revisiting Article 246 and Seventh Schedule**
- **Subsidiarity Principle for Division of Functions**: The introduction of a new local list detailing the responsibilities of local governments is necessary.
- **Empowering the Third Tier:** Recognizing local governments’ role, the upcoming Union Finance Commission should address this.
- **Reviewing Off-Budget Borrowing**: Off-budget borrowing practices by both the Union and States need review. **Transparency is crucial, and all income** and expenditure transactions should be accounted for within the budget.

### [Solution to minimize heatwaves in Urban India](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/28/solution-to-minimize-heatwaves-in-urban-india/)

#### **Content for Mains Enrichment**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/governance/road-to-cool-cities-codes-based-on-unique-urban-form-can-be-helpful-91367#:~:text=Urban%20form%2Dbased%20codes%20can,regulations%20with%20contextual%20cooling%20solutions.)

The study conducted by the **Centre for Science and Environment (CSE)** explores the impact of different urban forms on heat resilience.

**Key findings and recommendations include:**

- **Morphology Influence:** Areas with **open highrise, open midrise, and compact midrise urban morphologies** show lower land surface temperatures (LST), indicating better heat resilience.
    - **Low-rise areas with sparse** vegetation tend to have higher LST.
- **Blue/Green Infrastructure**: Greenery, like trees, shrubs, and grass, enhances microclimates. Effective vegetation cover (EVC) reduces LST; trees with thick foliage are more effective.
- **Floor Space Index (FSI):** Higher FSI correlates with lower LST. Increased FSI results in decreased temperatures.
- **Street Orientation**: North-south-oriented streets have higher LST due to sun exposure, offering guidelines for **urban planning.**
- **Cooling Solutions**: Different urban forms can have distinct zoning regulations for heat resilience, such as shaded walkways, cool roofs, and high EVC.
- **Adapting Urban Plans**: Cities should amend building by-laws and master plans based on factors influencing heat gain.
- **Impact on Energy Consumption**: A 1°C temperature decrease can lead to a 2% reduction in the city’s power consumption.

**Usage**: The solutions can be used in governance/Disaster Management Questions.

### [Right To Repair](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/28/right-to-repair/)

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/apples-right-to-repair-volte-face-is-a-big-deal/article67238500.ece#:~:text=At%20one%20point%2C%20Apple%20lobbyists,to%20fix%20damaged%20electronic%20products.)

 **Apple’s surprising reversal on the “right to repair”** movement holds immense significance, considering it was previously among the tech giants opposing the concept.

**Apple now supports legislation granting consumers** and **third-party firms the right to fix** damaged electronic products. This shift aligns with a broader trend of tech companies adapting to consumer demands for greater control over their devices.

**What is the Right to Repair?**

The Right to Repair refers to **government legislation that is intended to allow consumers the ability to repair** and modify their own consumer electronic devices, where otherwise the manufacturer of such devices **requires the consumer to use only their offered services**.

**The logic behind ‘Right to Repair’?**

**When customers buy a product,** it is inherent that they must own it completely, for which the consumers should be able to repair and modify the product with ease and at a reasonable cost, without being captive to the whims of manufacturers for repairs.

**Origin of the Idea:** The idea originally originated from the **USA where the Motor Vehicle Owners’ Right to Repair Act 2012**, required the manufacturers to provide the necessary documents and information to allow anyone to repair their vehicles.

**Previously,** MeitY launched a pilot project on [**Electronics Repair Services Outsourcing**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/02/electronics-repair-services-outsourcing-erso/) **(ERSO) to make India a Global Repair Capital.**

Through the ERSO scheme, India hopes to **capture 20% of the global repair service market** – currently valued at $100 billion – in five years. At present, India’s revenue from repair services is about $350 million.

- These errors, often arising from the repeated copying of the genome, **increase with age and tissue turnover**. Some of these mutations can **confer advantages to cells, leading to the development of tumours known as driver mutations.**

**About Somatic Genetic Variants:** 

- Somatic genetic variants, also known as **somatic mutations or somatic changes**, refer to **alterations in the DNA sequence that occur in the cells of an individual’s body after conception**.
- Somatic mutations can occur for various reasons, **such as errors during DNA replication, exposure to environmental factors (like radiation or chemicals), or simply as a natural consequence of cellular**
- Somatic mutations can have **different effects depending on where they occur in the genome and which genes are affected**.
- Some somatic **mutations are harmless and have no discernible impact** on the cell or individual. However, **others can lead to the development of diseases, including cancer.**

 **Context:** The **“**[**State of India’s Birds**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/02/18/state-of-indias-birds-2020/)**, 2023″ report** reveals a **widespread decline in most bird species** across the country, **with some currently declining and others projected to decline in the future.**

**Key Findings:**

- **Raptors, migratory shorebirds, and ducks** have experienced the most significant declines.
- However, several species like the **Indian Peafowl, Rock Pigeon, Asian Koel, and House Crow are thriving and increasing in both abundance and distribution**.
- The assessments, based on **data from around 30,000 birdwatchers**, indicate that **60% of the 338 species with identifiable long-term trends have declined**, while 36 species have increased.
- **Specialist bird species, which inhabit specific habitats like wetlands and rainforests, are facing rapid declines, while generalist species capable of adapting to various habitats are faring better**.
- Long-distance migratory birds, such as those from Eurasia and the Arctic, have suffered significant declines, while resident species remain more stable.
- Birds with **diets focused on vertebrates and carrion have seen notable declines**, potentially due to **harmful pollutants present in these food resources**.
- The report emphasizes the decline of species endemic to the **Western Ghats and Sri Lanka** [**biodiversity hotspot**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/biodiversity/biodiversity-hotspot-in-india/)**s****.**

The main **threats to birdlife in India highlighted in the report include:**

- **Climate Change**
- **Urbanization**
- **Monocultures**
- **Energy Infrastructure**
