### [Expansion of BRICS](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/25/expansion-of-brics/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: Multilateral Organizations**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/brics-expansion-significance-for-india-8907925/)

**Context:** The alliance of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa invited **six more countries (Iran, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Argentina, Egypt, and Ethiopia) to join**, starting in January 2024.

- This article is in continuation of the article [“Admitting new members to BRICS”](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/21/admitting-new-members-to-brics/) posted four days ago in Daily CA.

**India’s stance on expansion:**

- India welcomed the **consensus-based expansion** of the BRICS grouping during the **15th** [**BRICS**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/01/india-and-brics/) **summit** in Johannesburg.
- The move strengthens [**BRICS**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/01/india-and-brics/) **as a representative of developing countries**
- India has proposed creating a **BRICS space consortium**, investing in skill mapping, technology, and education, and emphasising cooperation for conservation efforts.
- The expansion is aimed at making **BRICS future-ready** by enhancing cooperation, digital solutions, and development initiatives.

**Significance for India:**

The addition of new members to BRICS holds significance for India in terms of **expanding partnerships and geopolitical influence, while also raising concerns about potential pro-China dominance** within the alliance.

**Concerns**: Concerns exist that the expansion could lead to increased pro-China influence within BRICS, possibly side-lining other member voices.

**Conclusion:** 

While it strengthens BRICS’ position as a platform for developing countries, there’s a need for India to ensure its voice and interests aren’t overshadowed by the growing influence of China and other new members.

### [Pakistan Army Act](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/25/pakistan-army-act/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: International Relations**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/explained-what-are-the-amendments-to-the-pakistan-army-act/article67228529.ece#:~:text=The%20Bill%20has%20expanded%20the,Urea%2C%20Fauji%20Cement%2C%20etc.)

**Context**: The Pakistan Senate passed a Bill on July 27, 2023, to amend the **Pakistan Army Act, 1952.**

**What is the ongoing issue with** [**Pakistan**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/international-relations/india-and-its-neighborhood/indo-pakistan-relations/)**?**

The ongoing political crisis in Pakistan has **escalated with the arrest of former Prime Minister Imran Khan.** The conflict centres around **Khan’s confrontation with the military establishment,** marking a power struggle between the **popular politician and the powerful institution**. Khan’s arrest led to **widespread protests and violence**, causing damage to military installations. The military responded **forcefully, indicating a strong stance against dissent.** The arrest was deemed **unlawful by Pakistan’s Supreme Court**, further highlighting the power struggle.

**Khan’s popularity** had previously acted as a **buffer against the military’s assertiveness**, but the recent events have **intensified the conflict.** The Present coalition government has also **confronted the judiciary**, adding to the chaos. Meanwhile, **Pakistan’s economy is in dire straits,** with looming **default and high inflation**. General elections are due, but the Military appears to **want Khan sidelined**.

**Against this backdrop, Pakisatan’s army has endorsed the amendment to The Army Act.**

**Key Features of Amendments:**

|   |
|---|
|**Controversies and Concerns**|
|Expands Act to **include civilians in army-affiliated entities.**|
|It criminalizes **unauthorized disclosure, raising concerns** about freedom of information. It bars **political activity for two years after retirement**.|
|It restricts **engagement with conflicting entities**, raising concerns about post-retirement opportunities. It outlines **punishments for undermining the Armed Forces,** which could curb freedom of expression.|
|**Rushed Passage of the Bill**: Passed quickly without proper notice, raising questions about transparency and the legislative process.|
|**Intimidation of Veterans**: Seen as targeting retired personnel supporting Imran Khan, which could stifle dissent.|

**Concerns**: The amendments to the **Pakistan Army Act signal a power struggle** between Imran Khan and the military establishment, impacting **Pakistan’s domestic stability**. This situation has implications for **India’s neighbour,** with potential repercussions on regional dynamics and security.

### [India’s protectionist Industrial Policy](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/25/indias-protectionist-industrial-policy/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus: Industrial Policies Since Independence**

**Source:** [**BS**](https://www.business-standard.com/opinion/columns/perspectives-on-industrial-policy-123082301031_1.html)

 **Context:** The author discusses India’s protectionist policies in manufacturing and electronics, contrasting them with targeted approaches in the US and EU.

**What meaning of** [**Protectionist measures**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/07/15/editorial-analysis-is-protectionism-compatible-with-liberalization/)**?**

It refers to **economic policies and actions** taken by a country to **protect its domestic industries, businesses, and workers** from foreign competition.

- These measures can include **tariffs, quotas, subsidies, and other barriers** that make imported goods more expensive or difficult to access, thereby promoting domestic production and consumption.
- The goal is to **shield domestic industries** from foreign competition and support local economic growth.

**Issues** [**with India’s Protectionist Measures**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/07/15/editorial-analysis-is-protectionism-compatible-with-liberalization/)**:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Issues**|**Description**|
|**High Tariffs**|Import restrictions and high tariffs on electronic goods like laptops and tablets, make tariffs the highest among competing economies.|
|**Broad Protectionism**|Protective measures spanning **14 sectors**, some lacking a clear strategic basis (e.g., textiles, food processing).|
|**Challenges in the Electronics Sector**|Rapid technological changes in the electronics sector make domestic manufacturing keeping pace with global advancements a challenge.|
|**Lack of Targeted Strategies**|India’s industrial policy lacks targeted sector-specific strategies, unlike the US and EU’s approaches.|
|**Missed Opportunity**|Failure to fully integrate with global value chains can hinder competitiveness and growth in certain sectors.|
|**Trade Barriers for Innovation**|**Excessive protectionism** can hinder exposure to global competition and restrict innovation and efficiency.|
|**Limited Focus on Technological Advancement**|India’s policy may not prioritize technological advancement, putting it at a disadvantage in rapidly evolving industries.|

**How other countries are applying protectionist measures?**

- **US**: The US has introduced the [**CHIPS and Science Act**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/02/semiconductor-manufacturing-in-india/) to boost domestic research and manufacturing in semiconductors and electric vehicles. This initiative aims to **reduce reliance on countries like China and Russia** and enhance “**strategic autonomy.**” The **US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)** also promotes regional economic integration.
- **EU**: The EU’s [**Green Deal Industrial Plan**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/tag/green-deal-industrial-plan/) aims for **carbon neutrality by 2050**. The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) taxes imports from **high carbon-output sectors,** affecting major exporters like China and Russia. The EU’s approach focuses on **environmental sustainability**.

Both the US and EU use selective protectionist measures. The US emphasizes **technological advancement** and reducing **geopolitical risks**, while the EU targets **environmental sustainability**. Their strategies have specific goals, unlike **India’s broader approach.**

**What should India do?** 

- **Embrace Open Trade in Electronics**: Rapid technological changes in the electronics sector make **import substitution difficult**. Given global value chains and the success of top exporters as importers, **India should adopt open trade policies for smoother cross-border transactions.**
- **Learn from Asian Economies:** China and Vietnam’s success in the electronics sector stems from **open trade policies**. China’s dual trade regime, allowing **duty-free entry for components,** boosted exports. India could **benefit by adopting similar strategies**.
- **Combine Incentives with Trade Liberalization**: Following countries like South Korea, India should **merge financial incentives with trade liberalization**. Shifting from **import substitution to export expansion** can enhance competition, efficiency, and innovation.

**The** [**Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT),** Ministry of Commerce & Industry](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/06/the-new-industrial-policy-aims-to-focus-on-one-nation-one-standard/), is working on a new industrial policy. This will be the **third industrial policy (after 1956 and 1991),** which is likely to replace the 1991 policy, which was prepared against the backdrop of the balance of payment crisis.

### [Why rural India shifted to sugars and processed foods](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/25/why-rural-india-shifted-to-sugars-and-processed-foods/)

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/food/easy-access-longer-shelf-life-promotion-icrisat-finds-reasons-why-rural-india-shifted-to-sugars-carbs-91351)

 **Context:** A research study conducted by **the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT)** has revealed that **rural families in India are increasingly relying on carbohydrates and sugary processed foods** instead of **protein and micronutrient-rich options.**

**Key Findings:**

- The **shift from traditional diets** is attributed to factors **like limited access to such nutrient-rich foods and the ease of sourcing cheaper alternatives.**
- This transition is exacerbated by the **decreasing availability of wild foods from forests, which used to be part of their diet.**
- The research also points out that **rural-to-urban migration** leads to changes in **dietary habits as people are exposed to packaged foods heavily promoted in cities.**
- Sugary processed foods become popular due to **their convenience and longer shelf life compared to fresh fruits and vegetables.**

**Solutions:**

- The **study calls for policy interventions to strengthen nutrition-sensitive food supply chains**.
- ICRISAT suggests solutions that include **raising awareness about nutrition and educating people about healthy eating habits and the significance of locally grown foods**.
- The study **underscores the importance of traditional farming practices and local markets in ensuring access to nutritious food in rural areas**.

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/agriculture/-deficiency-in-micronutrients-in-soil-linked-to-health-of-children-and-women--91347#:~:text=Districts%20with%20an%20increased%20proportion%20of%20soil%20zinc,increase%20in%20the%20height%20of%20women%2C%20it%20said.)

 **Context:** A new study titled “**Soil micronutrients linked to human health in India**,” has revealed a significant connection between **soil micronutrients and the nutritional well-being of individuals, particularly children and adult women**.

**Key Findings:**

- The study found that **districts with a higher proportion of soil zinc samples showed notably lower rates of child stunting and underweight**.
- **Soil zinc availability was linked to increased height in women**.
- The research also highlighted a **strong correlation between soil iron availability and health outcomes, including anaemia among women and haemoglobin levels among both children and women.**

**Relevance to India:**

- Around 35**% of the country’s soil is estimated to be deficient in zinc**, and about 11**% is estimated to lack iron**.
- India accounts for a**bout one-third of the global population affected by micronutrient deficiencies**, as indicated by the **Global Nutrition Report 2018**.

The study suggests that **leveraging soil mineral availability could potentially help mitigate the prevalence of anaemia across a large portion of the population.**

**A severe drought in** [**Panama**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2017/06/14/insights-daily-current-affairs-14-june-2017/panama/) is causing extensive delays for cargo ships transiting the **Panama Canal,** a vital route connecting almost **2,000 ports across 170 countries**.

**About the** [**Panama Canal**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2013/10/25/geography-daily-answer-writing-challenge-day-6/)

The Panama Canal is an **82 km artificial waterway in Panama**, connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and dividing North and South America. It allows ships to avoid the lengthy and dangerous voyage around **Cape Horn**. Panama itself forms an **isthmus (**a narrow land strip connecting two larger landmasses**) between North and South America**.

**This differs from straits**, which are narrow waterways joining l**arger bodies of water, like the Strait of Gibraltar.**

The **canal lifts ships through locks to Gatun Lake** and then lowers them. Originally under **French control in the late 1800s,** the United States completed the project in **1914 and managed it until 1999** when Panama took over. It’s now operated by the **Panama Canal Authority.**
