 **Syllabus: Economic Geography**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/explained-india-and-the-northern-sea-route/article67230900.ece#:~:text=The%2010%2C500%20km%2Dlong%20CVMC,and%20Waterways%20Sarbananda%20Sonowal%2C%20who)

**Context:** The [Arctic region](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/03/21/india-and-the-arctic/#:~:text=The%20Arctic%20region%20comprises%20the,Arctic%20Council%2C%20an%20intergovernmental%20forum.) holds **significance for India** due to potential impacts on economic security, water security, and sustainability arising from climate change.

**What is the** [**Northern Sea Route**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/09/northern-sea-route-nsr/#:~:text=About%20Northern%20Sea%20Route%20(NSR,Strait%20between%20Siberia%20and%20Alaska.) **(NSR)?**

It is the **shortest shipping route** connecting Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. Spanning 5,600 km, it passes through **four seas of the Arctic Ocean**. The route starts at the boundary between the **Barents and Kara seas (Kara Strait) and concludes at the Bering Strait (Provideniya Bay).** The NSR offers potential distance **savings of up to 50% compared to existing shipping lanes via Suez or Panama.**

**How is Russia making the NSR navigable?**

Russia ensures the navigability of the [**Northern Sea Route (NSR)**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/09/northern-sea-route-nsr/#:~:text=About%20Northern%20Sea%20Route%20(NSR,Strait%20between%20Siberia%20and%20Alaska.) **by using icebreaking assistance,** as the Arctic Ocean remains icebound for most of the year. Russia maintains the world’s only **nuclear-powered icebreaker fleet.**

**The inaugural nuclear icebreaker, “Lenin,” operated from December 1959 for thirty years**. Today, the fleet of nuclear-powered icebreakers, overseen by Rosatom’s subsidiary FSUE Atomflot, ensures secure navigation on the Northern Sea Route (NSR).

**India’s participation in NSR development is driven by:**

- **Growing Cargo Traffic:** NSR cargo traffic increased by about **73% during 2018-2022.**
- **Strategic Transit Route**: India’s geographical location and reliance on sea transportation make the NSR a crucial transit route.
- [**Chennai-Vladivostok Maritime Corridor**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/28/chennai-vladivostok-maritime-route/#:~:text=Mapping&text=India%20and%20Russia%20are%20working,China%20Sea%2C%20and%20Malacca%20Strait.) **(CVMC):** This project, stemming from a 2019 memorandum of intent, **shortens transport time to 12 days** (almost reduced by a third). It allows efficient trade through the **Sea of Japan, the South China Sea, and Malacca Strait.**
- **Cargo Potential:** A study by **Chennai Port Trust shows CVMC** can import items like coking coal, crude oil, LNG, and fertilizers from Russia to India efficiently
- **Geopolitics:** India would like to complement China and Russia’s potential collective influence over NSR.

[**India’s engagement in the Arctic**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/26/mission-2024-insights-daily-current-affairs-pib-summary-26-august-2023/India%20and%20the%20Arctic)**:**

- **India’s engagement with the Arctic began when it signed the Svalbard Treaty** in February 1920 in Paris between Norway, the US, Denmark, France, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Great Britain, and Ireland, and the British overseas Dominions and Sweden concerning Spitsbergen. Ever since then, India has been closely monitoring all the developments in the Arctic region.
- **India initiated its Arctic research program in 2007**with a focus on climate change in the region.
    - The objectives included studying teleconnections between the **Arctic climate and the Indian monsoon,** to characterize sea ice in the Arctic using satellite data, and to estimate the effect on global warming.
- India has set up a research station **Himadri at Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard, in 2008**
- **In May 2013,**India became an **observer state of the Arctic Council** along with five others including China.
- **India launched its inaugural multi-sensor** moored observatory and northernmost atmospheric laboratory in **2014 and 2016 respectively**
- Till last year, **thirteen expeditions to the Arctic**were successfully conducted.

### [High Youth Unemployment in India](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/26/high-youth-unemployment-in-india/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus: Unemployment**

 **Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/how-infrastructure-investments-may-be-slowing-job-creation-8908158/)

 **Context:** Despite being the fastest-growing large economy, India faces the challenge of high **youth unemployment alongside economic growth**.

**What is** [**unemployment**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-economy-3/poverty-and-unemployment/unemployment/)**?**

Unemployment is a situation when a person actively searches for a job and is unable to find work. Unemployment indicates the health of the economy.

**According to the latest annual** [**Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS),**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/06/15/unemployment-has-decreased-says-labour-survey/) released by the National Statistical Office (NSO), India’s unemployment rate in July 2021-22 to **4.1%**

**Reason for High Unemployment in India Despite High Economic Growth:** 

- **Lop-Sided Development Policies**: India’s growth and unemployment coexist due to imbalanced policies that create fewer jobs for new labour force entrants.
- **Demographic Composition**: Over 50% of India’s population is below 25, and over 65% is below 35. Despite high growth, job creation hasn’t kept pace with this demographic.
- **Less Focus on Human Infrastructure**: India’s progress in physical infrastructure hasn’t been matched in education and skills. The absence of strong human infrastructure limits job growth.
- **Shift to Rural Manufacturing:** Urban-centric physical infrastructure investments conflict with manufacturing’s move to rural areas for cost competitiveness.
- **Constrained Growth in Rural Areas:** Poor physical and human infrastructure in rural areas hinders growth drivers and limits the size of the manufacturing sector.

**What is Human Infrastructure?**

Human infrastructure refers to the **development and investment in the education, skills, and capabilities of a population**. It encompasses efforts to improve literacy, vocational training, healthcare, and other factors that enhance the human capital and productivity of a society.

**Importance of Investing in Human Infrastructure:**

- **High Returns:** Education investment yields higher returns than physical investment. Social returns for primary education are around **20%, and returns for higher education are increasing.**
- **Job Creation Acceleration**: Education investments accelerate job creation. New enterprises, both domestic and foreign, seek skilled workers and strong physical infrastructure.
- **Youth Advantage**: India’s sizable youth population can significantly benefit from education, aligning with the needs of new enterprises.

**Recommendations:**

- **Address Lop-Sided Development Policies**
- **Improve Rural Human Infrastructure**
- **Scale Up Tertiary Education**
- **Promote Tier II Cities**: The focus of economic growth should shift to Tier II cities, where new job opportunities and GDP growth can be generated.
- **Address Urbanization and De-Industrialization Divergence**: Policymakers need to consider rural structural transformation that includes not only agricultural productivity but also the manufacturing sector.
- **Integrate Human and Physical Infrastructure**: To overcome the limitations of poor physical and human infrastructure in rural areas, a comprehensive approach that aligns both aspects is necessary for sustainable job growth.

**Conclusion:**

The challenges posed by the coexistence of **high economic growth and high unemployment can be overcome** by scaling up investments in both physical and human infrastructure, bridging the gap between urban and rural areas in India.

 **Ethics Case Study:**

**We’ll probably look back on 2022 as the year generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) exploded into public attention, as image-generating systems from OpenAI and Stability AI were released, prompting a flood of fantastical images on social media. Last week, researchers at Meta announced an AI system that can negotiate with humans and generate dialogue in a strategy game called Diplomacy. Venture capital investment in the field grew to $1.3 billion this year, according to Pitchbook, even as it contracted for other areas in tech.**

**The digital artist Beeple was shocked in August when several Twitter users generated their own versions of one of his paintings with AI-powered tools. Similar software can create music and videos. The broad term for all this is ‘generative AI’ and as we lurch to the digital future, familiar tech industry challenges like copyright and social harm are re-emerging.**

**Earlier this month, Meta unveiled Galactica, a language system specializing in science that could write research papers and Wikipedia articles. Within three days, Meta shut it down. Early testers found it was generating nonsense that sounded dangerously realistic, including instructions on how to make napalm in a bathtub and Wikipedia entries on the benefits of being Caucasian or how bears live in space. The eerie effect was facts mixed in so finely with hogwash that it was hard to tell the difference between the two. Political and health-related misinformation is hard enough to track when it’s written by humans.**

 **Context:** A study conducted by the **ICMR-National Institute of Nutrition (NIN)** has revealed that **cinnamon and its active components**, **cinnamaldehyde and procyanidin B2**, when administered orally to rats, exhibited an **inhibitory effect on early-stage prostate cancer**.

- The research aimed to evaluate the **chemo-preventive potential of cinnamon and its bioactive compounds** in male rats.

The study also suggested that these substances **could mitigate oxidative stress, reduce the spread of cancer cells in the prostate gland, and offer benefits to bone health**. However, further studies are required before dietary recommendations can be made based on these findings.

 **Context:** Two recent studies have employed honey bees as **effective biomonitoring tools to assess contamination in urban environments.**

- Honey bees were found to **effectively map** [**pollution**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/environment-pollution-and-control/air-pollution/what-is-pollution/) **patterns and reveal the most sensitive markers of contamination** **tracing toxic metals and antimicrobial resistance genes**.

**Process:**

**Bees’ foraging behaviour** allows them to pick up contaminants, offering insights into pollution patterns. They can reveal the **presence of toxic metals near pollution sources** and help understand factors contributing to contamination. Bees also aid in assessing the **spread of antimicrobial resistance genes,** which can be ingested from water bodies. This approach provides a valuable tool for monitoring pollution and addressing environmental health concerns.

These studies highlight the **importance of comprehensive monitoring to address environmental health challenges.**
