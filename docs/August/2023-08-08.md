####  **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: Governance**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/the-bureaucracy-as-prosecutor-and-judge/article67164770.ece#:~:text=The%20government%20cannot%20be%20a,of%20wrongdoing%20is%20constitutionally%20suspect.)

**Context**: The recently enacted [**Jan Vishwas Act, 2022**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/28/the-jan-vishwas-amendment-of-provisions-bill-2023/)**,** aimed at easing business regulations, transfers the authority to impose penalties for offences from the judiciary to the bureaucracy. This move has raised concerns **about the separation of powers**, as bureaucrats become both prosecutors and judges.

**What is** [**Separation of Power**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/02/13/the-doctrine-of-separation-of-powers/)**?**

Separation of Powers is a **fundamental principle in governance** where the powers of a government are **divided among different branches to prevent any one branch from having unchecked authority.** It ensures a system of **checks and balances**.

For example, in a democratic country, the **legislative, executive, and judicial branches** have distinct functions to prevent the concentration of power and ensure accountability.

**About the act:**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jan-1024x1024.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jan.png)

**Issues Related to Jan Vishwas Act:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Issues**|   |
|**Violates Separation of Power**|The legislation replaces **criminal imprisonment with monetary penalties** but **shifts the authority to impose penalties to the bureaucracy.**|
|It amends **environmental and pollution control Acts** to replace imprisonment with penalties, **decided by designated bureaucrats**|
|**A form of ‘quasi-decriminalization’:**|Critics argue the Act offers a form of **‘quasi-decriminalization’**, and more efforts are needed for **true decriminalization.**|
|**Technical competence of adjudicating officers**|Questions were raised about the **technical competence of adjudicating officers under the Act**, especially in environmental legal proceedings.|

**Status of division of powers between executive and judiciary in India:**

The division of powers between the judiciary and the executive is **not explicitly outlined in the Constitution**.

- **Article 50** instructs the state to achieve this separation over time.
- **Initially, the criminal magistracy** was part of the executive at Independence.
- It was only **around 1970 that certain State legislatures**, like West Bengal, enacted laws to separate the judicial and executive functions within the criminal magistracy under the [**Criminal Procedure Code**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/03/29/criminal-procedure-identification-bill/)**, 1898**

**The bureaucracy encroaches upon judicial power through various methods:**

- **Establishing Judicial Tribunals:** Ministries create judicial tribunals to take over judicial functions, often appointing bureaucrats as **“technical members”**
- **Creating Statutory Regulators**: The Union government establishes regulators like **SEBI and CCI** with the authority to impose substantial fines on private sector entities.
- **Appointing Adjudicatory Officers:** The government introduces **adjudicatory officers in legislation like the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, IT Act**, and Food Safety Act. These officers, who are bureaucrats, possess **powers to impose penalties or confirm property attachment orders.**

**Supreme Court Views:**

- A “judicial function” should only be **performed by an independent** judicial authority free from executive control.
- While there **is limited precedent on whether imposing penalties qualifies** as a “**judicial function**,” processes involving **fact-finding, applying the law, and determining punishment or compensation** fundamentally **constitute a judicial function.**

Hence, it’s the **government’s duty to present its case before an impartial judge** to guarantee citizens a fair trial before any penalty is imposed. The government cannot serve as both **prosecutor and judge in its own matter**.

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/explained-heres-how-asia-fared-in-2022-in-terms-of-climate-and-extreme-events/article67167316.ece)

 **Context:** The [World Meteorological Organisation (WMO)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/03/26/world-meteorological-organisation-wmo/#:~:text=What%20is%20it%3F,as%20oceanography%20and%20atmospheric%20chemistry.) has come up with its 2022 State of the Climate in Asia report, indicating that in 2022, Asia experienced extreme climate events, including high temperatures, droughts, floods, and cyclones, leading to significant socioeconomic impacts.

**Key points of the Report are:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Points**|**Examples and Impacts**|
|**Global Climate**|·        **The annual mean near-surface temperature** in 2022 was **1.15 °C** above pre-industrial average<br><br>·        **Ocean heat content** reached a new high<br><br>·        **Global mean sea level** reached a new high due to ocean warming and ice sheet loss.|
|**Temperature**|·        2022 had the **second or third-highest mean surface temperature** on record<br><br>·        **Northern Siberia, Central Asia, and Western China** experienced above-average temperatures|
|**Precipitation**|·        Regions in Iraq, **Ganges-Brahmaputra Rivers**, Korean Peninsula faced precipitation deficits<br><br>·        **South Pakistan, Southeast Asia**, and northeast China experienced excessive rainfall<br><br>·        **Central India and the Himalayas** recorded high precipitation<br><br>·        **Floods in Pakistan and India** displaced millions and damaged agriculture.|
|**Glaciers**|·        23 glaciers in **High Mountain Asia** showed a continued mass reduction<br><br>·        **Urumqi Glacier No 1 in Tien Shan** had the second most negative mass balance in 2021-22 (see explanation down)|
|**Extreme Events: Cyclones**|·        **25 tropical cyclones** formed in the western North Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea<br><br>·        **The Nanmadol typhoon** affected Japan, causing evacuation, deaths, and economic damage.|
|**Floods**|·        Severe floods in Pakistan **displaced 14% of the population**, causing deaths and displacements.<br><br>·        Heavy monsoon affected **Northeast India and Bangladesh**, causing deaths and destruction<br><br>·        Floods were **India’s worst natural disaster in 2022**|
|**Droughts**|·        **The Yangtze River basin in China** experienced the worst drought in six decades, impacting crops, energy, and economy<br><br>·        **Iran faced its third consecutive year of drought**, leading to decreasing water bodies and economic loss.|
|**Economic Impact**|·        **Floods in Pakistan, China, and India** caused economic losses exceeding the average observed over 20 years<br><br>·        **Droughts in China and Iran** resulted in significant economic damages<br><br>·        **Cyclones and storms** led to milder economic losses compared to previous years.|

**What is “Negative mass balance” for glaciers?**

It refers to a situation in which the **amount of ice or snow lost from a glacier or ice sheet through melting,** sublimation, or other processes exceeds the amount of new ice or snow accumulation. In other words, the **glacier is losing more mass than it is gaining**, resulting in a decrease in its overall size and volume over time.

**About World Meteorological Organization:**

The World Meteorological Organization (founded 1950; HQ: Geneva; Parent organization: United Nations Economic and Social Council) is a **specialized agency of the United Nations** responsible for promoting international cooperation on atmospheric science, climatology, hydrology and geophysics.

### [Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Bill, 2023](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/08/mines-and-minerals-development-and-regulation-amendment-bill-2023/)

#### **GS3/GS1 Paper**

 **Syllabus: Issues related to Development, Mineral and Energy Resources**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/explained-the-push-to-bring-the-private-sector-into-mineral-exploration/article67168185.ece#:~:text=The%20story%20so%20far%3A%20On,seated%20minerals%20in%20the%20country.)

 **Context**: Parliament passed the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Bill, 2023, (MMDR Amendment) in a bid to **attract private sector investment** in the exploration of critical and deep-seated minerals in the country.

**What are critical and deep-seated minerals?**

- [**Critical Minerals**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/21/critical-minerals-resilient-supply-chains/): Critical minerals are natural resources that are essential for various industries, including technology, manufacturing, and clean energy. E.g., Lithium, nickel, cobalt etc.
- **Deep-Seated Minerals**: Deep-seated minerals refer to minerals that are found deep within the Earth’s crust and are typically more challenging and costly to explore and mine compared to minerals closer to the surface. E.g., Gold, Copper, Diamonds etc.

**India’s import dependency for critical and deep-seated minerals:**

India is **highly dependent on imports for critical and deep-seated minerals** like

- **100% dependency**: lithium, cobalt, nickel, niobium, beryllium, tantalum,
- **Very high dependency**: copper, zinc, lead, gold, silver, platinum group elements (PGEs), and diamonds.

**India’s current status:**

- India is the **world’s 4th largest producer of iron ore** and the **2nd largest producer of coal** as of 2021.
- India is the **second-largest producer** of **Aluminium** globally
- India’s mineral demand is projected to **rise by 3% in 2023**, fuelled by **expanded electrification** efforts and overall economic growth

**The issue with the import dependency:**

This import dependency poses challenges due to **vulnerabilities in global supply chains** and the potential for supply disruptions and increased prices. Moreover, the cost of importing these minerals is rising for India.

**Private sector participation is crucial for the exploration of critical and deep-seated minerals in India due to:**

- **Geological Potential**: India has substantial geological potential for hosting valuable mineral resources, similar to mining-rich regions globally.
- **Limited Exploration**: India has explored only a small fraction of its geological potential, with **less than 2% of known** resources being mined.
- **Government Dominance:** Exploration efforts have been largely led by government agencies like the **Geological Survey of India and Mineral Exploration Corporation Limited**, with limited private sector involvement.
- **Complex Exploration Techniques**: Mineral exploration demands specialized techniques like aerial surveys, geological mapping, and geochemical analyses.
    - These operations are resource-intensive, time-consuming, and carry financial risks.

**Background**

- **The MMDR Act, 1957** has undergone several amendments to address various issues in the mineral sector.
- **Amendments in 2015** introduced auction-based mineral allocation, established DMF for community welfare, and NMET for exploration promotion.
- **Amendments in 2016, 2020, and 2021** focused on emerging challenges and reforms, including **removing the captive vs. merchant mine distinction.**

**Need for further Amendment:**

The mineral sector requires **more reforms, particularly in exploring and mining Critical Minerals crucial** for economic growth and national security. **Limited availability** and **extraction concentration** of these minerals poses supply chain vulnerabilities and disruptions. Critical minerals have gained importance due to India’s **energy transition commitment and goal of achieving Net-Zero emissions by 2070.**

**Key provisions of Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Bill, 2023**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Key Provisions**|**MMDR Act 1957**|**MMDR Amendment Bill**|
|**Private Sector to Mine Atomic Minerals**|Limited to State agencies for exploration.|Allows the private sector to mine 6 atomic minerals- lithium, beryllium, niobium, titanium, tantalum and zirconium.|
|The central government can **auction mining leases and composite licences** for critical minerals.|
||||
|**Auction for Exploration Licence**|No provision for an exploration licence auction.|**The state government grants licences** through competitive bidding, while the Central government prescribes **auction details.**|
||||
||||
|**Maximum Area in which Activities are**|**Prospecting licence**: Up to 25 sq. km.|Bill allows activities under **a single exploration licence** in an area of up to 1,000 square kilometres.|
|**Incentive for Exploration Licence**||The state conducts **auctions for mining leases** if resources are proven after exploration. **Licensee receives a share** in the auction value of the mining lease for prospected minerals.|

**Mines and Minerals Bill 2023 endeavours to stimulate private sector involvement through:**

- **Expanding Mining Opportunities**: The Bill excludes six atomic minerals that were previously reserved exclusively for government entities
- **Enabling Exploration Activities**: The Bill overturns the Act’s prohibition on certain exploration activities like pitting, trenching, drilling, and sub-surface excavation.
- **Introduction of Exploration License (EL):** The Bill introduces a new exploration license (EL) aimed at promoting reconnaissance-level and prospective-stage exploration by private players.
- **Defining Exploration Area**: The Bill specifies the maximum exploration area, allowing activities within 1,000 square kilometres under a single exploration license.
- **Central Government Auctions**: The Bill empowers the central government to conduct auctions for **composite licenses and mining leases** specifically for critical and strategic minerals.

**Case study:**

In countries like Australia, private junior explorers take risks to discover potential mines and subsequently sell them to larger mining companies, fostering greater participation and multiplying exploration efforts.

**Some potential issues and concerns raised by industry experts:**

- **Delayed Revenue Generation**: Private companies’ revenue from exploration depends on **premium shares after mine auctions**, subject to government clearance timelines and potential delays due to deposit complexity and geography. This could impact exploration project viability.
- **Uncertainty in Revenue**: Explorers might not know their revenue until mine auction success, dissuading potential private participation due to unclear investment returns during exploration.
- **Auctioning Challenges:** Auctioning exploration licenses is complex as the value of undiscovered resources is uncertain. This may reduce private sector interest due to unpredictability in the auction process.
- **Government Control over Discoveries**: The policy limits private explorers to sharing premiums post-discovery, instead of selling discoveries directly. This contrasts with global practices where private explorers can sell findings to mining companies.
- **Investment Assurance:** Companies may hesitate to invest significantly in exploration due to uncertainty about utilizing discoveries, affecting capital investment incentives.

Also, the Ministry of Mines, in June this year, came out **with a list of** [**30 minerals critical**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/29/critical-minerals-list/) to the country’s economic development and national security.
