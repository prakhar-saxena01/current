### [Renouncing Indian citizenship](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/23/renouncing-indian-citizenship/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: Citizenship**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/indian-citizenship-renounce-passport-leave-explainer-immigration-immigration-india/article67208636.ece#:~:text=People%20giving%20up%20Indian%20citizenship,in%20business%20and%20educational%20activities.)

 **Context:**  A growing number of Indians are **relinquishing their** [**citizenship**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/01/10/citizenship-amendment-act-rules/#:~:text=The%20Citizenship%20Act%2C1955%20provides,of%20the%20territory%20into%20India.), primarily seeking better economic opportunities and social security abroad.

**What does Data show?** 

- **Over 15 lakh Indians** have given up **their citizenship in the past decade**, with many heading to the United States.
- **High-net-worth individuals** are also leaving India (through investment migration), with around **6,500 expected** to move out this year, making it the second-highest net outflow globally after China.
- **The USA** remains the most preferred destination, followed by Canada, Australia, and the UK.
- The MEA estimated the number of Indian nationals living abroad to be around **1.2 crore in 2021**

**Reasons for Renouncing Citizenship:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Reasons**|**Explanation**|
|**Better Economic Opportunities**|Seeking improved job prospects and higher income abroad.|
|**Improved Social Security**|Looking for better healthcare, education, and social welfare benefits in the new country.|
|**Lifestyle Considerations**|Pursuing a better quality of life, safety, and overall living standards.|
|**Friendly Tax Legislation**|Opting for countries with favourable tax laws and reduced financial burdens.|
|**Education Opportunities**|Accessing higher education and specialized programs is not available in the home country.|
|**Ease of Mobility**|Obtaining a passport that allows **visa-free travel** to more destinations globally.|
|**Political Stability**|Escaping political instability, conflict, or governance issues in the home country.|
|**Environmental Factors**|Moving to places with better environmental conditions and climate.|
|**Family Reasons**|Reuniting with family members already settled in another country.|
|**Investment and Business Opportunities**|Exploring entrepreneurial ventures or investment opportunities abroad.|

**What is Citizenship?**

Citizenship is the **legal and social relationship** between an individual and a state, signifying full membership and allegiance to that state.

- In India, there **are citizens and aliens**, with citizens being integral members of the nation and enjoying all civil and political rights.
- This concept of citizenship creates an **exclusionary distinction from non-citizens**.
- **The Citizenship Act of 1955** prescribes **five ways of acquiring citizenship,** viz, birth, descent, registration, naturalisation and incorporation of territory.

**Principle of Citizenship:**

Two widely recognized principles determine the granting of citizenship: “**jus soli,”** which grants citizenship based on place of birth, and “**jus sanguinis**,” which considers blood ties.

- India has leaned towards the **concept of jus soli** since the days of the Motilal Nehru Committee in 1928, rejecting the **racial notion of jus sanguinis** as it contradicted Indian values and ethos.

**Ways to** [**Renounce Citizenship in India**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/12/02/renunciation-of-indian-citizenship/)**:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Ways**|**Details**|
|**Voluntary Renunciation**|An Indian citizen of full age and capacity can relinquish citizenship through their will.|
|When an individual gives up citizenship, minor children also lose Indian citizenship but can regain it at 18.|
|**By Termination**|India follows single citizenship, meaning one can be a citizen of only one country at a time.|
|If a person becomes a citizen of another country, Indian citizenship automatically ends, except during war.|
|**Deprivation by Government**|Government can terminate citizenship if a citizen:|
|o   Disrespects the Constitution|
|o   Acquired citizenship through fraud|
|o   Illegally traded or communicated with the enemy during war|
|o   Is sentenced to over 2 years in prison within 5 years of registration or naturalization|
|o   Lives outside India for 7 consecutive years|

**Conclusion:**

A **successful, prosperous, and influential diaspora** is an advantage for India, and our approach is to tap diaspora networks and utilise its reputation for national gain. The Government’s efforts are particularly aimed at encouraging the exchange of knowledge and expertise in a manner that would contribute to India’s national development

### [Lily Thomas case and Section 8(4) of RPA](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/23/lily-thomas-case-and-section-84-of-rpa/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: RPA 1951**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/a-strong-case-to-restore-section-84-of-the-rp-act/article67224103.ece)

 **Context:** The article discusses the **implications of** [**the Lily Thomas case’s**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/20/editorial-analysis-the-curious-case-of-the-disqualification-of-a-politician/) **judgment** that invalidated Section 8(4) of the Representation of People Act.

**What is Lily Thomas case’s about and its judgement?**

**The Lily Thomas case** pertains to the Supreme Court of India’s judgment that **invalidated** [**Section 8(4) of the Representation of People Act**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/governance/elections-in-india/acts-associated-with-elections-in-india/salient-features-of-the-representation-of-peoples-act-1951/#:~:text=A%20fourth%20subsection%2C%20i.e.%2C%208,3%20months%20of%20their%20conviction.). This provision allowed **a three-month period for convicted legislators** to appeal before disqualification.

- The court’s ruling led to **instant disqualification** upon conviction, impacting the careers of sitting legislators.
- The judgment was based on the premise that **Article 102(1) doesn’t distinguish between sitting members and candidates** for disqualification.

[**Disqualification of MPs and MLAs**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/27/editorial-analysis-making-sense-of-the-disqualification-of-a-lok-sabha-mp/) **under RPA, 1951:**

- **Section 8(3) disqualifies MPs and MLAs** convicted and **jailed for 2+ years**, leading to **6-year disqualification** after release.
    - Convicted individuals on bail with pending appeals are **ineligible for contesting elections.**
- **Section 8(4)** previously allowed convicted legislators to continue if they appealed **within 3 months**.
    - In Lily Thomas’s case, Supreme Court, July 2013, declared 8(4) unconstitutional, disqualifying on the date of conviction.

**Issues with the Judgment in Lily Thomas Case:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Issues**|**Description**|
|**1. Instant Disqualification**|E.g., Recently **Rahul Gandhi** was disqualified immediately after his conviction in a defamation case.|
|**2. Adverse impact on Legislators**|Legislators lose their seats due to quick disqualification without proper recourse.|
|**3. Insufficient time for the appeal process**|Limited time for legislators to appeal and present their case for reversal.|
|**4. Slow court procedures**|Courts take extended periods for handling appeals, creating undue delays.|
|**5. Differential Treatment**|**Article 103** allows differentiation between sitting members and candidates for disqualification.|
|**6. Role of President**|The suggested authority for declaring disqualification lies with the President under Article 103|
|**7. Uncertainty about staying sentence/conviction**|Whether staying only sentence or both sentence and conviction can lift disqualification.|
|**8. Limited impact on behaviour**|**No significant change was observed in politicians’ criminal records and behaviour** due to the judgment.|

**Measures needed to address the issues arising from the judgment in the Lily Thomas case:**

- **Review and Amendment**: Consider amending section 8(4) of RPA, allowing a reasonable period for appeal before disqualification takes effect.
- **Clear Guidelines:** Establish clear guidelines for the application of disqualification, including the role of the President in declaring disqualification.
- **Timely Appeals**: Implement measures to expedite the appeals process to ensure that legislators have a fair and timely opportunity to present their cases.
- **Constitutional Safeguards**: Consider introducing a constitutional amendment in Article 102 that provides **protection against abrupt disqualifications**.

### [Multilateral Development Banks and issues with global financial safety institutions](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/23/multilateral-development-banks-and-issues-with-global-financial-safety-institutions/)

#### **GS2/GS3 Paper** 

 **Syllabus: International Institutions and their working**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/financial-safety-free-capital-flows-fixed-exchange-rates-gold-standard-global-economic-powers-8902843/)

 **Context:** The article discusses that in the absence of significant governance reform, global financial safety institutions such as [World Bank and IMF](https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-economy-3/foreign-trade-and-international-organizations/imf-and-world-bank/) are losing effectiveness.

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/financial.png)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/financial.png)

**What are** [**Multilateral development banks**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/30/multilateral-development-banks/#:~:text=What%20is%20MDB%3F,Bank%2C%20Asian%20Development%20Bank%20etc.) **(MDB)?**

They are **international financial institutions** for the purpose of encouraging economic development in poorer nations. MDBs provide loans and grants to member nations to fund projects that support social and economic development.

**Role of Multilateral development banks in global stability and development**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Role**|**Examples**|
|**Funding Development Projects**|ADB’s support for Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor; World Bank’s assistance in National Waterway 1 on the Ganges River|
|**Crisis Management**|IMF provides financial assistance during economic crises; World Bank’s support to India during the COVID-19 pandemic|
|**Supporting** [**SDG**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/India-and-Sustainable-Development-Goals-SDGs.pdf) **Implementation**|World Bank grants for education and healthcare programs; Alignment of national policies with SDGs|
|**Policy Advice and Capacity Building**|IMF’s macroeconomic policy advice; Technical assistance for governance improvement|

**Despite playing a crucial role in promoting development and global stability, multilateral development banks (MDBs) face several challenges that need to be addressed.**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MDBs.jpg)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MDBs.jpg)

**What are India’s Options?**

**India’s options** within the evolving global financial safety net involve:

- Relying on [**bilateral swap lines**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/12/02/currency-swap-arrangement/#:~:text=RBI%20would%20enter%20into%20bilateral,signing%20the%20bilateral%20swap%20agreements.) with Japan and the IMF during macroeconomic and external crises.
- Enhancing its financial safety
- India should consider joining the “[**Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralisation**](https://aric.adb.org/initiative/chiang-mai-initiative).”
- India should persist in **building substantial foreign exchange reserves** for self-insurance. **Caution** is advised in **opening the capital account**, particularly to volatile debt inflows into its bond market.

**Conclusion:**

The future global financial system is uncertain. The ongoing [**16th quota review of IMF**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/14/imf-quota-review/) might not lead to increased quotas for emerging economies, as major member countries might not agree. With limited IMF governance reform prospects, its significance and effectiveness could decline.

### [Debt-Fossil Fuel Trap Report](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/23/debt-fossil-fuel-trap-report/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus: Environment Conservation**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/rich-countries-force-poor-nations-rely-fossil-fuels-8904371/)

 **Context:** Poor countries burdened with heavy debts are **compelled to rely on** [**fossil fuels**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/09/11/impact-of-fossil-fuel-extraction-on-global-warming/) **to generate revenue** for repaying loans from richer nations, highlights the Debt-Fossil Fuel Trap report.

- **The Debt-Fossil Fuel Trap** report has been released by the **anti-debt campaigner’s Debt Justice and partners** in affected countries.

**Findings of the Report “The Debt-Fossil Fuel Trap”:**

- **Fossil fuel extraction** is seen as a means to generate revenue and alleviate debt for countries in the global south
    - **Example of Suriname**: **Resource-Based Loans**: Creditors are entitled to **30% of oil revenue** until 2050, incentivizing continued oil exploitation.
    - **Argentina** supports fracking in **Vaca Muerta (Northern Patagonia)** to ease the debt crisis.
- **Revenues from fossil fuel projects** often fall short of expectations, leading to further debt.
- External debt payments for global south countries have risen by 150% between 2011 and 2023, reaching a 25-year high
- **54 countries in a debt crisis**, cutting public spending during the pandemic to repay loans
- **Extreme weather events** force countries to borrow more money for adaptation and mitigation efforts.
    - **For instance, Dominica’s debt** as a percentage of GDP rose from 68% to 78% after Hurricane Maria hit the island in 2017.

**The report recommends the following actions to address the issues highlighted:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Recommendations**|**Description**|
|**Ambitious Debt Cancellation**|Implement comprehensive debt cancellation for countries in need, across all creditors, without imposing economic conditions.|
|**Transition to Clean Energy**|Encourage the adoption of clean and renewable energy sources to reduce dependency on fossil fuels.|
|**Wealthy Government Support**|Wealthy governments and institutions should play a role in supporting countries to exit the debt-fossil fuel trap.|
|**Sustainable Development**|Promote sustainable development strategies that prioritize environmental protection and economic stability.|
|**Ethical Investment**|Ensure that financing and investments align with environmental and social sustainability, rather than contributing to fossil fuel dependence.|
|**Equitable Financing**|Offer fair and just financing terms that do not exacerbate debt burdens or perpetuate reliance on fossil fuels.|

**Source:** [**HBL**](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/cerc-floats-paper-on-market-coupling-seeks-stakeholder-response/article67220170.ece)

**Context**: The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission ([CERC](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/30/draft-carbon-credit-trading-scheme/)) has released a staff paper on implementing market coupling in India’s power sector.

**What is Market coupling?**

Market coupling is **a process in the energy sector** where bids from various power exchanges are matched to **determine a uniform market** clearing price for electricity trading.

- It aims to **optimize transmission infrastructure** use, maximize economic surplus, and create simultaneous benefits for both buyers and sellers.
- This process helps in **efficient price discovery and integration of different electricity markets** or geographies, promoting transparency and competition in the energy trading sector.

**The CERC (Central Electricity Regulatory Commission)** has introduced provisions for market coupling among power exchanges in the country under its **CERC Power Market Regulations (PRC) 2021**. However, these provisions are yet to be officially implemented.

**The benefits of market coupling include:**

- Optimal utilization of transmission infrastructure.
- Maximization of economic surplus by considering all bid types leads to the creation of simultaneous benefits for both buyers and sellers.

 **India has three power exchanges**:

- **Indian Energy Exchange (IEX): 90% market share**
- **Power Exchange of India (PXIL)**
- **Hindustan Power Exchange (HPX)**

**Context:** A **preliminary proposal for the feasibility of establishing an elephant reserve** in the Gondia-Gadchiroli region of **east Maharashtra has been submitted** in response to the frequent **movement of elephants in the area.**

- Given the frequent movement of elephants along the borders of **Gondia, Gadchiroli, and Chhattisgarh,** the establishment of an **elephant reserve would aid the forest department in managing development more effectively.**
- Maharashtra has a relatively **small elephant population, making the establishment of an elephant reserve crucial for their protection**.

This initiative follows the Maharashtra government’s 2020 decision to **designate nearly 3,000 hectares of forest land as an elephant reserve in the Sindhudurg district**, marking the first instance of such a reserve being established in the state.
