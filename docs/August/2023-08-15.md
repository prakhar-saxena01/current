#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: Government Policies and Interventions**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/why-doctors-are-protesting-rule-to-prescribe-generic-drugs-8892886/)**,** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/doctors-new-national-medical-commission-guidelines-8890632/)

 **Context:** The [National Medical Commission](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/09/26/national-medical-commission-2/#:~:text=About%20the%20National%20Medical%20Commission,appointed%20by%20the%20Central%20government.) (NMC) has issued comprehensive guidelines for the **professional conduct of registered doctors in India under The NMC Registered Medical Practitioner (professional conduct) Regulations 2023**

**Some key points from the guidelines include:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Aspect**|**Guidelines**|
|**Use of Social Media**|**Doctors can use social media** for providing information or announcements|
|The information **must be verifiable and not misleading.**|
|The guideline warns **against soliciting patients through social media**|
|**Prohibited**: discussing patient treatment specifics, and sharing patient scans online. **Patient privacy** must be maintained|
|Advised to **follow decorum when interacting online**|
|**Prescription Practices**|Doctors required to **prescribe** [**generic medicines**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/tag/generic-medicines/)|
|Exceptions for cases **requiring specific brand names** due to narrow therapeutic index or exceptional situations|
|Encouraged to educate patients about the **equivalence of generic and branded medicines**|
|**Right to Refuse Treatment**|**Doctors have the right to refuse treatment** for abusive, unruly, or violent patients and relatives|
|**Must not refuse treatment** in medical emergencies|
|**Prohibited from discrimination** based on various grounds.|
|**Continuous Professional Development**|Doctors mandated to **undergo continuous learning throughout** active years|
|**Accumulate 30 credit points** in relevant fields every five years|
|**Annual sessions** of at **least three credits** (ideally six)|
|**No more than 50%** of training online|
|**Professional Conduct**|**Doctors prohibited** from participating in **conferences**, CPD sessions sponsored by **pharmaceutical companies**|
|Each Doctor shall **display the unique registration ID** assigned to them in **prescriptions, certificates, and money receipts** given to patients.|
|Doctors cannot be involved in **fee splitting, commission from diagnostic services, endorsement** of a product or person, operating an open to all medical stores, etc|
|**Prohibited from receiving gifts, hospitality, or monetary benefits** from pharmaceutical companies, medical device companies, or corporate hospitals.|
|**Disciplinary action**|Five levels of **disciplinary actions** ranging from warning to permanent debar from practice for RMP|

**Issues with the guidelines:**

**Related to** [**Generic Medicines**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/tag/generic-medicines/)**:**

- **Quality of Generic Medicines**: Doctors express concerns about the quality of generic medicines available
- **Limited Availability of Generic Medicines**: The availability of these medicines in pharmacies is limited due to low-profit margins.
- **Ineffectiveness of Generic Substitutes**: Since the quality of generic medicines can vary across companies, prescribing generics without standardized quality control might lead to ineffective treatments.
- **Loss of Doctor’s Choice:** Doctors might lose the ability to prescribe the best-suited medication for a patient, considering their medical history and specific needs.

**Other issues:**

- **Consultation Fees Disclosure**: While doctors must disclose consultation fees upfront, estimating **surgical or treatment costs** accurately might be challenging.
- **CPD Implementation:** The requirement for Continuous Professional Development (CPD) might burden doctors with **additional training**
- **Sponsorship Restrictions**: The prohibition of pharmaceutical industry sponsorship for conferences and educational activities could **limit the availability of educational opportunities for doctors.**
- **Patient Privacy:** Balancing **social media use with patient privacy** might be complex, as even images posted online can be owned by social media companies or the public.

**What are Generic medicines?**

They are **pharmaceutical products that are equivalent to brand-name drugs** in terms of **active ingredients, dosage, strength, route of administration**, quality, and intended use. Generic medicines provide **cost-effective alternatives** to branded drugs while maintaining the same therapeutic effects.

**Examples of generic medicines include:**

- Paracetamol: Generic version of the brand-name drug Tylenol.
- Amlodipine: Generic version of the brand-name drug Norvasc.

### [Scheduled Caste (SC) status for Dalit Christians](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/15/scheduled-caste-sc-status-for-dalit-christians/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: Government Policies and Interventions**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/dalit-christians-exclusion-by-society-church-state/article67190986.ece#:~:text=This%20description%20helps%20form%20the%20basis%20of%20understanding,exclusion%20by%20society%2C%20the%20church%20and%20the%20state.)

 **Context:** The Union Government established a commission, led by former **Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan**, to **explore the possibility of granting** [**Scheduled Caste (SC) status**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/issues-related-to-sc-st/scheduled-caste/) **to Dalit Christians**.

- The Tamil Nadu Assembly passed a resolution to **amend the 1950 Presidential (SC) order to include them.**
- The **Justice Ranganath Misra Commission (2007)** and **studies by Deshpande and Bapna (2008) favoured extending reservation benefits to Dalit Christians.**

**Hindu Dalits converted to Christianity to escape caste-based discrimination but haven’t achieved the expected equality due to lingering social hierarchies**. The article highlights the need to recognize the unique struggles of Dalit Christians through the **“Theory of Intersectionality**,” which considers **multiple forms of oppression like race, gender, and religion intersecting**.

The term **“Dalit Christians”** reflects a **distinct identity, challenging the misconception that conversion erases caste discrimination**. The legal framework’s focus on **single-axis categorization has led to exclusion, and amending the SC list through the 1950 order is proposed as a solution.**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Constitutional Provisions**|**Description**|
|**Article 15(4)**|Special provisions for the **advancement of Scheduled Castes (SCs) and** [**Scheduled Tribes (STs).**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/issues-related-to-sc-st/scheduled-tribe/#:~:text=The%20National%20Commission%20for%20Scheduled,our%20country%20from%20other%20communities.)|
|**Article 16(4A)**|Provides for **reservation in promotion to certain posts in favour of SCs/STs** where they are underrepresented.|
|**Article 17**|**Abolishes Untouchability**, ensuring the elimination of caste-based discrimination.|
|**Article 46**|Mandates the State to promote the educational and economic interests of weaker sections, **particularly SCs and STs, and protect them from social injustice and exploitation.**|
|**Article 335**|**Requires considering the claims of SCs and STs in appointments to services and posts, balancing with administrative efficiency.**|
|**Article 330 and Article 332**|Reserves seats in the **House of the People (Parliament) and legislative assemblies of States respectively for SCs and STs.**|
|**Part IX and Part IXA of the Constitution**|Envisages and provides reservations for **SCs and STs in local bodies (Panchayats and Municipalities).**|

[/su_note]

**Who is included in the Constitution Order of 1950?**

- When enacted, the **Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order of 1950, initially provided for recognising only Hindus (with exceptions) as SCs**, to address the **social disability arising out of the practice of untouchability**.
- The Order was **amended in 1956 to include Dalits who had converted to Sikhism (in entirety) and once more in 1990 to include Dalits who had converted to Buddhism**. Both amendments were aided by the reports of the Kaka Kalelkar Commission in 1955 and the **High-Powered Panel (HPP) on Minorities, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in 1983 respectively.**
- **The Union government in 2019 rejected the possibility of including Dalit Christians as members of SCs,** rooting the exclusion on an Imperial Order of 1936 of the then colonial government, which had first **classified a list of the Depressed Classes and specifically excluded “Indian Christians” from it.**

**Why are Dalit Christians excluded?**

- The Office of the Registrar General of India (RGI) had cautioned the government that **SC status is meant for communities suffering from social disabilities arising out of the practice of untouchability, which it noted was prevalent in Hindu and Sikh communities.**
- It also noted that such a move **would significantly swell the population of SCs across the country.**
- In 2001, RGI referred to a 1978 note and added that like Dalit Buddhists, Dalits who converted to Islam or Christianity belonged to different sets of caste groups and not just one, as a result of which they cannot be categorised as a **“single ethnic group”, which is required by Clause (2) of Article 341 for inclusion.**

### [Drought Declaration Norms](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/15/drought-declaration-norms/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus: Disaster management**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/bangalore/karnataka-centre-re-evaluate-drought-declaration-norms-8890983/#:~:text=In%20a%20letter%20to%20Union,agricultural%20practices%20to%20declare%20drought.)

 **Context:** Amid an extended dry period of monsoon rain, Karnataka has written to the Central government, **urging a reevaluation of drought declaration norms**.

**What are** [**Droughts**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/05/12/drought-in-numbers-2022-report/#:~:text=Water%20scarcity%20and%20Drought%20in,that%20of%20sub%2DSaharan%20Africa.)**?**

Drought is defined as a **deficiency in rainfall/precipitation** over an extended period, causing adverse impacts on vegetation, animals, and people. There is **no single, legally accepted definition of drought in India**, with states having their own criteria.

- **74% of India’s districts** are vulnerable to extreme drought situations

**Process of Drought Declaration in India:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Steps**|**Process Description**|
||State Governments **have the authority to declare drought-affected regions**.|
|**1**|The first step involves examining two mandatory indicators:<br><br>·        **Rainfall deviation**<br><br>·        **Dry spell**|
|**2**|The second step involves **evaluating four impact indicators**: agriculture, vegetation indices (remote sensing), soil moisture, and hydrology. **States may choose any three of the four impact indicators (one from each)** to assess drought intensity and categorize it as severe or moderate.|
|**3**|**If all three chosen impact indicators are in the ‘severe’ category**, it indicates severe drought. If **two of the three chosen impact indicators** are in the ‘moderate’ or ‘severe’ category, it indicates moderate drought.|
|**4**|After the previous triggers are set off, **States conduct a sample survey on the ground to determine the final intensity of drought.** Field verification findings determine if the drought is **‘severe’ or ‘moderate’**.|
|**5**|Once the intensity of the drought is determined, the **state government issues a notification specifying the geographical extent of the drought-affected area.** The notification is valid for six months unless de-notified earlier.|

**Issues with the Drought Declaration process in India:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Issue**|**Description**|
|**One-Size-Fits-All Approach**|The existing norms for drought declaration follow a uniform approach without considering the **diverse challenges faced in different agro-climatic regions of the state.**|
|**Lack of Local Ecological Factors**|The current criteria **do not account for local ecological factors**, water availability, and agricultural practices, which vary across regions and impact drought severity.|
|**Inadequate Capturing of Distress**|The **Manual for Drought Management integrates** meteorological, agricultural, and hydrological aspects but fails to adequately address agricultural distress in rural areas.|
|**Rainfall Deficit Recovery**|The manual’s focus on rainfall deficit recovery overlooks the **impact of scanty rainfall** during the initial sowing season, causing agricultural damage and triggering drought.|
|**Rigid Definition of Dry Spells**|**The existing three to four-week dry spell definition** does not consider variations in soil type, crop variety, temperatures, and vegetative state that influence crop damage.|

**Suggestions:**

- Karnataka has proposed **region-specific criteria** that take into account local ecological factors, water availability, and agricultural practices for declaring drought.
- **Redefining dry spells** from the current **three to four weeks** to less than two weeks of consecutive dry spells.
- **Factors such as soil type, crop variety, temperatures**, and vegetative state must be considered, as even a two-week dry spell can lead to irreversible crop damage.

**Conclusion:**

There must be a balance between the need for accurate assessments and resource allocation, and the need for a flexible approach to address unique challenges and requirements in different regions within the state.

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/droupadi-murmu-matangini-hazra-kanaklata-barua-who-were-these-freedom-fighters-8892591/) 

**Context**: President Droupadi Murmu, **during her address on the eve of Independence Day, paid tribute to** [**women freedom fighters**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/13/women-and-nation-building-1857-to-the-republic/). She mentioned **two notable figures:**

**Matangini Hazra:** Born in **1869 in a village near Tamluk, West Bengal**, she was married at a young age and became widowed by 18. **After her husband’s death, she dedicated herself to social causes and became deeply involved in the Nationalist movement**, supporting Mahatma Gandhi’s ideals. Hazra participated in various protests, **including the Civil Disobedience Movement and the Salt March.**

- **During the Quit India Movement in 1942, at the age of 73, she led a large procession of around 6,000 protesters, advocating for the takeover of the Tamluk police station**. In the ensuing clash with British **authorities, she was shot and killed, becoming a martyr for the cause of Indian independence**.

**Kanaklata Barua:** Kanaklata Barua was a young martyr of the Quit India Movement and a symbol of courage and determination. At just 17 years **old, she led the Mrityu Bahini, a group of freedom fighters, in an attempt to hoist the Tricolour at the Gohpur police station in Assam on September 20, 1942**. Despite her age, she **was determined to lead the procession, and her brave efforts left a lasting impact**.

- During the confrontation with the police, **she was shot and killed while holding onto the flag**. Her sacrifice inspired many during a time when women’s involvement in the freedom struggle was gaining momentum. **In 2020, a Coast Guard vessel was named after her as a tribute to her bravery.**

These women, Matangini Hazra and Kanaklata Barua **exemplified the spirit of India’s struggle for independence and their contributions continue to be honoured and remembered.**
