**Context**: Parliament Standing Committee on Social Justice and Empowerment in India has recommended conducting a survey to assess the **impact of** [**drug abuse on society**.](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/07/kerala-has-a-drug-problem-300-jump-in-cases-over-six-years-arrests-increased-by-90/)

In 2018, the ministry commissioned a national survey conducted by the **National Drug Dependence Treatment Centre (NDDTC) AIIMS**, which formed the basis of the [**National Action Plan for Drug Demand Reduction**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/01/17/national-action-plan-for-drug-demand-reduction-2018-2023/) **(NAPDDR)** to address drug abuse in the country.

**What is Drug Abuse?** 

Drug abuse refers to the **excessive, inappropriate, or harmful use of legal or illegal** substances, leading to negative physical, mental, social, and behavioural consequences.

**Findings of the Panel:**

- **No comprehensive study or survey** has been conducted by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment to assess the **impact of drug abuse on society**.

### [Coastal Aquaculture Authority (Amendment) Bill, 2023](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/09/coastal-aquaculture-authority-amendment-bill-2023/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus: Agriculture**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lok-sabha-passes-amendment-bill-to-decriminalise-offences-in-coastal-aquaculture-business/article67168938.ece#:~:text=The%20Lok%20Sabha%20on%20August,country%20will%20welcome%20the%20bill.)

 **Context:** The Lok Sabha has passed the [Coastal Aquaculture Authority (Amendment) Bill, 2023](https://www.insightsonindia.com/tag/coastal-aquaculture-authority-amendment-bill/), to decriminalize offences related to coastal aquaculture activities, promoting ease of business.

**What is Aquaculture?**

[Aquaculture](https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-geography-2/indian-economic-and-human-geography/animal-husbandry-fisheries-and-aquaculture/aquaculture/) involves **cultivating aquatic organisms such as fish, shellfish, and aquatic plants** under controlled conditions. It is a controlled environment where aquatic organisms are **bred, reared, and harvested** for various purposes, including food production, research, and conservation.

**Fisheries** refer to the activities related to **catching, harvesting, and managing wild fish and other aquatic organisms** from natural water bodies such as oceans, rivers, and lakes. Unlike aquaculture, fisheries rely on capturing organisms **from their natural habitats** rather than cultivating them in controlled environments.

**Need for this bill:**

The bill introduces amendments to the **Coastal Aquaculture Authority (CAA) Act of 2005**. The old rules said that some activities related to aquaculture **didn’t need special permission**. But a recent decision by a [**National Green Tribunal**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/11/29/national-green-tribunal-ngt/) **(in 2022) ruled** that the CAA Act of 2005 no longer **exempted coastal aquaculture** from the CRZ Notifications issued in 2011 and 2019. This ruling highlighted the **need for changes to the CAA Act** to align with the updated CRZ regulations.

**Aim of the Bill:** The bill aims to **expand the scope of coastal aquaculture** while reducing compliance burdens and maintaining environmental protection rules.

**Key provisions of the bill:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Provisions**|**Explanation**|
|**Decriminalization of Offences**|The bill removes the possibility of **jail time for certain offences** in coastal aquaculture and replaces it with fines. Instead of jail time, the bill imposes fines of **up to ₹1 lakh for certain offences**.|
|**Expansion of Scope**|The bill widens **the scope of the Coastal Aquaculture Authority’s** activities and reduces regulatory gaps.|
|The **Coastal Aquaculture Authority’s** procedures will be adjusted to be more responsive to stakeholders’ needs.|
|**Promotion of Environment-friendly Aquaculture**|The bill encourages **newer forms of eco-friendly aquaculture**, like cage culture and seaweed culture.|
|**Quality Assurance and Safe Products**|The bill promotes **safe and high-quality aquaculture** products by preventing harmful substances.|
|**Disease-free Broodstocks and Seeds**|The bill supports the creation **of disease-free and improved aquatic life** for coastal aquaculture.|

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**The quint**](https://www.thequint.com/news/law/rahul-gandhi-defamation-supreme-court-verdict-parliament-seat-analysis-impact#read-more)

 **Context: R**ecently Supreme Court put a **stay order on Rahul Gandhi’s conviction** in a defamation case.

**Background of the Case:** Rahul Gandhi was convicted of criminal defamation for comments made during an election rally. He accused individuals with the surname “Modi” of being involved in financial fraud. A Gujarat BJP leader filed a complaint, leading to his conviction and **disqualification from Parliament.**

**What was the SC verdict?**

- The Supreme Court’s order has **stayed Rahul Gandhi’s conviction**, effectively nullifying his two-year sentence in a defamation case.
- **Disqualification Nullified**: His disqualification from Parliament was a result of the conviction. With the stay granted, there **are no grounds for his disqualification anymore**.

Once the Lok Sabha secretariat formally revokes the disqualification, Rahul can return to Parliament as an MP with his perks.

### [Air pollution linked to rise in antibiotic resistance](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/09/air-pollution-linked-to-rise-in-antibiotic-resistance/)

**Source:** [**The Guardian**](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/aug/07/air-pollution-linked-rise-antibiotic-resistance-imperils-human-health)

**Context**: A global study suggests that [**air pollution**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/environment-pollution-and-control/air-pollution/) **is contributing to a rise in** [**antibiotic resistance**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/12/02/what-is-antibiotic-resistance/)**,** posing a **significant threat to human health worldwide.**

- The analysis shows a consistent **link between increased air pollution and rising antibiotic resistance in every country and continent.**
- **Particulate matter PM2.5 in the air can contain antibiotic-resistant bacteria and genes,** which might be **inhaled by humans, potentially contributing to resistance.**

**Key findings:**

- The study, the first comprehensive global analysis of this connection, **suggests that reducing air pollution could help mitigate antibiotic resistance**.
- The study acknowledges that while air pollution is **recognized as a pathway for disseminating antibiotic resistance, there is limited data on specific routes that antibiotic-resistant genes travel via air pollution.**
- The **research found that antibiotic resistance increases with PM2.5 air pollution, with a 10% rise in pollution associated with a 1.1% increase in resistance**.
- A modelling **scenario suggests that without changes to current air pollution policies, antibiotic resistance could rise by 17% by 2050**, resulting in around 840,000 annual premature deaths attributed to resistance.

 **Context:** Scientists from **IIT-Roorkee and the Geological Survey of India (GSI)** have discovered the **fossil remains of a new dinosaur species** in Jaisalmer, Rajasthan, naming it **‘Tharosaurus indicus’**.

- **This long-necked, plant-eating dinosaur belongs to the dicraeosaurid group**. The name “Tharosaurus indicus” **is derived from the Thar desert, where the fossils were unearthed, and “indicus” denotes its origin in India.**

**Significance:**
