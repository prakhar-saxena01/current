#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: Constitutional provisions**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/as-art-370-hearings-begin-question-of-the-temporary-provision-8873824/#:~:text=Article%20370%20is%20titled%20%E2%80%9CTemporary,State%20of%20Jammu%20and%20Kashmir%E2%80%9D.&text=The%20Supreme%20Court%20on%20Wednesday,status%20to%20Jammu%20and%20Kashmir.)

 **Context:** The Supreme Court began hearings on the **constitutional challenge to the 2019 abrogation of** [**Article 370**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/07/11/article-370-4/), which granted **special status to Jammu and Kashmir**.

**What is** [**Article 370**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/07/11/article-370-4/)**?**

Article 370 was a provision in the Indian Constitution that **granted special autonomy and privileges to the state of Jammu and Kashmir**. It allowed the state to have **its own constitution, flag, and autonomy over most matters** except foreign affairs, defence, and communications. This article was **abrogated in 2019**, revoking the **special status of Jammu and Kashmir** and integrating it fully into the Indian Union.

**Why was Article 370 abrogated in 2019?**

Article 370 was **abrogated in 2019 to fully integrate the state of Jammu and Kashmir into the Indian Union and remove its special autonomy.** The Indian government stated that this move **aimed to promote economic development, better governance, and equal rights for all citizens across the regio**n, while critics expressed concerns about the potential erosion of **cultural and political distinctiveness.**

**The present argument in the Supreme Court regarding Article 370:** 

Article 370 is part of the Constitution’s **“Temporary, Transitional and Special Provisions”** section and is titled “Temporary provisions with respect to the State of Jammu and Kashmir”. The provision outlines that the **President can declare it inoperative**, making it commonly seen as **temporary**. However, the petitioners argue that its **temporary nature is due to the  Jammu and Kashmir Constituent Assembly’s role (1951-1957) in recommending changes to it.** Once the Constituent Assembly ceased to exist in 1957, the provision **was argued to have become a permanent feature**.

The central question that SC will decide is whether **Parliament has the power to abrogate Article 370 after 1957** when the Constituent Assembly was no longer in existence.

**The argument for favour and Against:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Arguments in Favor of Removing Article 370**|**Arguments Against Removing Article 370**|
|**Temporary Provision**: Article 370 is titled “Temporary provisions with respect to the State of Jammu and Kashmir”. This suggests it wasn’t meant to be permanent.|**Original Agreement**: The accession of Jammu & Kashmir to India was based on certain terms, with **Article 370 being central.**|
|**Self-contained Exit**: Article 370(3) allows for the **President to declare the article inoperative**, indicating a mechanism for its removal.|**“Temporary” Misunderstood**: The term “temporary” in Article 370 refers to the period before J&K’s Constituent Assembly created its Constitution (1951-1957), not the Article’s lifespan.|
|**Uniformity**: Removal can lead to the uniform application of Indian laws to Jammu & Kashmir, integrating it fully with India.|**Constituent Assembly’s Role**: Clause (3) of Article 370 mandated that any change to the relationship between J&K and India **needed the J&K Constituent Assembly’s recommendation.**|
|**Development & Growth:** Some believe removal can boost the region’s development, as it would get equal attention and opportunities like other states.|**End of Constituent Assembly:** Since the Constituent Assembly ceased to exist after 1957, the power to alter **Article 370 also ended, making the Article permanent.**|
||**Preservation of Identity**: Article 370 ensured J&K maintained its unique identity and relationship with India.|

**Conclusion:**

 **As the ongoing Supreme Court hearing** unfolds, it’s evident that finding a **balanced resolution** that respects **historical agreements** while considering **contemporary realities** is crucial for the future of the region and the country.

### [“Limited Internet shutdowns” and their impact](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/04/limited-internet-shutdowns-and-their-impact/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: Government policies and interventions**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/apar-gupta-writes-on-manipur-internet-shutdown-is-no-cure-8873758/#:~:text=There%20is%20no%20evidence%20to,the%20harm%20they%20can%20do&text=A%20'limited%20internet%20shutdown'%20on,protest%20and%20demand%20state%20accountability.)

 **Context:** The idea of “limited internet shutdowns” is gaining traction as a way to control riots and security threats while allowing beneficial use of the internet. However, there is **no study by the Indian government or any state government** to assess the effectiveness of these shutdowns.

**What is “Limited internet shutdowns”?**

It refers to the **intentional restriction or blocking of access to the internet,** often specific websites or online services, within a **defined geographic area or for a specified period of time**. This is done as a response to security threats, social unrest, or public emergencies, with the aim of controlling the flow of information and communication.

- g., this has been applied in Manipur violence and recent Nuh (Haryana) communal violence.

**Status of India on Internet shutdown:** 

According to a report by **Access Now and the KeepItOn coalition**, India enforced as many as **84 internet shutdowns in 2022** and was on **top of the list for the fifth year in a row**.

- In 2022, the **Internet was shut down 49 times in Jammu and Kashmir**, the highest of any state in the country.

**Constitutional Articles & Internet Shutdown:**

- **Internet-related rights** are protected by [**Articles 19**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/indian-constitution/significant-provisions/fundamental-rights/fundamental-rights-articles-12-35/rights-to-freedom/)**(1)(a)** (freedom of speech and expression) and **19(1)(g)** (freedom of trade and commerce).
- **Exceptions**: Restrictions on these rights should follow the guidelines of Articles 19(2) and (6) and adhere to the principle of proportionality.
    - **Proportionality Test: It assesses** whether governmental actions justifiably infringe on individual rights.

**Legal ground:**

Internet shutdown orders are regulated by the [**Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/09/30/the-draft-telecommunication-bill-2022/)**,** which fall under the **Indian Telegraph Act, 1885**. These rules allow for the **temporary suspension of telecom services** in a specific area during public emergencies.

- Senior officials from the **Home Ministry at both central and state levels** are authorized to issue shutdown orders.

**SC Judgment & Amendments on Internet Shutdown:**

- [**In Anuradha Bhasin vs Union of India**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/13/anuradha-bhasins-case-internet-shutdown/) **(2020**), SC stated indefinite internet shutdowns are illegal, requiring **necessity and proportionality.**
- **The Union govt amended 2017 Rules in Nov 2020**, capping shutdowns at **15 days**.
- In Dec 2021, the **Standing Committee on Communication and IT** proposed further amendments.
    - The committee suggested a **comprehensive review of Rules**, technology-oriented changes, and uniform guidelines for states/UTs to minimize public disruption.

**Impact of Internet shutdown:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Impact of Internet Shutdowns**|**Examples**|
|**Communication Disruption**|A recently released [**United Nations-backed report (by OHCHR)**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/06/30/un-report-on-internet-shutdown/) has highlighted that **shutting down the internet affects people’s safety & well-being**, hampers information flow and harms the economy|
|Businesses are unable to conduct online transactions, affecting e-commerce and communication with clients.|
|**Information Flow Disruption**|Limited access to news websites, hindering access to timely and accurate information.|
|Inability to access educational resources, affecting students’ learning during shutdowns.|
|**Economic Impact**|Loss of revenue for businesses relying on online operations and services.|
|Impediments to remote work, affecting productivity and economic activity.|
|**Social and Political Impact**|Inability to organize protests or rallies via social media, affecting freedom of expression and assembly.|
|Government control over information flow during sensitive events, limits public awareness.|
|**Human Rights Concerns**|Violation of freedom of speech and expression, undermining democratic values.|
|Infringement on the right to access information crucial for making informed decisions.|
|**Educational Disruption**|Students unable to attend online classes, disrupt education during shutdowns.|
|Lack of access to online educational resources and platforms.|
|**Healthcare and Emergency Impact**|Impaired access to telemedicine services and health information during critical times.|
|Delays in accessing emergency services or assistance due to disrupted communication.|
|**Global Perception**|Negative impact on a country’s image, raising concerns about digital rights and freedom.|
|International criticism for hindering access to information and communication.|

**Addressing internet shutdowns requires a balanced approach that respects security and rights:**

- **Adhere to Legal Standards:** Follow clear legal grounds and constitutional principles of necessity and proportionality.
- **Transparency**: Provide transparent justifications for shutdowns and hold authorities accountable.
- **Limited Measures**: Use specific, time-bound shutdowns; avoid blanket measures.
- **Alternatives**: Consider content removal or service restrictions instead of full shutdowns.
- **Judicial Oversight**: Ensure judicial review, preventing misuse as seen in Anuradha Bhasin case.
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Collaborate with civil society, businesses, and experts for balanced guidelines.
- **Digital Literacy**: Educate citizens about rights, safe practices, and shutdown consequences.

[UN’s OHCHR Recommendations](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/06/30/un-report-on-internet-shutdown/)

- **Stop imposing Internet shutdowns**: It may be the last recourse but should be used rarely for legitimate reasons
- **Legitimate shutdown**: Need to control the spread of hate speech, disinformation or other forms of content deemed illegal or harmful
- **Clear policies:**There should be an unambiguous, publicly available and legitimate policy for any shutdown
- **Internet companies should engage and collaborate**with stakeholders including government and civil society to prevent such disruption

[India’s nuclear doctrine (presented in 1999) since Pokhran-II:](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/12/25th-anniversary-of-pokhran-ii/)

- It highlighted a **credible minimum deterrence (CMD) and a no-first-use (NFU)** policy, while concurrently supporting **non-proliferation and universal disarmament**.
- The sole purpose of India’s nuclear deterrence is **to deter adversaries’ use or threat of use of nuclear weapons.**
- **The policy changed India’s image** and the US (once an adversary of India’s nuclear programme) signed a civil nuclear deal with India in 2008, acknowledging India as a **responsible nuclear player.**

[**India’s Three stages nuclear program**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/science-technology/nuclear-technology/india-three-stage-nuclear-programme/#:~:text=India's%20three%20stage%20nuclear%20power%20programme%3A&text=The%20second%20stage%20would%20initially,by%20weight%20(0.0055%25)%5D.)

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nuclear_1.jpg?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nuclear_1.jpg)

 **Performance of India’s three-stage nuclear power plan:** India’s three-stage nuclear power programme was formulated **by Homi Bhabha** in the 1950s to secure the country’s long-term energy independence, through **the use of uranium and thorium reserves** found in the **monazite** sands of coastal regions of South India.

- **Three-stage nuclear Plan:** The first two stages, natural uranium-fueled heavy water reactors and plutonium-fueled fast breeder reactors, are intended to **generate sufficient fissile material from India’s limited uranium resources** so that all its vast thorium reserves can be fully utilized in the third stage of thermal breeder reactors.

**Performance:**

- First-stage PHWRs, cover around **half the entire existing base** of Indian nuclear power **(4780 MW).**
- As of now, India produces about **6.****7 GW of power** from nuclear fuel from its **22 nuclear power plants**, effectively contributing **1.8 per cent** to the total energy mix.
- While India has **successfully** completed the **first stage of its nuclear fuel program**, the second stage is still in the works and has taken much longer than expected**.**
- The **first 500 MW Pressurized Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) BHAVINI**, being set up in Kalpakkam, Tamil Nadu, is still in the process of being commissioned and has suffered from significant time and cost overruns.
- According to a report by the government large-scale t**horium deployment is only to be expected 3 – 4 decades after the commercial operatio**n of fast breeder reactors. [2040-2070]
    - As there is a long delay before direct thorium utilisation in the three-stage programme, the country is now looking at reactor designs that allow more direct use of thorium in parallel with the sequential three-stage programme**.**

**Nuclear power has empowered India:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Aspect**|**Empowerment through Nuclear Power**|
|**Strategic Autonomy**|Enables independent decision-making in national security matters.|
|**Deterrence Capability**|Provides a credible deterrence against potential adversaries.|

### [Time-of-Day (ToD) tariff](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/04/time-of-day-tod-tariff/)

**Source:** [**BS**](https://www.business-standard.com/opinion/columns/electricity-getting-the-timing-right-123080200950_1.html)

 **Context:** The article discusses India’s new electricity pricing system, Time-of-Day (ToD) tariff, which adjusts prices based on demand, aiming to reduce consumption during peak hours

**What is** [**Time-of-Day (ToD) tariff**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/26/the-electricity-rights-of-consumers-rules/#:~:text=Introduction%20of%20Time%20of%20Day%20(ToD)%20Tariff%3A,solar%20hours%20and%20normal%20hours.)**?**

Time-of-Day (ToD) tariff is an **electricity pricing system that adjusts prices based on demand**, with higher rates during peak hours and lower rates during off-peak hours. The goal is to encourage consumers to use electricity when demand is lower, helping to manage energy consumption and grid load.

 **Status**: This system is being **introduced in India in 2024** for commercial and industrial users and in 2025 for other users. ToD tariffs are already used in many countries, including the US, UK, and Japan. For this system to work, **smart meters are needed to track electricity use every 15 minutes.**

**Limitations of the system:**

- **Increased Complexity:** Billing becomes more intricate as users must monitor usage across different times.
- **Behavioural Changes Needed**: Consumers must adapt routines, like altering vehicle charging or appliance use.
- **Higher Costs at Peaks:** Inflexible users face elevated costs during high-demand hours.
- **Dependence on Smart Meters**: Success relies on ample smart meter deployment; India aims for 250M by 2026.
- **Possible Resistance**: Some users might not adjust their consumption habits.
- **Storage Challenges**: Renewable energy’s storage limitations can hinder constant supply, despite ToD incentives.

**Context**: The government has set a **deadline for pharmaceutical companies** to implement the revised [Good Manufacturing Practices](https://www.who.int/teams/health-product-policy-and-standards/standards-and-specifications/gmp) (GMP) standards, aligned with **World Health Organisation (WHO) standards.**

**What are Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) standards?**

Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) standards are **guidelines and regulations that ensure the quality, safety, and consistency of pharmaceutical products.**

**Status of GMP in India:**

- **GMP system was first incorporated** in India in 1988 in **Schedule M of Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945**. It was revised in **2018**, bringing them on par with WHO standards.
- **Presently, only 2,000 of 10,500 manufacturing units** in the country were found to be compliant with WHO-GMP standards.

**New regulations:**

- **Companies with over Rs 250 crore turnover** must adopt the revised GMP within six months, while smaller enterprises having a turnover of less than 250 crore have a year.

### [Smart Corn GMO](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/04/smart-corn-gmo/)

**Source:** [**LM**](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/genetically-modified-corn-is-welcome-but-won-t-help-much-11690992679562.html)

**Context**: A new genetically modified (GMO) corn called ‘smart corn’ has been developed by Bayer to withstand climate change pressures.

**What is ‘Smart Corn’ GMO?**

Smart Corn [GMO](https://www.insightsonindia.com/science-technology/biotechnology/gm-crops/) is a **genetically modified corn varietal developed by Bayer**. It grows **shorter and sturdier than conventional corn** to withstand **high-wind storms** caused by climate change. This adaptation aims to **reduce damage to crops and address** the challenges posed by climate-related events.

**Benefits:**

- **Increased Resilience**: Shorter, sturdier stalks make the corn more resistant to high-wind storms, reducing crop damage.
- **Addressing Climate Pressures**: Smart corn is designed to adapt to climate change-induced challenges, like extreme weather events.
- **Innovative Solution**: This shows the potential of genetic engineering to create crops that can better withstand climate impacts.

**Limitations:**

- **Partial Solution:** While smart corn can mitigate some effects of climate change, it doesn’t address the root causes of the crisis.
- **Technical Constraints**: Heavy rainfall and other climate-related factors can still impact crop health, regardless of stalk height.
- **Narrow Focus:** Focusing solely on crop adaptations might divert attention from broader efforts like decarbonization and ecosystem preservation.

**Other notable recent climate-adapted crops include:**

- **HB4 wheat**: FDA-approved **drought-tolerant wheat** with a sunflower gene, developed by Bioceres.
- **ZeaKal soybean**: GMO soybean with enhanced photosynthesis (to capture more CO2) by ZeaKal Inc., distributed by Nutrien.

**What is** [**GMO**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/science-technology/biotechnology/gm-crops/)**?**

GMO stands for **Genetically Modified Organism**. It refers to an organism, typically a plant or animal, whose **genetic material has been altered through genetic engineering techniques**. This involves the insertion of genes from one species into the DNA of another to introduce specific traits or characteristics.

**Context**: Experts working on vulture conservation have praised the Indian government’s decision to ban the **manufacture, sale, and distribution of aceclofenac and ketoprofen, which are harmful to vultures**

**What are Aceclofenac and ketoprofen?**

They are **non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs**) used to relieve pain and reduce inflammation in humans and animals. However, these **drugs are harmful to vultures** and other raptor species when they **feed on carcasses** treated with these drugs.

**Actions to protect** [**vultures**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/31/mission-2023-insights-daily-current-affairs-pib-summary-31-january-2023/vultures/)**:**

- **India has banned the use of Aceclofenac and ketoprofen to protect vulture populations** (under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940)
- **The ban on diclofenac for veterinary use was imposed in 2006**.

 India’s vulture population faced a drastic decline in the 1990s due to [diclofenac use in cattle](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/24/drugs-harmful-to-vultures/). Despite the ban, it will take many years before the population is revived. Vultures are slow breeders, and mortality rates could lead to extinction if not controlled.

**About Vultures in India:**

- **Vultures are medium- to large-sized birds of prey**. They are known for **eating carrion**(the bodies of dead animals).
- **India hosts nine vulture species**, including **six residents** (white-rumped vulture, Indian vulture, slender-billed vulture, red-headed vulture, bearded vulture, Egyptian vulture) and **three migratory species** (cinereous vulture, griffon vulture, Himalayan vulture).

**Conservation Initiatives:**

- [National Board for Wildlife](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/02/14/national-board-for-wildlife-nbwl/) (NBWL) has approved **an Action Plan for Vulture Conservation 2020-2025**. Key highlights of the plan include,
- **Vulture Conservation Centre**
- **Vulture Safe zone**
- **Rescue Centres**: Establishment of four rescue centres, in Pinjore (Haryana), Bhopal (Madhya Pradesh), Guwahati (Assam) and Hyderabad (Telangana). There are currently no dedicated rescue centres for treating vultures.
- **Toxic Drugs**: A system to automatically **remove a drug from veterinary use if it is found to be toxic** to vultures with the help of the Drugs Controller General of India.
- **Vultures Census**
- **Database on Threats to Vultures**
