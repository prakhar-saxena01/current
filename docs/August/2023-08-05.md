#### **GS Paper 2**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/money-bills-vs-financial-bills-what-are-the-differences-what-the-court-has-ruled-8875134/)

**Context**: Recently, Minister for Parliamentary Affairs clarified that **The** [**Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Bill**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/08/data-protection-bill-content-concerns/) is a **normal Bill and not a Money Bill**. The article discusses the differences between Money Bills and Financial Bills, along with the court’s view on the issue

[**Money Bills**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/02/18/what-are-money-bills/) **and Financial Bills:**

**Any bill related to revenue or expenditure** is a [**Financial Bill**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/03/24/what-is-finance-bill/#:~:text=In%20the%20case%20of%20a,introduced%20in%20the%20Rajya%20Sabha.).

**A** [**Money Bill**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/02/18/what-are-money-bills/) is a specific **type of Finance Bil**l that deals only with matters specified under **Article 110(1)** and deals with **taxes, borrowing, expenditure, etc**. It can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha and must be certified by the Speaker.

**All Money bills are Financial bills but all Financial bills are not Money bills**

 **Recent controversies:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Controversy**|**Details**|
|**2017 Finance Act Amendments**|The Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court **struck down amendments made to the 2017 Finance Act,** which was passed as a Money Bill. The amendments altered the functioning of **various tribunals.**|
|**Question of Money Bill Classification**|The Supreme Court referred the matter of whether the **2017 Finance Act amendments could have been passed as a Money Bill** to a **seven-judge bench**, indicating uncertainty about their classification.|
|**Doubts on** [**Aadhaar Act Ruling**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Supreme-Courts-Aadhaar-verdict.pdf)|The Supreme Court has expressed doubts about the **correctness of the 2018** verdict that upheld the Aadhaar Act as a Money Bill.|

**Preconditions for a** [**Financial Bill**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/03/24/what-is-finance-bill/#:~:text=In%20the%20case%20of%20a,introduced%20in%20the%20Rajya%20Sabha.) **to become a money bill**

- **Introduction**: Must be introduced only in the Lok Sabha and not in the Rajya Sabha, as per Article 117(1) of the Constitution.
- **President’s Recommendation**: Can only be introduced on the President’s recommendation, as per Article 117(1) of the Constitution.

**Financial Bills (I) VS Financial Bills (II) :**

 **Financial Bill (I) encompasses matters both related to money bills and general legislation**.

- It is presented under **Article 117 (1) of the Constitution**
- **Similarities** with money bills: It **can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha and upon the President’s recommendation**.
- **Dissimilarities**: Unlike money bills, a Financial Bill (I) can be subject to amendments or rejection by the Rajya Sabha. In case of disagreement between the two Houses, a **joint sitting** can be convened by the President to resolve the deadlock.

**Financial Bill (II)** concerns provisions **involving expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India** but **does not cover the subjects** outlined in Article 110.

- Governed by Article 117 (3) of the Constitution, Financial Bill (II) follows the legislative procedure of **ordinary bills**.
- It can be **introduced in either House of Parliament**, and while the President’s recommendation is **not necessary for introduction**, it becomes crucial during the consideration stage.
- Without the President’s recommendation, neither House can pass the bill.

# Restrictions on the import of electronic devices

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/india-restricts-import-laptop-tablets-and-computers-8874367/)

 **Context:** The Indian government has introduced **immediate restrictions on the imports of personal computers, laptops, and other electronic devices** to promote domestic manufacturing.

**Why restriction?**

India is obligated to its commitment to **zero-duty imports under** [**WTO’s Information Technology Agreement**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/03/wto-outlawing-indias-tech-tariffs/) **(ITA 1). Due to this, the** government was unable to check the import of electronic goods, thus impacting its domestic manufacturing. Hence it imposed import restriction

**What do the new rules say?**

- **Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) (Ministry of Commerce)** issued a notification saying that any import of laptops, tablets, etc., under [**Harmonized System of Nomenclature**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/04/03/harmonized-system-of-nomenclature-code/) **(HSN) 8471** shall be ‘restricted’ and would be allowed **against a valid license from DGFT** from ‘trusted’ sources.
- **Exemption for imports under Baggage Rules**, R&D, testing, benchmarking, repair, etc.

**Aim**: It will likely aim at **boosting local production** and reducing dependence on imports from China, which accounted for over **75% of India’s laptop and personal computer imports** in the previous fiscal year.

**Significance**:

- The decision aligns with the [**production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/15/production-linked-incentive-pli-schemes/#:~:text=In%20the%20PLI%20Scheme%2C%20companies,and%20boost%20the%20country's%20economy.) **for IT hardware** and seeks to encourage companies to manufacture within India.
- Protection of **Critical Information Infrastructure** and its security concerns.
- Achievement of the **Make-in-India vision**

**Impact**: The restrictions are expected to impact **companies like Apple, Samsung, and Acer, potentially leading to increased local manufacturing** and potentially affecting consumer prices based on how licensing norms are enforced.

**About ITA 1 and HSN:** 

**The Technology Agreement, known as ITA 1,** was established in 1996 with 29 members, including India in 1997. This agreement mandates the **removal of customs duties on specific IT products.**

These products, like laptops and computers, are **identified by codes called HSN codes**, which are part of a **global classification system for taxation**. HSN stands for **Harmonized System of Nomenclature**, and it’s managed by the **World Customs Organization (WCO).**

# Red Sanders

**Context:** Recent amendments by DGFT have established that **Tamil Nadu (TN) can export up to 900 MT of artificially propagated red sanders annua**lly, while wild specimens of red sanders have a **zero export quota**.

- DGFT has issued orders under **Foreign Trade (Development & Regulation) Act, 1992 and the Foreign Trade Policy 2023.**

Foreign trade policy **prohibits the import of red sanders,** but it places restrictions on its **export**. In 2019, DGFT had previously revised its [**export policy to allow the export of red sanders in log form**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/03/04/red-sanders-is-now-free-of-export-restrictions/) **and roots**, but only if it originates **exclusively from privately cultivated land, including patta land.**

**About DGFT:**

 **This Directorate (HQ: New Delhi; Ministry of Commerce)** is responsible for formulating and implementing the **Foreign Trade Policy with the main objective of promoting India’s exports.** The DGFT also issues **scrips/authorization to exporters** and monitors their corresponding obligations through a network of 24 regional offices.

**About Red Sanders**

Red sanders, classified as **endangered by the IUCN**, are native to a **specific region within the Eastern Ghats** and are known for their **unique flora**. These trees have a **slow growth rate, taking 25 to 40 years to mature**, and they display remarkable resistance to droughts.

 The Jagannath Temple Management Committee has recommended allowing the **Archaeological Survey of India (ASI)** to inspect the **Ratna Bhandar (treasury) of the 12th century Jagannath Temple in Puri** during the 2024 rath yatra.

This decision holds significance due to pressure on the **Odisha government** to open the treasury, believed to hold **valuable jewellery and stones**.

**The** [**Jagannath Temple in Puri**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/05/20/what-is-the-puri-heritage-corridor-2/) **is located on the eastern coast of Odisha.
