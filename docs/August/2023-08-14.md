### [Bill introduced: Reforms in Indian Criminal Law](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/14/bill-introduced-reforms-in-indian-criminal-law/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus: Governance: Indian Criminal Justice System**

**Source:** [**PIB**](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1947941)

**Context:** Union Home Minister and Minister of Cooperation introduced three bills in the Lok Sabha, namely the **Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita Bill 2023, the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita Bill 2023, and the Bharatiya Sakshya Bill 2023**.

**Aim**: These bills replace the British-era [Indian Penal Code (IPC) 1860](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/10/21/indian-penal-code/), [Criminal Procedure Code](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/03/29/criminal-procedure-identification-bill/#:~:text=It%20authorises%20law%20enforcement%20agencies,and%20investigation%20in%20criminal%20matters.) (CrPC) 1898, and [Indian Evidence Act 1872](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/11/public-interest-immunity-claims/#:~:text=Section%20123%20of%20the%20Indian%20Evidence%20Act%20of%201872%3A%20Under,compelled%20to%20disclose%20such%20documents.).

**Issues with the previous laws:**

- **British Legacy**: The old laws were **remnants of British colonial rule**, designed to maintain their control over India’s justice system.
- **Punitive Approach**: The focus of the old laws was punishment rather than ensuring justice for citizens.
- **Outdated**: The laws, enacted in the 19th century, didn’t align with modern societal norms, technology, or justice requirements.
- **Low Conviction Rates**: The outdated laws contributed to low conviction rates and delayed justice, eroding public trust in the legal system.
- **Gender Insensitivity**: The old laws inadequately addressed crimes against women and children, reflecting an insensitive approach.
- **Complex Procedures**: Cumbersome procedures and paperwork led to delayed trials and inefficiencies in the criminal justice system.
- **Misuse of Powers**: The laws could be misused by authorities to target individuals and curtail civil liberties, such as the misuse of sedition charges.
- **Lack of Victim Focus:** The focus was often on legal technicalities rather than providing support and justice for victims.
- **Lack of Technological Integration**: The old laws lacked provisions for utilizing modern technology, hindering efficient investigation and evidence presentation.
- **Limited Scope**: The laws failed to address contemporary issues like cybercrimes, terrorism, and organized crime adequately.

**Major provisions of the three new bills:**

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|**Provisions**|**Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita Bill 2023**|**Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita Bill 2023**|**Bharatiya Sakshya Bill 2023**|

**Significance**: The new laws aim to expedite justice delivery while protecting citizens’ rights and addressing modern challenges. They emphasize accountability, digitization, and justice rather than mere punishment. In May 2020, **an** [**Expert Committee led by Ranbir Singh**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/03/24/criminal-justice-reforms-3/) was established to propose reforms in the realm of criminal law.

### [A Shift in India’s Democratic Landscape](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/14/a-shift-in-indias-democratic-landscape/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: Governance**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/suhas-palshikar-writes-rise-bulldozer-governance-8887752/#:~:text=The%20reduced%20recourse%20to%20parliamentary,practised%20more%20and%20more%20frequently.)

 **Context:** As per the author Suhas Palshikar, “In recent times, India is witnessing **a transformation from an imperfect democratic system to an unusual sense of democracy** that discards democratic norms”.

**A shift in India’s governance:**

- **Use of forceful measures to restore order**: The use of demolitions and physical coercion to maintain law and order marks this shift. E.g., the use of Bulldozers to demolish houses of those involved in riots, or other heinous crimes
- **State Practices:** State governments are increasingly resorting to demolitions as a means of governance, disregarding **due process and accountability**.
- **State Monitoring**: Governments use surveillance techniques, including drones and facial recognition, to monitor citizens.
- **Citizen Acceptance**: E.g., the use of terms like “bulldozer baba” by leaders to resort to tough stances, endorsing instant justice.

**Issues with the new type of instant justice Governance:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Issues**|**Examples**|
|**Selective Targeting**|In the Haryana demolition drive, only homes belonging to a specific section of the population were singled out for demolition.|
|[**Rule of Law**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/25/rule-of-law/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CRule%20of%20Law%E2%80%9D%20ensures%20that,not%20be%20just%20or%20fair.&text=Bachhan%20Singh%20v.) **Violation**|The principle of the rule of law, ensuring legal equality and equal protection, is disregarded.|
|**Absence of Accountability**|This type of governance reflects **cynicism about accountability, assuming that the ruler’s authority** is benevolent and above scrutiny.|
|**Lack of Judicial Scrutiny**|The **Supreme Court’s lukewarm response** to demolitions in Uttar Pradesh raised concerns about its role in questioning executive actions.|
|**Procedural Erosion**|Legislative techniques such as **reducing recourse to parliamentary committees and rushing bills demonstrate** an erosion of procedural safeguards.|

**Ethical issues concerned:**

 The ethical issue with this type of governance lies in its **disregard for democratic principles, accountability, and the rule of law**. This approach to governance involves using **coercive measures** and **unchecked executive power** to swiftly implement decisions, often targeting specific groups or communities. This raises concerns about **fairness, justice**, and the potential for abuse of power. The **lack of transparency, accountability**, and respect for individual rights undermines the ethical foundation of democratic governance, leading to potential violations of human rights and the erosion of democratic norms.

### [Teaching in the mother tongue](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/14/teaching-in-the-mother-tongue/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: Polity, Social Justice – Education**

**Source:** [**TOI**](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/their-bhasha-their-future/articleshow/102616083.cms?from=mdr)

 **Context:** The article underscores **the significance of teaching children in their mother tongue for better comprehension, enhanced learning, and cultural preservation**.

**Historical Efforts:**

- Mahatma Gandhi believed that **English as a primary medium created a divide between elites and the masses, hindering knowledge dissemination.**
- Leaders like C **Rajagopalachari, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, and Annie Besant stressed an Indian-controlled education system** that values the country’s ethos.

**Government Efforts:**

- The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) issued a directive, **emphasizing the use of the** [**mother tongue**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/11/23/mission-2022-mindmap-importance-of-mother-tongue-in-education/importance-of-mother-tongue-in-education/) **for instruction and displaying its commitment to native language education.**
- The [National Education Policy](https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/issues-related-to-education-sector/new-education-policy/) supports the **promotion of mother tongue instruction.**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Constitutional Provisions**|**Description and Impact**|
|**Article 30 (1)**|**Grants linguistic minorities the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice**.|
|**Article 351**|Directs the Union to promote **Hindi as a means of expression across India, potentially overshadowing other languages.**|
|**Article 350 A**|Mandates state to **provide primary education in the mother tongue.**|
|**Article 350 B**|Establishes a **‘Special Officer’ to address matters concerning linguistic minorities and report them to the President.**|
|**Court Definitions**|The Supreme Court **defined a linguistic minority as a community with a spoken language, regardless of script existence.**|
||It emphasized that **linguistic minority status should be determined within the context of states, not the entire country.**|

**UNESCO Findings on Mother Tongue Instruction:**

- UNESCO has consistently advocated for mother tongue education **since 1953 through Global Education Monitoring Reports.**
- **At least six years of mother tongue instruction is recommended** to bridge learning gaps for minority language speakers.

**Recommended Actions:**

- Implement the **CBSE’s directive to prioritize mother tongue instruction**.
- Address **challenges in teacher recruitment, curriculum development, and teaching materials** to accommodate linguistic diversity.
- Government schools like **Kendriya Vidyalayas and Navodaya Vidyalayas should lead in implementing mother-tongue instruction.**

### [How climate change is killing languages](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/14/how-climate-change-is-killing-languages/)

#### **Content for Mains Enrichment**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/climate-change/how-climate-change-is-killing-languages-91171#:~:text=They%20can%20be%20lost%20to,cognitive%20capacities%20on%20full%20display.)

Climate change-induced **forced migration is causing language extinction**, particularly in regions rich in languages. Environmental disasters like floods and storms are displacing people, leading to language loss.

[**Migration**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/15/migration-away-from-metros-towards-small-towns/#:~:text=Migration%20can%20be%20either%20voluntary,extreme%20poverty%2C%20or%20conflict%20situations.&text=Push%20factors%20compel%20a%20person,and%20migrate%20to%20another%20place.) for economic benefits also drives language shift, as seen with Indigenous languages in the US and Australia.

**Environmental-driven migration** in vulnerable regions like South Asia endangers languages in Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, Indonesia, India, and the Philippines. Small communities dispersing due to migration hinder traditional preservation methods, accelerating language loss.

 **Usage**: The case study can be used in an Indian Society/ Anthropology / Sociology question paper.

 **Context:** The Ministry of External Affairs has **defended the inclusion of the Sanskrit term “[Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam](https://www.insightsonindia.com/tag/vasudhaiva-kutumbakam/)” (The world is one family)** in the G-20 logo.

- Moreover, India will use the English version of the phrase – **“One Earth, One Family, One Future”** – in summary documents and outcome statements.

**Meaning of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam?**

Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam is the phrase that finds its origin in the **Maha Upanishad**, essentially meaning **“the world is family”.** It emphasizes the **interconnectedness and unity of all people and nations, promoting** a sense of global harmony, cooperation, and shared responsibility for the well-being of the planet and its inhabitants.

**Why has China objected to its use?**

China objected to **non-UN languages like Sanskrit** in G-20 texts. The G-20’s working language is English. Official languages of the UN: **Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, and Spanish**

**Importance of “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” in Indian Foreign Policy:**

 **Context**: An **aromatic rice named “Mushkbudji”** from Kashmir received a [**Geographical Indication (GI) Tag**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/12/29/gi-tag/) **recently.**

- Mushkbudji rice, which was granted the GI tag along with eight other products from Jammu and Kashmir**, is known for its short, bold grains and rich aroma**.

In the past, **the consumption of this aromatic rice was restricted to special events due to its limited availability and high cost**.

The government’s efforts to **revive this rice variety in 2007 after its decline in the 1970s due to blast disease have also contributed to its resurgence**. More farmers are **now drawn to cultivate this unique and fragrant rice variety due to its promising qualities and potential for higher income**.

### [IMF Quota Review](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/14/imf-quota-review/)

#### **Facts For Prelims**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/rbi-governor-shaktikanta-das-calls-for-expeditious-completion-of-imf-quota-review/article67184934.ece)

 **Context:** Reserve Bank **Governor Shaktikanta Das** has called for the **timely completion of the 16th general review of quotas** at the [International Monetary Fund (IMF),](https://www.insightsonindia.com/international-relations/important-international-institutions-agencies-and-further-structure-mandate-etc/imf/#:~:text=IMF%20provides%20%2437%20billion%20in,public%20finances%2C%20among%20other%20areas.&text=The%20International%20Monetary%20Fund%20(IMF)%20has%20made%20an%20allocation%20of,SDR)%2012.57%20billion%20to%20India.) highlighting its potential to enable the **IMF to better support distressed nations**.

**Issues highlighted by RBI:**

- **IMF’s funding conditions** often lead countries in urgent need of funds to seek assistance elsewhere due to **conditions and stigmas** associated with IMF support.
    - Riders like **fiscal austerity, and high interest rates** associated with lending can be counterproductive for target economies
- There is a need for a **larger, stronger and more inclusive IMF capable** of managing country risks
- IMF and World Bank play a crucial role in **addressing global debt vulnerabilities** and need to **do more for countries in debt distress**.

**Suggestions:** 

- RBI suggested that **fewer conditionalities** could be applied to programs for countries with reasonably **resilient macro-fundamentals.**
- **A multilateral debt relief program** providing targeted assistance to **low-income countries** with high debt levels such as Sri Lanka and Pakistan
- **Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)** for countries should **be realistic regarding growth** and **fiscal projections**
- Need to expeditiously complete quota review to enhance the **IMF’s legitimacy and policy influence** in the international monetary system.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Quota Subscription**|Each member contributes a sum known as a **quota subscription upon joining the IMF**. The quota is determined using a formula.|
|**Quota Formula**|The calculation involves a weighted average of **GDP** (50%), **openness** (30%), **economic variability** (15%), and **international reserves** (5%).|
|**GDP Measurement**|GDP is measured using **market exchange rates** (60%) and purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates (40%).|
|[**Special Drawing Rights**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/04/18/special-drawing-rights-sdr/#:~:text=The%20SDR%20is%20an%20international,and%20the%20British%20pound%20sterling.) **(SDRs)**|SDRs are **IMF’s unit of account, not a currency**. Its value is determined by a basket of major currencies: U.S. dollar, Euro, Japanese yen, pound sterling, and Chinese renminbi.|
|**Currency Valuation**|SDR value is calculated **daily based on market exchange rates**. The valuation basket is reviewed and adjusted **every five years**.|
|**Quotas in SDRs**|Quotas expressed in SDRs, representing member countries’ contributions to the IMF.|
|**Claim to Currency**|SDRs represent claims to currency held by IMF members, exchangeable among member countries.|
|**Voting Power**|Voting power is **linked to quotas**; larger quotas mean greater influence in decision-making.|

 **Context**: The [**Soil Health Cards (SHCs) Scheme**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/02/15/soil-health-card-scheme/#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20Soil%20Health,including%20recommendations%20of%20organic%20manures.), initiated in 2014-15, involves **soil sampling, testing, and issuance of soil health cards to assist all farmers in the country**.

- These cards provide **insights into soil nutrient status and recommend appropriate nutrient dosages for enhancing soil fertility and health.**

**New Developments:**

- The **Government of India has introduced technological enhancements to the scheme**. The Soil Health Card portal has been upgraded and integrated with a **Geographic Information System (GIS), allowing test results to be visualized on a map.**
- The **mobile application for the scheme** has been improved, enabling smooth implementation and easy access to soil health cards.
- Notable features include **restricted sample collection regions, automated latitude and longitude selection, and QR code generation for linking samples with test results directly on the portal.**
- The Soil Health Card scheme has been **merged into the** [**Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/08/07/rashtriya-krishi-vikas-yojana-2/#:~:text=The%20main%20objective%20of%20Rashtriya,the%20creation%20of%20agri%2Dinfrastructure.) **(RKVY)** cafeteria scheme as a component **named ‘Soil Health & Fertility’ from 2022-23.**
- Guidelines for **Village Level Soil Testing Labs (VLSTLs)** were issued recently and these labs can be established by **individual entrepreneurs, rural youth, community-based groups like** [**Self Help Groups (SHGs)**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Self-Help-Groups-SHGs.pdf)**, schools, and agricultural universities**.

**Context**: A recent **report focusing on the first phase of the Inclusive Conservation Initiative (ICI)** highlights that although there has been an increase in **funding commitments for Indigenous Peoples and local communities (IP and LC)** to enhance conservation efforts, **the overall funding landscape for them remains largely unchanged.**

- The report, on the **International Day of the World’s Indigenous Peoples**, notes that despite growing evidence of the positive impact of IP and LC involvement in conservation, **donors have allocated less than 1% of climate change mitigation and adaptation funding to them.**

The report highlights that in Latin America**, while national and local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) implement 26% of disbursements, Indigenous Peoples’ organizations are attributed with 41% of the funding,** emphasizing the central role of local efforts in conservation financing.
