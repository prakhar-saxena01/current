### [Flood Plain Zoning](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/29/flood-plain-zoning/)

#### **GS1/GS3 Paper** 

 **Syllabus: Geography/ Disaster Management**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/why-zoning-of-flood-plains-is-important-8913109/)

 **Context**: Reckless [**urbanization**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/issues-related-to-urban-development/urbanization/) **near riverbeds is a key factor in recent floods in Punjab**. Experts from the National Institute of Hydrology emphasize **the need for floodplain zoning plans as a long-term solution to mitigate flood losses**.

**What is Flood Plain Zoning?**

Floodplain zoning is a **land use planning strategy that designates specific areas** along rivers and water bodies for various uses based on their susceptibility to flooding.

**Aim**: The aim of floodplain zoning is to **regulate development in these areas to minimize the potential damage and risks associated** with floods.

**Example of** [**floodplain**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2018/04/10/insights-into-editorial-rivers-floodplains-cities-and-farmers/) **zoning:**

**The areas along the river are divided into different zones based on the likelihood and severity of flooding:**

- **High-Risk Zone (Zone A):** This zone is closest to the **river and has the highest risk of flooding during heavy rain events**.
    - In this zone, **only limited and essential structures are allowed,** such as flood-resistant community centres, parks, and open spaces. Permanent residential or commercial buildings are prohibited to prevent damage and loss of life.
- **Moderate-Risk Zone (Zone B):** This zone is located slightly farther from the river and has a moderate risk of flooding.
    - Here, **some residential and commercial development is allowed**, but structures must adhere to flood-resistant design standards. Building elevations might be required to keep living spaces above potential flood levels.
- **Low-Risk Zone (Zone C):** This zone is situated at a greater distance from the river and has a lower risk of flooding.
    - In this area, most types of **development are permitted, including homes**, businesses, and recreational facilities. However, structures might still need to meet certain flood-resistant criteria to ensure safety.

**Different aspects of Flood Plain Zoning:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Aspects**||
|**Benefit**|Well-maintained flood plains act as **natural defences against flooding** and recharge groundwater levels.|
|Identification of flood plains based on topography helps in **better land use planning.**|
|It not only reduces the **damage caused by floods but also maintains the ecological balance** of the floodplain and helps recharge groundwater levels.|
|Proper zoning can prevent unsuitable constructions and concretization of flood plains.|
|**Challenges**|Lack of zoning leads to encroachment and mismanagement of flood plains.|
|Unsuitable constructions push floods further inland and delay floodwater drainage.|
|Floodplain degradation affects soil fertility and quality.<br><br>**States have shown resistance to implementing floodplain management**, including potential legislation, primarily due to population pressure and the lack of alternative livelihoods.|
|**Current Situation**|Punjab lacks proper floodplain zoning despite NGT directions.|
|**Four states** (Manipur, the erstwhile Jammu & Kashmir, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand) **have adopted floodplain** zoning on paper but implementation is limited.|
|Environmental activists and NGOs in Punjab are advocating for floodplain zoning.|

[**NDMA**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/09/29/national-disaster-management-authority/) **guidelines:**

As per guidelines on floodplain zoning by the National Disaster Management Authority, defence installations, industries, and public utilities like hospitals, electricity installations, water supply, telephone exchanges, aerodromes, railway stations, commercial centres, etc. should be **located such that they are above the levels corresponding to a 100-year frequency or the maximum observed flood levels.**

**NGT direction:**

According to the National Green Tribunal (NGT), there should be **no construction within a 500 m area from the central lining of a river.**

**Model Bill for Flood Plain Zoning:**

The Model Bill for Flood Plain Zoning **outlines provisions for flood zoning authorities, surveys, delineation of flood plain areas, notification of limits,** prohibition of flood plain use, compensation, and crucially, removal of obstructions for unimpeded water flow. It proposes replacing low-lying settlements with parks and playgrounds to reduce the loss of life and property.

**Context:** The **ESA/NASA Solar Orbiter spacecraft** has identified **numerous small jets of material emanating from the Sun’s outer atmosphere**, lasting for 20 to 100 seconds and **expelling plasma at speeds around 100 km/s.**

- These jets, detected by **Solar Orbiter’s Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) instrument**, could **potentially be the source of the solar wind**.
- Composed of charged particles (called picoflare jets), **the solar wind continuously escapes the Sun and affects space dynamics.**

These observations **shed light on how and where the solar wind is generated, a longstanding challenge in solar research**. The jets are associated with **plasma ejections from the solar atmosphere, and their discovery suggests that the solar wind may originate from intermittent**, highly energetic outflows rather than just a steady flow.

 **Why disappearance of sea ice cause catastrophic breeding failure of emperor penguins?**

Emperor penguins’ breeding cycle heavily relies on stable sea ice, where they spend their entire breeding cycle. The sea ice, present from April to December, provides the necessary **platform for their breeding and fledging activities** (the stage in the development of young birds when they acquire the feathers and abilities necessary for flight.).

As a result of the loss of sea ice, the penguin chicks were unable to develop their **waterproof adult wings** and regulate their body temperature. This led to their **vulnerability to drowning or freezing to death.**

While emperor **penguins usually adapt to localized ice loss** by moving to stable sites, the extensive shrinking of sea ice extent makes this strategy unfeasible.

This incident marked the **first recorded instance of widespread breeding failure** of emperor penguins across multiple colonies due to sea ice loss.
