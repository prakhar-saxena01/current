### [ECI: Point of contention between the government and the judiciary](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/30/eci-point-of-contention-between-the-government-and-the-judiciary/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: Election Commission of India**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/the-election-commission-autonomy-in-the-crosshairs/article67249177.ece)

 **Context:** Recently, the government introduced a Bill that seeks **to replace the** [**Chief Justice of India**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/03/25/how-supreme-court-chooses-the-chief-justice-of-india-2/) **with a cabinet minister nominated by the Prime Minister in the committee of selection** for the appointment of the Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners in India.

Previously, The Supreme Court gave a unanimous judgment on March 2 and directed that the [**Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) and Election Commissioners**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/appointment-to-various-constitutional-posts-powers-functions-and-responsibilities-of-various-constitutional-bodies/election-commission/) **(ECs)** should be appointed by the President based on a committee’s advice. This committee would include the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha or the largest Opposition party leader, and the Chief Justice of India (CJI).

**For major provisions of the New Bill and issues with it:** [**Click Here**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/11/centres-bill-on-election-commission-appointments/)

[**The ongoing debate in light of the recent Supreme Court judgement:**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/11/centres-bill-on-election-commission-appointments/)

- **Rationale**: [Article 324(2)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/05/18/article-324/) reads “The appointment of the Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners shall, subject to the provisions of any law made on that behalf by Parliament, be made by the President.”
    - Since there is **no law made by parliament on this issue** as provided in the Constitution, the Court felt the need to step in to fill the “constitutional vacuum.”
- **Government’s position**: The government had argued that in the absence of such a law by parliament, there is no real “**vacuum**” as the President has the constitutional power to decide on the matter and asked the SC to exhibit Judicial restraint.
- **Separation of powers**: The debate has focussed on the **separation of powers** which is a feature of the basic structure of the constitution. The question is whether SC is in line to produce such a pronouncement versus whether a government to be elected can appoint persons governing the process of election.
- **Parliament’s new bill**: The new bill has been the government’s rebuttal to the judiciary.
- **Issues in the bill**: The bill attempts to return to the status quo of government decisions while including only the leader of the opposition (replacing the provision of CJI with the minister as a member).
    - This has been criticised as the government of the day having a greater voice in appointing such an important body.
- **Other subjects of debate**: The SC had left the question of funding the EC, the Permanent secretariat and the need for expenditure to be charged to the Consolidated Fund of India for the government to decide.

**Suggested measures:**

- **Transparency and independence in appointment**: The appointments should be made by a bipartisan committee that includes representatives from various stakeholders.
    - Also, the publishing minutes of the meeting of such a committee is essential.
- **Judicial restraint**: The judiciary must be aware of drawing the line between activism and overreacting to exercise restraint except when a true constitutional or executive vacuum exists.
- **Independence of the commission**: The ECI should be given complete autonomy in the conduct of elections which can be done by creating a dedicated cadre of officers responsible for election duty.
- **Charged** **expenditure and other infrastructure**: The government must act on the nudge of the SC to provide a permanent secretariat and other infrastructure along with funding via charged expenditure to ensure the commission’s independence.

**Committee Recommendations:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Committee/Leader**|**Recommendation**|
|**V.M. Tarkunde Committee (1975)**|Broad-based appointments of ECI members through the collegium process rather than the government’s advice|
|[**Dinesh Goswami Committee**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/tag/dinesh-goswami-committee/) **(1990s)**|A similar suggestion for broader-based appointments through a collegium|
|[**Second Administrative Reforms Commission**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/governance/citizen-charters/recommendations-of-second-arc-report/) **(2009)**|Suggested broader-based appointments of ECI members|
|**B.B. Tandon (2006)**|Proposed a **seven-member committee with PM, CJI, Lok Sabha Speaker, Opposition leaders, Law Minister**, and a judge nominated by CJI|
|**L.K. Advani (2012)**|Suggested a **collegium with PM as chairman, CJI, Minister of Law and Justice, and Leaders of the Opposition as members**|

**Current provisions:**

- **Appointment**: The President appoints the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) and Election Commissioners. The President makes the appointment on the advice of the Union Council of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister.
- **Tenure**: They have a fixed tenure **of six years, or up to the age of 65 years**, whichever is earlier.
- **Service conditions**: They enjoy the same status and receive salary and perks as available to Judges of the Supreme Court (SC) of India.
- **Removal**: The CEC can be removed from office only through a process of removal similar to that of an SC judge by Parliament.
- **Number of commissioners**: As per Article 342(2) the Election Commission shall consist of the CEC and such number of other election commissioners, if any, as the President may from time to time fix.

**Conclusion**:

Free and fair elections are the foundation of any functioning democracy. In this light, it is important to find a way to balance the need for independence, accountability, and transparency, in order to ensure that the ECI remains a truly independent and impartial institution.

### [Suspension of Wrestling Federation of India (WFI)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/30/suspension-of-wrestling-federation-of-india-wfi/)

#### **GS Paper  2**

 **Syllabus: Sports Governance**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/explained-why-was-the-wfi-suspended-by-united-world-wrestling/article67245973.ece#:~:text=and%20fair%20manner.-,United%20World%20Wrestling%20(UWW)%2C%20the%20world%20governing%20body%20for,conducting%20its%20elections%20on%20time.)

**Context**: The United World Wrestling (UWW) has provisionally suspended the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) due to the delay in conducting its elections.

The suspension comes in the wake of allegations of **sexual harassment, intimidation, financial irregularities, and administrative lapses brought forth by prominent** wrestlers against the former WFI president, **Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh**, and others.

- The UWW took this action due to the **absence of an elected president and board,** which goes against **UWW regulations and membership conditions**. The suspension is expected to last for **at least six months**
- The UWW has also considered the **protection of athletes** and the need to restore the federation’s functioning as reasons for the suspension

**Why was the delay caused?**

The WFI announced elections for May 7. However, protesting Wrestlers demanded Brij Bhushan’s arrest and his family’s exclusion from elections. The Ministry of Sports halted polls and asked the Olympic Association to form an ad-hoc committee. However, before the election could take place on the date set by IOA, the High Court of Guwahati and Punjab& Haryana stayed the elections.

**As a result of the suspension:**

- **Indian wrestlers** cannot compete under the **national flag in UWW-sanctioned events**.
- **No national anthem** will be played if an Indian wrestler wins a gold medal in these events.
- **However, Indian Wrestlers are not barred from playing**

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus: Use of e-technology in Agriculture**

**Source:** [**Fortune India**](https://www.fortuneindia.com/macro/g20-to-support-digital-agriculture-ecosystem-amitabh-kant-g20-sherpa/113889#:~:text=G20%20member%20countries%2C%20being%20major,says%20Amitabh%20Kant%2C%20G20%20Sherpa.)

**Context:** During India’s [G20 presidency](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/21/editorial-analysis-a-g20-presidency-to-amplify-south-asias-voice/), **member countries are focusing on transforming their agriculture ecosystems into sustainable and resilient systems**.

This involves developing **an** [**integrated digital agriculture ecosystem**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/tag/india-digital-ecosystem-of-agriculture/) with standards and protocols for data interoperability.

**What is** [**Digital Agriculture**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/agriculture/e-technology-in-the-aid-of-farmers/way-forward-for-digital-agriculture-in-india/)**?**

Digital Agriculture refers to the **use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)** and data ecosystems to provide **timely, targeted information and services** to enhance the profitability, sustainability, and efficiency of farming practices. Examples of digital agriculture include:

### [Meaning of “Global South”](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/30/meaning-of-global-south/)

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**BS**](https://www.business-standard.com/opinion/columns/fallacy-fantasy-global-south-123082501361_1.html)

 **Context:**  The term **“**[**Global South**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/09/sansad-tv-perspective-the-voice-of-global-south/)**” originated in 1969 during the** [**Vietnam**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/20/vietnam/) **War** to critique the **unequal global order created by the dominance of the Northern hemisphere** over the Southern hemisphere.

**What is the Meaning of “Global South” with example?**

The term “Global South” refers to **countries and regions that are economically and socially less developed** in comparison to the **more affluent and developed “Global North**.”

Examples of Global South countries include **India, Brazil, Nigeria, and Indonesia**, which often face economic challenges and are considered to be part of the developing world.

**Issues with this terminology:**

- **Geographically**, the division between **Global North and Global South based on the 30-degree north latitude line is arbitrary** and excludes countries like Australia, New Zealand, and developed countries within the Global South.
- **Economically**, the term is inconsistent as nations like **China**, with high per capita income, are categorized as part of the Global South.
- Issues arise due to key **allies of the Global North situated in the Southern Hemisphere**, which contradicts the categorization.

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/comp.jpg)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/comp.jpg)**

**Evolving meaning of “Global South”:** 

- **New Terminology**: It’s a term some leaders use as an alternative to **“developing world”**
- **Beyond Economics:**While the traditional labels focus on economic indicators, “Global South” emphasizes **cultural and other differences**
    - For example, the “Global South” prioritizes sustainable living, ecological balance, and universal healthcare.
- **Cultural Distinction**: The difference between the Global South and the Global North is more about cultural aspects than just economic or developmental ones.

**Context:** India’s [**Chandrayaan-3 mission’s Pragyan rover**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/24/isro-and-chandrayaan-3-mission/#:~:text=Context%3A%20The%20Chandrayaan%2D3%20mission's,to%20reach%20the%20lunar%20surface.) has confirmed the **existence of sulphur on the moon’s surface near the south pole.**

- This discovery was enabled by the **Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) instrument** onboard the rover, **marking the first in-situ measurements of the lunar surface’s elemental composition in this region.**
- The LIBS technique involves **using intense laser pulses to analyse materials**, **creating hot and localized plasma whose emitted light** is then studied to determine the material’s elemental composition.
- The analysis has also revealed the presence of **elements like aluminium, calcium, iron, chromium, titanium, manganese, silicon, and oxygen on the lunar surface**. T

The Pragyan rover is still **actively searching for the presence of hydrogen**.

**Context:** Primatologists have proposed a solution to **address the division caused by a 1.65-km long railway track** within the **Hollongapar Gibbon Sanctuary in eastern Assam**, dedicated to the **western** [**hoolock gibbon**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2018/05/25/prelims-booster-2018-hoolock-gibbons-and-united-nations-conference-on-trade-and-development-unctad/)**.**

- The sanctuary, **home to about 125 hoolock gibbons**, is facing **habitat fragmentation due to the track’s presence**, which has **separated gibbon populations on either side**.
- To counter this, **scientists from the Wildlife Institute of India (WII)** have **suggested constructing an artificial canopy bridge to enable the gibbons** to move across the **railway line**.
- This would help **maintain genetic diversity and support the survival of the endangered gibbons**, which are **highly sensitive to disruptions in their canopy habitat**.
