### [India’s chip design ecosystem](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/01/indias-chip-design-ecosystem/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Changes in Industrial Policy and Their Effects on Industrial Growth**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/explained-mapping-indias-chip-design-ecosystem/article67136594.ece#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20domestic%20chip,global%20teams%20or%20working%20independently.)

**Context:** As part of the 2nd phase of the design-linked incentive (DLI) scheme for the domestic semiconductor industry, the Indian government is considering a proposal to pick an equity stake in domestic chip design-making companies.

**What is the domestic** [**chip industry**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/02/semiconductor-manufacturing-in-india/) **scenario?**

- **India is an important destination** for global semiconductor companies.
    - **This is primarily because of its highly-skilled talent pool** of semiconductor design engineers, who make up ~20% of the world’s workforce.
- **About 2,000 integrated circuits and chips are designed in India** every year.
- **Global players** operating in R&D in the country include Intel, Micron and Qualcomm, etc.
- **Over 30 semiconductor design startups** have been established in India following the DLI scheme with five already having received government support.

**Initiatives to promote the semiconductor industry in India:**

- [**India Semiconductor Mission**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/29/semiconindia-2023/) **(ISM):** Launched in 2021, it aims to build a vibrant semiconductor and display ecosystem to enable India’s emergence as a global hub for electronics manufacturing and design.
- **About SemiconIndia Programme:**
    - It was approved with a financial outlay of INR 76,000 crore for the development of a sustainable semiconductor and display ecosystem in **2021**.
    - **At the** [**‘Semicon India 2023’**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/29/semiconindia-2023/) **conclave**, the Indian PM made a strong pitch to global investors, saying India will emerge as a global hub of the semiconductor and chip-making industry.
- **Approval has been granted** for the modernisation of the **Semiconductor Complex Limited (SCL)** in Chandigarh to transform it into a brownfield chip manufacturing unit.
- The government has also signed agreements with the **US and Japan for cooperation** on semiconductor development, manufacturing, research, design and talent development.

**What is the DLI scheme?**

- The [DLI scheme](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/01/editorial-analysis-indias-semiconductor-mission-might-need-a-compass/) (launched by MeitY in 2021) aims **to provide financial and infrastructural support** to companies setting up fabs or semiconductor-making plants in India.
- **It will offer fiscal support of up to 50%** (max ₹15 crores per application) of the total cost to eligible participants who can set up these fabs in the country, MeitY said in a statement.
- **It is expected to facilitate the growth of at least 20 such companies** which can achieve a turnover of more than ₹1500 crore in the coming five years and **indigenise innovations**.

**How will equity stake help?**

- **Equity will empower design companies** to sell their chip-designing services more effectively and attract a broader client base in the market.
- It would **prevent companies from selling their majority stake to large global players** to scale up the business.
- The equity infusion would be particularly encouraging for local, small and medium-sized firms that potentially face multiple hurdles to be part of the ecosystem.

**Challenges faced by the semiconductor industry in India:**

- **The sector is capital-intensive.** Therefore, any policy directed towards the semiconductor industry requires a long-term strategy.
- **Returns from the investment are not immediate.** According to the NASSCOM, it takes up to 2-3 years before the first product is out.
- **R&D becomes challenging** as chipsets become smaller and functional requirements change frequently.
- **Supply chain disruptions**, like what happened during the COVID-related lockdowns in China, could dampen potential investor confidence in the sector.
- **India owns a much smaller portion of the intellectual property (IP)** relating to the designs, which are mostly retained by global companies.

**Way ahead:**

- The government must consider **how it plans to link its investments to drive more innovation and employment generation** in the sector.
- **It is essential that value-added activities** (with respect to chip designing) are brought into the country.
- In other words, **moving up in the value chain** and enabling the ecosystem must be one of the imperatives of the government.
- **The government should put in place a robust framework** for target evaluation and governance to mitigate the moral hazard posed by politically driven equity investments.

**Conclusion:** The above moves have the potential to create a state-of-the-art design ecosystem which will serve the national interest and also be a supplier to the rest of the world.

 **Context:** Indian companies will soon be allowed to **directly list their securities on overseas exchanges** in specified jurisdictions.

**What is Listing on Stock Exchange?**

Listing on a [stock exchange](https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-economy-3/indian-financial-system-ii-money-and-capital-market-in-india/stock-exchanges-in-india/) is the process by which a **company’s shares or securities are made available for public trading on the exchange**. It allows investors to buy and sell the company’s stock, providing the company with **access to capital and visibility in the financial markets.**

**Present Status:**

Presently, **Indian companies cannot directly list their securities abroad** without getting themselves **listed in domestic stock exchanges**

- In 2020, the **Centre amended the Companies Act,** allowing the **direct listing of Indian companies** on foreign stock exchanges, but a framework has not been put in place so far.
- Currently, **Indian companies can raise money abroad through** [**American Depository Receipts (ADR) and Global Depository Receipts (GDR)**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-economy-3/indian-financial-system-ii-money-and-capital-market-in-india/capital-market-reforms/) ( ADRs are traded on US stock exchanges while GDRs are traded mostly on European Exchanges and used to raise funds)

**How will Indian Companies get listed on foreign exchanges?** 

The process will involve an **initial listing on the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) in Gandhinagar,** followed by permission to list **in seven or eight specified overseas** jurisdictions.

**Significance:**

It will help expand **capital-access opportunities** for businesses in India and attract more overseas investors, ultimately leading to better valuations for Indian companies.

### [46,000-year-old worms brought back to life from Siberian permafrost](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/01/46000-year-old-worms-brought-back-to-life-from-siberian-permafrost/)

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/46000-year-old-frozen-nematodes-worms-8866215/)

 **Context**: Scientists made a fascinating discovery **in Siberia five years ago** when they found and **reanimated two kinds of frozen microscopic nematodes, or roundworms**.

- A recent study reveals that **these worms are 46,000 years old**, **frozen since the late Pleistocene era**. Furthermore, one of them belongs to an **entirely new species called Panagrolaimus kolymaensis.**
- Animals like **nematodes and tardigrades can survive extreme conditions** through a dormant state known as **“cryptobiosis**.” The researchers tested the hardiness of the ancient worms and found that **they can survive the absence of water and oxygen, extreme temperatures, and even drying.**

**What is cryptobiosis?**

 Cryptobiosis is a state in which an organism exhibits no visible signs of life and its metabolic activity becomes nearly **undetectable or temporarily stops**. During this state, organisms can survive without water, oxygen, or under extreme conditions. As metabolism is a key feature of life, cryptobiosis can be seen as a **temporary “death” of the organism.**

**Significance**:

- This discovery increases the **longest documented cryptobiosis period in nematodes by tens of thousands of years.**
- Understanding how these worms adapted to extreme conditions can provide **insights into habitat change caused by climate change and how species can survive despite changing weather patterns**.
- Additionally, the **study raises questions about evolution and the notion of extinction**, **as these worms have stretched their lifespan by thousands of years**.
- The research could **have practical implications in helping species alive today** and humans adapt to extreme conditions.

### [New blood testing technology called GEMINI](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/01/new-blood-testing-technology-called-gemini/)

 **Context**: Researchers have developed a **new blood testing technology called GEMINI (Genome-wide Mutational Incidence for Non-Invasive Detection of Cancer)** that uses **genome-wide sequencing of single molecules of DNA** combined with machine learning.

- This technology has the **potential to enable earlier detection of lung and other cancers.**

**How it works?**

The GEMINI test **starts by collecting a blood sample from individuals at** [**risk of cancer**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/17/cancer-in-india-a-status-report/). From this sample, **cell-free DNA (cfDNA) shed by tumours is sequenced using cost-efficient whole genome sequencing**. Single molecules **of DNA are analyzed for sequence alterations**, providing mutation profiles across the genome.

A machine learning model then identifies changes in cancer and non-cancer mutation frequencies, **generating a score indicating the likelihood of having cancer.**

 In laboratory tests, the GEMINI test, **when combined with computerized tomography imaging, detected over 90% of lung cancers**, including early-stage diseases. The test also identified altered **mutation profiles in cfDNA from patients with other cancers, such as liver cancer, melanoma, and lymphoma, suggesting broader applications**.

cfDNA stands for “**cell-free DNA.”** It refers to **small fragments of DNA that are released into the bloodstream** or **other bodily fluids when cells in the body die and break down**. These fragments of DNA are not enclosed within cells, hence the term “cell-free.”
