#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: Election process**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/house-panel-recommends-lowering-of-assembly-poll-contesting-age-to-18-8877218/#:~:text=A%20Parliamentary%20panel%20on%20Friday,credibility%20of%20the%20political%20process.)

 **Context:** A Parliamentary panel has suggested lowering the minimum age for contesting in Assembly elections **from 25 years to 18 years**.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Benefits of Lowering Minimum Age**|**Description**|
|**1. Youth Representation**: This allows young individuals to participate actively in the political process and bring fresh perspectives to policy discussions.|In countries like **Canada, where the minimum age for candidacy in federal elections is 18**, young leaders like **Pierre-Luc Dusseault** were elected to the House of Commons at a young age.|
|**2. Enhanced Political Engagement:** Encourages political awareness and involvement among youth, contributing to a more engaged and informed citizenry.|The success of **youth-led movements such as “March for Our Lives”** in the United States demonstrates the political activism and engagement of young people.|
|**3. Diverse Leadership:** Promotes diversity in leadership by allowing representation from different age groups, backgrounds, and experiences.|Young youth leaders will bring new energy and momentum to the parliamentary system.|
|**4. Adaptation to Modern Challenges:** Acknowledges that young candidates may have insights into contemporary issues like technology, climate change, and social justice.|The committee pointed out that surveys show significant political awareness and knowledge among youth globally.|

**Drawbacks of Lowering Minimum Age:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Drawbacks**|**Examples**|
|**1. Lack of Experience**|Young candidates might lack the experience and maturity required for effective decision-making and governance.|
|**2. Limited Understanding**|Young candidates may have a limited understanding of the complexities of governance and public policy.|
|**3. Vulnerability to Influence**|Young candidates might be more susceptible to external influence, as they may have less exposure to political dynamics.|
|**4. Inadequate Preparedness**|Lowering the age might lead to unprepared candidates entering the political arena, resulting in ineffective representation.|

[**Election Commission**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/appointment-to-various-constitutional-posts-powers-functions-and-responsibilities-of-various-constitutional-bodies/election-commission/)**’s view:**

The Election Commission **disagreed with the proposal,** stating that **18-year-olds might lack the necessary experience** and maturity for such responsibilities.

**Other proposals discussed by the committee:**

- **Common** [**Electoral Rolls**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/02/08/common-electoral-roll-and-simultaneous-poll/): The committee discussed the **concept of a common electoral roll for different types of elections** but urged caution, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the **principles of federalism**.
-  Currently, **some states utilize the Election Commission’s electoral rolls**, while others do not
-  Implementing a common electoral roll, as proposed by the **central government and ECI,** is presently **outside the scope of** [**Article 325**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/01/13/rstv-the-big-picture-election-commission-collegium-system-appointments-2/).
 -  The committee expressed concern about the **potential impact of a common roll** on state powers listed under **Chapters IX and IX A of the constitution.**

-  [**Aadhaar and Voter ID linking**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/08/29/the-concerns-around-the-aadhaar-voter-id-linkage/): The committee expressed **concerns about linking the Aadhaar and Voter IDs of non-citizens**, suggesting the establishment of **legal provisions to ensure non-citizens** with Aadhaar are not included on **electoral rolls**.
- [**Remote voting**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/30/remote-voting-for-migrant-workers-the-plan-the-election-commission-of-india-ec-has-outlined/): The committee invited comments from political parties on Election Commission’s proposal for remote voting for internal migrants

**Recommendations by the committee:**

- False declaration during nominations: The panel recommended **increasing the punishment for filing a false affidavit from six months to up to two years**, depending on the severity of the offence.
- **Section 125A of the** [**Representation of People Act of 1951**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/governance/elections-in-india/acts-associated-with-elections-in-india/salient-features-of-the-representation-of-peoples-act-1951/)**,** deals with the penalties for providing false information.

### [Justice Rohini panel’s findings](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/07/justice-rohini-panels-findings/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: Government Policies and Interventions**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/explained-why-are-justice-rohini-panels-findings-important/article67162917.ece#:~:text=With%20the%20Rohini%20Commission's%20findings,historically%20been%20able%20to%20avail)

 **Context:** The Justice G. Rohini-led Commission, **established in 2017** to explore the [**sub-categorization of Other Backward Classes (OBC) groups**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/07/15/commission-to-examine-the-issue-of-sub-categorization/), submitted its report to the President of India on July 31, 2023, after numerous extensions.

**What is the sub-categorization of Other Backward Classes (OBC) groups?**

Sub-categorization of Other Backward Classes (OBC) groups involves **classifying existing OBC caste groups into further categories based on their historical dominance** in availing government benefits meant for OBCs.

- **Aim**: It aims to **ensure a more equitable distribution of benefits among OBC communities** by giving higher shares to **historically marginalized groups** and lesser shares to those that have **traditionally dominated such benefits**.

**Background:**

- [National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC)](http://www.ncbc.nic.in/Home.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f)proposed the sub-categorisation of Other Backward Classes (OBCs) back in 2015.
- In October 2017, former President Ram Nath Kovind, in the exercise of the powers conferred by **Article 340 of the Constitution**, appointed a commission to examine the **issue of sub-categorisation of OBCs,**chaired by retired Justice G. Rohini, to ensure social justice in an efficient manner by prioritising the Extremely Backward Classes (EBCs).

 **What is** [**Article 340**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/tag/article-340/)**?**

- It lays down **conditions for the appointment of a Commission** to investigate the conditions of the backward classes.
- The President **may by order appoint a Commission consisting** of such persons as he thinks fit to investigate the conditions of socially and educationally backward classes within the territory of India.

**Constitutional basis:**

- [**Article 14**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/25/rule-of-law/#:~:text=In%20India%2C%20the%20Rule%20of,must%20strictly%20adhere%20to%20it.&text=All%20individuals%2C%20including%20government%20officials,one%20is%20above%20the%20law.) **of the Constitution guarantees equality before the law**. Measures are required to be taken for the upliftment of unequal to bring them on par with the advanced classes.
- [**Article 16**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/06/17/reservation-is-not-a-fundamental-right-says-supreme-court/) **(4) provides that the State can make any provision** for the reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any backward class of citizens who, in the opinion of the state, are not adequately represented in the services under the State.

**Need for sub-categorization:**

There is a perception that **only a few dominant caste groups among them benefit from the existing 27% reservation** in central government jobs and educational institutions.

- In 2018, an analysis of data from 1.3 lakh central government jobs and OBC admissions to central higher education institutions revealed that **97% of benefits were availed by just 25% of OBC castes**.
- **Approximately 37% (983) of OBC communities** had **no representation** in these opportunities, underscoring the necessity for sub-categorization.

**The mandate of the Commission:**

Commission was tasked with **first examining how much of 27% reservation** (jobs and education) and other government benefits meant for OBCs was dominated by which caste groups.

**Major Findings:**

- **The Dominance of Few Caste Groups**: A small number of caste groups among all OBC groups were found to **dominate the reservation quotas** and other government benefits meant for OBCs.
- **Equitable Redistribution**: The need to ensure a more equitable distribution of benefits among OBC communities was identified, aiming to address the imbalance caused by the dominance of certain groups.
- **Reservation Allocation Formula:** The Commission formulated a formula to **allocate reservation shares based on historical underrepresentation**, with the objective of providing a larger share to historically marginalized groups and reducing the share of dominant groups.
- **Rationalization of Central OBC List**: The Commission suggested corrections and replacements in **spellings within the Central OBC list**, aiming to rectify errors and inaccuracies in the entries.

**Why are the Commission’s findings significant?**

The findings are significant because they provide **exact numbers on OBC communities benefiting from reservations since 1992**.

- **Socio-Economic Data Significance**: The data on socio-economic changes among OBC communities since the i**nception of reservation in 1992 is of great significance** as it reflects the impact of reservation policies on these communities’ development.
- **Electoral Implications**: The distribution of benefits, could have direct implications on the **electoral strategies of political parties**, leading them to reconsider their approach towards **caste-based vote banks.**
- [**Caste census**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/02/17/caste-census-3/): The findings come amid calls **for a caste census and growing interest in caste-based surveys**.

**Conclusion:**

The government intends to hold detailed deliberations with various stakeholders before implementing the recommendations to address concerns and ensure smooth execution.

[](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NRF.png)

**Importance of the Bill:**

- **Stimulate increased industry investment** in research and development (R&D).
- **Foster partnerships** between industry, academia, and government divisions.
- **Advocate research across natural sciences**, humanities, social sciences, and the arts to nurture creativity.

**Issues with the Bill:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Issues**|**Examples**|
|**Corporate Influence**|Private sector funding **(70% allocation**) may prioritize **profit-driven research, hindering societal benefit.**|
|**Centralized Decision-Making**|Lack of **diverse and pluralistic research** approaches due to centralization.|
|**Neglecting State Participation**|**The exclusion of state higher education councils** and state governments may undermine cooperative federalism.|
|**Limited Focus on Public Good**|NRF’s heavy reliance on **corporate funding** may neglect research for **public welfare.**|
|**Inadequate Research Evaluation**|Closed peer reviews without broader public engagement may hinder effective knowledge utilization.|
|**Disconnect from Government Goals**|Lack of alignment with the **government’s 2% GDP target for R&D**, hindering national development.|
|**Uncertain Funding Mechanism**|The private sector’s **notional commitment** to funding lacks transparency and enforceability.|

**Conclusion:**

 For the NRF to achieve its intended impact, a **balanced approach is necessary**. While private sector involvement is crucial, it should be complemented by increased public investment in research and development.

### [Water neutrality in Indian industries](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/07/water-neutrality-in-indian-industries/)

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**NITI Aayog**](https://www.niti.gov.in/sites/default/files/2023-08/Report_on_Water_Neutrality_Framework_WR%26LR_vertical.pdf)

 **Context:** The NITI Aayog, a government think-tank, has introduced **a standard definition and approach for water neutrality** in Indian industries.

**What is Water neutrality?**

Water neutrality is described as **achieving a balance between total freshwater consumption**, including both direct and indirect usage, and **quantifiable water savings** resulting from efficiency strategies.

**Explanation using an example:** 

For instance, if a beverage company saves as much water through efficient production as it uses for making beverages and producing materials, it achieves water neutrality. If it saves more, it becomes water-positive; if it uses more, it’s not water-neutral.

**Steps to achieve water neutrality:**

- Reduce water use by **increasing water efficiency**.
- **Install water reuse systems** such as rainwater harvesting or greywater recycling.
- **Offset remaining water demand** in the local region.

**Significance:**

- This concept aims to **save water, enhance its efficient utilization**, and enable the validation of **water neutrality claims** by industries.
- The [NITI Aayog’s](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/functions-and-responsibilities-of-the-union-and-the-states-issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure-devolution-of-powers-and-finances-up-to-local-levels-and-challenges-therein/issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure/niti-aayog/) report estimates that **following water neutrality standards could save 38.23 billion cubic meters of water over the next decade**.
- National Water Mission’s Goal 4 (Increasing water use efficiency **by 20%)** includes the promotion of water-neutral and water-positive technologies.
- The Aayog emphasizes that **water neutrality/positive impact assessments** should consider both resource availability and quality, ensuring any remaining impacts are offset through sustainable water practices.

**Source:** [**LiveScience**](https://www.livescience.com/physics-mathematics/gravity/rare-einstein-cross-warps-light-from-one-of-the-universes-brightest-objects-in-this-stunning-image)

**Context:** Astronomers have discovered a rare example of an **“Einstein cross,” a phenomenon predicted by Albert Einstein in 1915**.

- In this case, a **foreground elliptical galaxy**, located around **6 billion light-years from Earth, has distorted and split a beam of light from a background galaxy about 11 billion light-years away**.
- The result is a **pattern of four blue smudges** around the **orange glow of the foreground galaxy**.
- The background light likely **originates from a quasar**, **a young galaxy with a supermassive black hole at its core emitting intense radiation**.
