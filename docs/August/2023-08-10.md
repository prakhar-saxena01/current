### [81st Anniversary of ‘Quit India Movement’](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/10/81st-anniversary-of-quit-india-movement/)

#### **GS Paper 1**

 **Syllabus: Freedom struggle**

**Source:** [**PIB**](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1946992)

**Context**: On the 81st Anniversary of the **historic** [**‘Quit India Movement’**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/modern-indian-history/freedom-to-partition-1939-1947/quit-india-movement/#:~:text=The%20Quit%20India%20Movement%20failed,of%20the%20Indian%20Political%20class.), the Vice-President, PM and Chairman of Rajya Sabha, paid homage to freedom fighters and highlighted the movement’s enduring relevance.

**About Quit India Movement (also known as the August Movement)**

It was a movement launched at the Bombay session of the All India Congress Committee by Mohandas Gandhi on 8th August 1942, during World War II, demanding an end to British rule in India.

**Reasons that led to the Quit India movement:**

- The Failure of the [**Cripps Mission**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/modern-indian-history/freedom-to-partition-1939-1947/cripps-mission-1942/)
- **Wartime miseries:** There was popular discontent because of rising prices and shortage of rice, salt, etc.,
- **Weakening Empire**: News of reverses suffered by the British in Southeast Asia and an imminent British collapse. It also shattered the **notion of White prestige**

**QIM united people against British Rule:**

- **People’s movement**: By August 9, Gandhi and all other senior Congress leaders had been jailed. With no one to give directions, people took the movement into their own hands.
- **Public rampage**: Many felt Gandhi’s mantra of **Do or Die** represented the militant mood of Gandhi. The general public attacked symbols of authority and hoisted national flags forcibly on public buildings. Satyagrahis offered themselves up to arrest**, bridges were blown up, railway tracks were removed, and telegraph lines were cut.**
- **Parallel governments:** Parallel governments were established in many places:
    - **Ballia** (for a week)—under Chittu Pandey.
    - **Tamluk —Jatiya Sarkar** undertook cyclone relief work, sanctioned grants to schools, supplied paddy from the rich to the poor, **organised Vidyut Vahinis**, etc.
    - **Satara (mid-1943 to 1945**)—named “Prati Sarkar”, was organised under leaders like Y.B. Chavan, Nana Patil, etc. **Village libraries and Nyayadan Mandals were organised,** prohibition campaigns were carried on, and ‘**Gandhi marriages’** were organised.
- **Active help** **by all sections**: was provided. Extended Mass Participation:
    - By **businessmen** through donations, shelter, and material help, **students** (acting as couriers),
    - **Youth, especially the students** of schools and colleges, remained at the forefront.
    - **Women**, especially school and college girls, actively participated and included Aruna Asaf Ali, Sucheta Kripalani, and Usha Mehta.
    - **Workers** went on strikes and faced repression.
    - **Peasants** of all strata were at the heart of the movement. Even some **zamindars participated**. These peasants concentrated their offensive on symbols of authority, and there was a complete **absence of anti-zamindar violence**.
    - **Simple villagers-** by refusing information from the authority.
    - Muslims helped by giving shelter to underground activists. **There were no communal clashes during the movement.**
- **Loyalty to the government** **suffered considerable erosion**: This also showed how deep nationalism had reached.
    - **Government officials including police participated,** passed on secret information to the activists, especially those belonging to lower levels of police and administration, resulting in an **erosion of government loyalty**.
    - **Pilots and train drivers** by delivering bombs and other materials.

Although QIM was **violently suppressed by the British**, it had mobilised the masses with Unparalleled heroism and militancy, which was not seen during the Non-cooperation Movement (1920) and [Civil Disobedience Movement](https://www.insightsonindia.com/modern-indian-history/national-movement-1919-1939/the-non-cooperation-movement-1920-22/#:~:text=Non%20cooperation%20movement%20was%20the,largely%20same%20as%20this%20movement.) (1930).  QIM changed the **character of the Indian freedom** struggle and placed the demand for independence on the immediate agenda of the national movement.

**Quit India Movement’s Enduring Relevance Today:**

For the first time after a long period in our history, **crores of people expressed their desire to be free**…”

**Context**: The “[Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana](https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/welfare-schemes/schemes-under-ministry-of-health-and-family-welfare/ayushman-bharat/)” (AB-PMJAY) has marked **five years of success in providing accessible healthcare** to economically vulnerable populations.

**Features:**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ABPM-Jay-1-1024x878.png)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ABPM-Jay-1.png)

**Impact of the Scheme:**

- **Out of Pocket Expenditure:** It provides support to more than **12 crore families**, aiming to encompass **50% of India’s population**.
    - By doing so, it **reduces out-of-pocket healthcare expenses** and has saved over Rs 1 lakh crore in treatment costs.
- **Gender Equality:** The scheme promotes gender equality, with **48% of treatments benefiting women**, ensuring equitable healthcare access.
- **Universal Health Coverage:** AB-PMJAY aligns with Sustainable Development Goal 3.8 by moving India closer to **universal health coverage**, guaranteeing quality healthcare regardless of economic status.
- **Easy Access:** With over **27,000 hospitals accepting the Ayushman Card** for free treatment, patients can access care in any state with AB-PMJAY, particularly benefiting migrants.
- **Fraud Prevention**: The scheme employs the **National Anti-Fraud Unit (NAFU)** and state-level units, along with [**Aadhaar-based authentication**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/22/aadhaar-authentication/#:~:text=What%20is%20Aadhaar%20Authentication%20(AA,individual%20using%20their%20Aadhaar%20number.), AI, and ML technologies to detect and prevent fraud.
    - It has de-empaneled **over 210 hospitals for violations**.
- **Feedback System:** Patients receive **post-treatment calls** to assess the quality of services, enhancing accountability and service improvement.

**Challenges in implementing the scheme:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Challenges**|**Details**|
|**Cooperation of States**|States’ cooperation is required for harmonizing state health insurance schemes with PMJAY; Some states like West Bengal and Odisha have not implemented PMJAY|
|**Burden of Costs**|Costs disputed between care providers and the Centre; For-profit hospitals find government proposals financially unviable|
|**Inadequate Health Capacities**|Public sector health facilities lack equipment and capacity; Need partnerships with the private sector; Accountability of service providers is crucial|
|**Unnecessary Treatment**|National Health Policy 2017 suggested “strategic purchasing” from secondary and tertiary hospitals; Contracts with providers must ensure adherence to guidelines and treatment protocols to prevent unnecessary treatment|

**Issues identified as per the latest CAG Report:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Audit Findings**|**Details**|
|**Beneficiary Irregularities**|**Over 7 lakh beneficiaries** are linked to a single mobile number in the Beneficiary Identification System (BIS) of the scheme|
|**Household Size Inconsistencies**|Unrealistic family sizes in **43,197 households (11 to 201 members)** indicate validation control issues|
|**Pensioner Inclusion**|Pensioners in states like **Chandigarh, Haryana, etc**. availing PMJAY benefits led to excess payments to insurers|
|**Ineligible Beneficiaries**|Delayed removal of **ineligible beneficiaries** caused improper benefits and extra premium payments|
|**Errors in Beneficiary Identification**|Nearly about **73% of targeted households** are actual beneficiaries|
|**Claims management issues**|**Overlap of beneficiaries with state-sponsored schemes**, excess payments, inadequate validation checks, etc.,|
|**Grievance redressal issues**|**Only about 10% of the complaints** were redressed within the timeframe|

**Improvements:**

- **Communication and Verification**: The National Health Authority (NHA) aims to rectify inconsistencies through **BIS 2.0,** disallowing the use of the same mobile number for multiple families.
- The NHA is also developing a policy to **disable the ‘Add Member’ functionality** in case of any beneficiary family with **more than 15 members**

**Recommendations:** 

- **Implement robust validation checks** to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the provided data
- **Promote the participation of additional private hospitals** in the scheme
- Establish effective **oversight of claim processing and payment**
- **Establish District Implementing Units** for efficient scheme implementation at the local level.

**Conclusion:**

Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) has made **significant strides in expanding healthcare accessibility** and **reducing out-of-pocket expenditure**. Addressing these challenges will be crucial to ensuring the continued success and effectiveness of PMJAY in providing quality healthcare to millions of beneficiaries across India.

### [Keralam](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/10/keralam/)

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/kerala-to-rename-keralam-origin-8884600/#:~:text=The%20resolution%2C%20moved%20by%20Chief,language%20on%20November%201%2C%201956.)

**Context**: The Kerala Assembly has passed a resolution to rename the state as “**Keralam” in both the Constitution and official records**.

While the state has been referred to as “**Kerala” in English**, the name in Malayalam is “**Keralam**.” The resolution aims to **align the English and Malayalam names**.

The term **‘Kerala’** has its **origins in ancient texts**, and **‘Keralam’** is considered a closer reflection of the original Malayalam pronunciation.

**Historical Connections:**

- **Asoka’s Rock Edict**: The earliest historical reference to the region is in Emperor Ashoka’s **Rock Edict II of 257 BC**, where the local ruler is mentioned as “**Keralaputra**,” meaning **“son of Kerala” or “son of Chera,”** referring to the Chera dynasty.
- **Unity of Malayalam-Speaking People**: The demand for a united territory for all Malayalam-speaking communities gained momentum during the **Aikya Kerala movement** in the 1920s. This movement aimed to **integrate the regions of Malabar, Kochi, and Travancore** into a single territory.

**Linguistic Connections:**

- **Origin from ‘Cheram’**: Scholars believe that the term ‘Keralam’ might have originated from the word **‘Cheram’**.
    - Dr Herman Gundert, a German scholar who created the first Malayalam-English dictionary, noted that **‘keram’** is the Kannada form of **‘cheram**.’ He described **‘Keralam’** as **‘Cheram**,’ referring to the region between **Gokarnam and Kanyakumari**.
    - **‘Cheralam’** signifies a region where ‘cher’ means to join, highlighting the unification of diverse areas.
- **Keralam vs. Kerala Pronunciation:** ‘Keralam’ is considered to be a closer phonetic representation of the **original Malayalam pronunciation**. While the English version ‘Kerala’ was adopted for ease of pronunciation and writing, ‘Keralam’ maintains **linguistic authenticity in Malayalam.**

**Significance**: The move to rename the state as ‘Keralam’ aligns more closely with the native pronunciation, historical roots, and cultural identity of the region’s people.

**To** [**rename a state in India**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/07/30/renaming-of-states/#:~:text=A%20bill%20for%20renaming%20a,views%20within%20a%20stipulated%20time.)**, the following process is followed:**

- **State Government Proposal**: The state government drafts a resolution expressing the desire to change the name of the state.
- **Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) Approval:** Since changing the name of a state involves altering the Constitution, approval from the MHA is required.
- **No Objection Certificates (NOCs):** The MHA seeks No Objection Certificates (NOCs) from various central government agencies such as the Ministry of Railways, Intelligence Bureau, Department of Posts, etc.
- **Constitutional Amendment:** If the MHA finds the proposal acceptable and all the necessary NOCs are obtained, a Constitutional amendment is initiated.
- **Bill in Parliament**: The Bill goes through the usual legislative process in both the Lok Sabha (Lower House) and the Rajya Sabha (Upper House). The Bill requires a **simple majority to be passed.**
- **President’s Assent**: Once the President gives his assent, the Bill becomes law.
- **Implementation**: With the President’s assent, the name change becomes official and is implemented.

**Context:** The **Standing Committee on Energy**, through a newly presented report in the Indian Parliament, has requested the **Union Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) to update them on initiatives and outcomes regarding the assessment of** [**tidal**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-geography-2/indian-economic-and-human-geography/energy-resources/non-conventional-resources/ocean-energy/)**, wave, and thermal energy potential in India.**

- The committee discussed and adopted the 20th report **titled “Tidal Power Development in India**“.

The **potential for tidal and wave power in India is estimated to be 12,455 Megawatts (MW) and 41,300 MW**, respectively. However, this **potential is largely theoretical and not necessarily practically exploitable. Ocean thermal energy potential has not been estimated yet.**

**About Tidal Energy**:

- Tidal Energy is a form **of power produced by the natural rise and fall of tides caused by the gravitational interaction between the Earth, the sun, and the moon**.

**Context:** Leaders from **eight Amazonian countries, including Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela**, were **unable to reach an agreement** on the protection of the Amazon rainforest during the Amazon Summit organized by the **Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization (ACTO).**

- The goal proposed by Colombia to **protect 80% of the Amazon from deforestation and degradation by 2025 did not garner unanimous support.**

The leaders focused **on initiating a dialogue about the sustainability of mining and fossil fuel-related activities but failed to commit to stopping oil drilling in the region**.

This lack of consensus has implications for global biodiversity goals, including those set under the Convention on Biological Diversity’s Global Biodiversity Framework in 2022, **where countries agreed to protect 30% of land and sea by 2030.**

**About Belem Declaration:**

The Belem Declaration is a statement released during the **Amazon Summit**, involving leaders from Amazon countries.

- It emphasizes the **importance of Indigenous knowledge** for biodiversity conservation and calls for Indigenous Peoples’ participation in decision-making.
- The declaration promotes **sustainable forest use and diverse economic solutions**, addressing concerns about deforestation and degradation in the Amazon region.
- It also underlines the need to **protect land rights to prevent deforestation** and preserve biodiversity within Indigenous territories.

- The vaquita’s population has dwindled to just **nine or ten individuals due to illegal gill net fishing**, which aims to **catch the totoaba fish for its valuable bladder in the Asian market.**

The IWC’s scientific committee highlighted an **alarming 83% decline in the Vaquita population between 2015 and 2018.** This alert is driven by the need for a new mechanism to voice extinction concerns for various cetacean species and populations.

 **About Vaquita porpoise:**

- The vaquita (Phocoena sinus) is the **world’s smallest cetacean**.
- They are **only distant relatives of dolphins**.
