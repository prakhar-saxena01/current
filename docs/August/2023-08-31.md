### [Fali S Nariman on Basic Structure Doctrine](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/31/fali-s-nariman-on-basic-structure-doctrine/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: Indian Constitution/ Judiciary**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/fali-s-nariman-writes-why-we-need-basic-structure-8915239/)

 **Context:** Fali S. Nariman discusses the significance of the [Basic Structure Doctrine](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/13/basic-structure-doctrine/)

**What is the** [**Basic Structure Doctrine**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/13/basic-structure-doctrine/)**?**

The **doctrine of basic structure** is a **judicial innovation** that puts **a limitation on the amending powers of the Parliament**. The doctrine was propounded by the Supreme Court in [**_Keshavananda Bharati_** **v. _State of Kerala_** (1973)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/26/kesavananda-case-and-its-legacy/) and its objective is to ensure that the **basic features of the Constitution remain unaltered** and to **preserve the core identity** of the Constitution.

**Key Developments of Basic Structure Doctrine:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Year**|**Event**|
|**1965**|German constitutional **expert Dietrich Conrad highlights** the unchangeable nature of fundamental constitutional principles.|
|**1973**|**Kesavananda Bharati case** introduces **basic structure doctrine** in a bench decision of 13 judges.|
|**1975**|**Union of India seeks reconsideration** of the doctrine; a bench of 13 judges convened in November. The bench dissolved without decision, indicating **continued adherence to the doctrine.**|
|**1975**|Constitution **39th Amendment passed,** including Article 329A(4) **attempting to validate Indira Gandhi’s election.**|
|**1975**|Supreme Court declares **Article 329A(4) unconstitutional and void**, reinforcing the doctrine’s principles.|
|**1978**|**Constitution 44th Amendment Act** abolishes remaining clauses of Article 329A, cementing the doctrine’s foundation.|
|**1980**|**Minerva Mills vs. Union of India case reaffirms** the basic structure doctrine in a Constitution Bench decision of five judges.|
|**2007**|**IR Coelho vs. State of Tamil Nadu** reaffirms the doctrine in a bench decision of nine judges.|

**Why did CJI recently call the Basic Structure Doctrine a “North Star”?**

The [**Chief Justice of India**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/03/25/how-supreme-court-chooses-the-chief-justice-of-india-2/) **D. Y. Chandrachud** called **Basic Structure Doctrine a North Star**. This is because it **guides and gives directions to law-makers, implementers and interpreters**.

- **The doctrine acts as a “North Star” because it provides a fixed reference point** or guiding light for constitutional interpretation.
- It helps **prevent any arbitrary or excessive exercise of power** by the government and ensures that constitutional amendments **do not violate or undermine the essential features of the Constitution**.
- It maintains constitutional supremacy by **preventing lawmakers from undermining the essence o**f the Constitution.
- Limiting the powers of lawmakers **prevents the rise of any authoritarian regime**.
- **The core values and goals** of the Constitution **remain intact.** For instance, secularism was identified as a ‘basic feature’ in _R. Bommai_ v. _State of Karnataka._
- It acts as an **effective system of checks and balances** and avoids any concentration of power in any one organ of the government.
- The doctrine has been **instrumental in safeguarding the fundamental rights** of citizens.
- The Doctrine ensures **consistency and stability in the interpretation** of the Constitution itself.

**Significance of Basic Structure:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Significance**|**Explanation**|
|**Testimony to Constitutionalism**|Prevents damage to the Constitution by ruling the majority’s brute majority.|
|**Safeguarding Indian Democracy**|Limits constituent power to avoid totalitarian regimes.|
|**Preserving Constitution’s Tenets**|Maintains founders’ meticulously framed principles.|
|**Strengthening Democracy**|Ensures independent Judiciary, and separation of powers.|
|**Dynamic and Progressive**|Allows adaptation over time, unlike rigid past judgments.|

**Why is the doctrine criticised?**

- It is not found in the **text of the original Constitution itself** and therefore by inventing this test the judiciary is encroaching on the Parliament’s powers.
- **Senior advocate Raju Ramachandran**: The power of “**unelected judges**” to strike down amendments to the Constitution on the basis of this doctrine is “anti-democratic and counter-majoritarian.”

**Conclusion**

However, despite the criticism, by and large, the Basic Structure Doctrine acts as a guiding star that seeks to maintain the sanctity of the Constitution.

### [Air Pollution Shortens Indian Life](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/31/air-pollution-shortens-indian-life/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus: Environment Conservation: Air pollution**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/air/fine-particulate-air-pollution-shortens-average-indian-s-life-by-5-3-years-university-of-chicago-91439)

**Context:** **The Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) report** by the University of Chicago reveals that fine particulate air pollution (Particulate Matter 2.5) reduces the average Indian’s life expectancy **by 5.3 years.**

- This figure is based on the [World Health Organization’s (WHO)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/08/75-years-of-the-who/) guideline of **5 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m3)**

**Key Findings:**

- [**Particulate pollution**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/environment-pollution-and-control/air-pollution/#:~:text=Particulates%20are%20related%20to%20respiratory,are%20currently%20banned%20from%20use.) **is the primary threat to Indian health**, reducing life expectancy by 5.3 years on average.
- **Cardiovascular diseases** diminish life expectancy by **about 4.5 years,** while malnutrition reduces it by 1.8 years.
- **All 1.3 billion Indians** live in areas exceeding the WHO guideline for annual average particulate pollution.
- **Approximately 67% of the population** lives in regions surpassing India’s own air quality standard of **40 µg/m3**
- **India contributed over 59% of the world’s increase** in pollution from 2013 to 2021.
- The [Northern Plains](https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-geography-2/physical-geography-of-india/northern-plain/#:~:text=The%20great%20plains%20are%20the,the%20east%20to%20the%20west.&text=This%20has%20a%20luxurious%20growth,and%20houses%20a%20varied%20wildlife.) are the most polluted region in India and about 39% of residents may lose eight years of life expectancy compared to WHO guidelines.

**Reasons Behind Spike in Air Pollution in South Asia**

The surge in air pollution in **South Asia stems from rapid industrialization**, economic growth, and population expansion. These factors have led to **increased energy demand** and fossil fuel usage in the region. In India and Pakistan, the vehicle count on roads has **quadrupled since the early 2000s**, while in Bangladesh, it tripled from 2010 to 2020. **Electricity generation from fossil fuels also tripled** between 1998 and 2017 in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan combined. While this elevated energy consumption improved living standards and economies, the resulting rise in particulate pollution has had severe consequences.

**WHO’s New Air Quality Guidelines**

The World Health Organization (WHO) has **introduced updated air quality guidelines in 2021 to safeguard population health** by reducing levels of key air pollutants

**These guidelines offer recommended air quality levels for six pollutants**: particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and carbon monoxide (CO)

|   |
|---|
|**Suggestions to Improve Air Quality and Health**|
|1. Adopt or revise national air quality standards based on the latest WHO guidelines.|
|2. Monitor air quality and identify pollution sources.|
|3. Promote clean household energy for cooking, heating, and lighting.|
|4. Develop safe public transport and pedestrian-friendly networks.|
|5. Enforce stricter vehicle emissions and efficiency standards.|
|6. Invest in energy-efficient housing and power generation.|
|7. Enhance industry and municipal waste management practices.|
|8. Reduce agricultural waste incineration and forest fires.|
|9. Incorporate air pollution in health professional curricula.|
|10. Provide tools for the health sector to address air pollution.|

**About the AQLI report:**

Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) Annual Update 2023 translates particulate pollution into life expectancy impact and was developed by the University of **Chicago’s Energy Policy Institute**.

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/warming-pacific-points-to-rise-in-cyclones-over-india-study/article67245627.ece)

 **Context:** A recent study suggests that a **combination of global warming and the** [**Pacific Decadal Oscillation**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/05/07/pacific-decadal-oscillation/) **(PDO), could lead to an increase in the frequency of tropical** [**cyclones**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/world-geography/physical-geography-of-the-world/climatology/cyclones-and-anticyclones/types-of-cyclones/) **originating near the Equator.**

- The PDO is a **20–30-year cycle that occurs in the Pacific Ocean**, **north of 20°N.**The PDO is a pattern of ocean-atmosphere climate variability. During a **“warm”, or “positive”, phase, the west Pacific becomes cooler and part of the eastern ocean warms. During a “cool”, or “negative”, phase, the opposite pattern occurs.**

Global warming has led to an increase in sea surface temperatures, particularly in the Indian Ocean. Warmer sea surface temperatures have **contributed to the formation and intensification of tropical cyclones in the region.**

**About** [**Pacific Decadal Oscillation**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/05/07/pacific-decadal-oscillation/)**:**

The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) is a **natural climate pattern that affects the temperature** of the **Pacific Ocean and the weather patterns around it**. The PDO shifts **between warm and cool phases, with each phase lasting around 20-30 years**

 The PDO is often quantified by the use of an index**, referred to as the PDO Index**. The PDO Index is calculated by **spatially averaging the monthly sea surface temperature (SST) of the Pacific Ocean north of 20°N**

The PDO has been **linked to slower global warming because cold phases of the PDO increase the mixing of colder, deep ocean waters with warmer surface waters**. This temporarily **reduces the rate of global warming caused by increasing greenhouse gas emissions.**

 The PDO also has impacts on the weather. A **warm phase tends to cause heavy rains in the Eastern Pacific Ocean and droughts in Asia and Australia.** A cold phase tends to cause **droughts in the Eastern Pacific Ocean and floods in Asia and Australia.**

- The court ruled that **advocates can solemnize “self-respect” marriages in their personal capacity as friends or relatives of the couple**. However, advocates should not solemnize these marriages in their professional capacity. The court also ruled that “**self-respect” marriages do not need to be publicly declared or solemnized.**

The **Self-Respect Marriage Law, or Suyamariyathai, was legalized in 1968** by the state of Tamil Nadu. The law allows **two Hindus to marry in the presence of friends or relatives without the need for a Brahmin priest or elaborate rituals**. The law requires **the consent of both parties, who must meet the minimum age requirement for marriage.**

 The Self-Respect Marriage Law is considered an alternative to conventional marriages. It **disregards Brahminical rituals, caste endogamy, religious restrictions, and gender norms.**

**The Self-Respect Movement was a social movement that began in 1925** in Tamil Nadu, India. The movement’s goal was to create a **new society without caste, religion, or god**. The movement’s founder**, E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker**, also known as Periyar, wanted to **reject the Brahmanical religion and culture.**

The Self-Respect Movement was also **called the Dravidian Movement**. The movement demanded equal rights for the **backward castes, with a focus on women’s rights.**

**About Chromosomes:** 

Chromosomes are **thread-like structures that carry genetic information from cell to cell**. They are made **of DNA and proteins**. DNA is the material that **holds genes, which are the building blocks of the human body.**

Humans have **23 pairs of chromosomes**. The first **22 pairs are called autosomes**. These code for **most of the genetic traits in the body**. The **23rd pair are known as the sex chromosomes**. These chromosomes decide if a person will be **born male or female**. **Females have two copies of the X chromosome, while males have one X and one Y chromosome.**

 **Origin of the term:** The term “**funga**” was established **five years ago by mycologists**, mostly from Latin America. It refers to the **kingdom fungi**, which is **one of the six kingdoms of biology.**

**Significance**: The term “fungi” should be **added to discussions of biodiversity** to raise **awareness of the importance of these organisms and conserve them** on equal footing with flora and fauna.

**The six kingdoms of biology are:**

- **Animalia**: Animals – multicellular, eukaryotic organisms that can move.
- **Plantae**: Plants – multicellular, eukaryotic organisms that photosynthesize.
- **Fungi**: Fungi – eukaryotic organisms that absorb nutrients from their surroundings.
