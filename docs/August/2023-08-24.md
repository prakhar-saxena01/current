### [India is becoming a young country but with an ageing workforce](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/24/india-is-becoming-a-young-country-but-with-an-ageing-workforce/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus: Indian Economy, Unemployment**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-cmie-data-a-dissonant-note-8904516/)**,** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/explainspeaking-india-young-workforce-8903202/)

 **Context:** An analysis of [employment](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/27/unemployment-rate-dips-to-4-1-in-21-22/) data from the [**Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/tag/centre-for-monitoring-indian-economy-cmie/) **(CMIE)** reveals that **India’s workforce** has undergone a significant ageing trend over the past seven years.

**Meaning of ‘**[**India’s Workforce**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/11/insufficient-representation-of-women-in-indias-workforce/) **is Aging’**:

An ageing workforce basically means that if one looks at all the employed people in India, the share of young people is going down while the share of those **closer to 60 years of age is going up.**

**Key findings:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Major Findings**|**Details**|
|**Workforce Aging Trend**|India’s workforce has **rapidly aged over the past seven years**|
|**Youth Proportion Decline**|The share of **youth (ages 15 to 29)** in the workforce has decreased from **25% (2016) to 17% (2022)**|
|**Older Age Group Proportion Increase**|The share of those aged 45 and above has grown from **37% to 49%.**|
|**Overall**|The overall count of employed individuals has decreased from **about 41 crore to about 40 crore.**|
|**Employment Rate Decline**|The Employment Rate (ER) for youth dropped from **29% to 19%,** indicating a decline in job opportunities for this age group.|
|**Educational Attainment Impact:**|Youth unemployment **tends to rise with higher educational attainment**, contributing to the overall trend.|
|**Contradiction with Demographic Advantage**|**India’s ageing workforce** contradicts the perception of having a youthful population.|
|**Reason for this trend:**|   |
|**Reasons**|This phenomenon is partially attributed to **rising youth unemployment and a** [**low labor force participation rate,** particularly among **women**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/issues-related-to-women/women-in-workforce/). India’s female labor force participation rate **(32.8%)** is notably low globally.|
|**Skills Deficit**|The ageing workforce **suggests a skills deficit**, highlighting the need to enhance youth employability for a more productive workforce.|

**Implications of these data:** 

**Youth Population Growth ≠ Job Increase**

India’s expanding youth population does **not automatically translate into more job opportunities for them**. Despite the demographic advantage, youth struggle to secure employment and face tough competition from older counterparts.

**Youth** [**Unemployment**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/27/unemployment-rate-dips-to-4-1-in-21-22/)   **Peaks**

Unemployment is most pronounced among the youth, even considering the potential influence of higher education pursuits. This trend warrants attention from policymakers. Even non-CMIE surveys indicate that youth unemployment remains a prominent concern in India.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Recommendations for Policymaker Considerations**|   |
|[**Demography**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/11/22/changes-in-demography/) **≠ Determinism**|India’s demographic advantage requires aligned policies and programs for tangible benefits; demographics alone aren’t sufficient.|
|**Skill Development & Socio-Economic Support**|To avert the negative impact of unskilled youth, prioritize the provision of education, skills, training, and necessary facilities.|
|**Leverage Employability & Well-being**|Unlock demographic dividend by improving the workforce’s employability, health, and education; policies should span land, labour, governance, and vocational training.|

**Conclusion:**

Addressing youth employability is vital alongside the broader goal of creating more job opportunities.

**Definition of Youth:** CMIE’s data defines youth as **individuals aged above 15 and below 25**. However, for the purpose of comparison, the workforce is divided into three groups: 15 to 30 years, 30 to 45 years, and 45 years and older.

**Data on Female Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR):**

As per the latest available Annual PLFS Reports, the estimated Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) on usual status for women of age 15 years and above in the country was 30%, **32.5% and 32.8%** during 2019-20, 2020-21 and 2021-22, respectively, which shows an increasing trend.

### [Can AI be Ethical and Moral?](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/24/can-ai-be-ethical-and-moral/)

#### **GS Paper 4**

 **Syllabus: Applications of Ethics**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/can-ai-be-ethical-and-moral/article67227803.ece#:~:text=No.,%2C%20i.e.%2C%20of%20bounded%20ethicality.)

 **Context:** As AI plays a growing role in decision-making, concerns arise about its ethical implications in governance.

[**Ethics vs. Morality**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/ethics-integrity-and-aptitude/ethics-and-human-interface/ethics-morals-and-values/#:~:text=According%20to%20Charles%20Colson%2C%20%E2%80%9CMorality,are%20typically%20defined%20by%20society.)**:**

**Ethics is a broader and more systematic** study of principles that guide behavior in a given context, while **morality** is the individual’s internalized sense of right and wrong shaped by personal and cultural factors.

**The integration of AI into decision-making raises questions about whether AI can exhibit ethical behaviour and morality**.

[**AI’s Potential for Ethical and Moral Behavior**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/04/generative-ai-what-are-the-potential-applications-and-ethical-concerns/)**:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Aspect**|**AI’s Potential for Ethical and Moral Behavior**|
|**Views**|   |
|**Understanding Ethics and Morality**|For e.g., AI systems can be trained to identify hate speech and offensive content to maintain a respectful online environment.|
|**Bias Mitigation**|AI can be programmed to mitigate biases and avoid unfair discrimination.|
|**Decision-Making**|AI can make ethical decisions based on **predefined rules and data. (but lacks true moral understanding)**|
|**Counterview**|   |
|**Learning from Data**|AI learns from data, which might include biased or unethical information, leading to unintended consequences.|
|**Ethics in AI: Kantian Perspective**|Applying Kantian ethics to AI decision-making within governance raises concerns. Delegating decisions to algorithms could **undermine human moral reasoning and responsibility.** Isaac Asimov’s ‘Three Laws of Robotics’ also highlights the challenges in translating ethics into AI rules.|
|**Programming Ethics into AI: A Complex Task**|**Programming ethical AI** is more challenging than programming AI for tasks like chess due to the intricate nature of ethical considerations.|
|**Autonomy and Intent**|AI lacks consciousness and intent, making its actions neither inherently moral nor immoral. E.g.,  A robot that assists the elderly with daily tasks completes them efficiently but without genuine care or compassion.|
|**Accountability and Liability**|**As AI assumes decision-making roles**, accountability questions arise. If AI-based decisions turn out to be unethical, who bears responsibility? Punishing AI is problematic as it lacks emotions. Deciding who is accountable—AI developer, AI user, or AI itself—poses a significant challenge|
|**Unintended Consequences**|E.g., Social media algorithms, while aiming to show relevant content, might inadvertently create echo chambers and reinforce biases.|
|**Continuous Learning**|AI’s ability to learn and adapt can lead to ethical shifts over time, requiring ongoing evaluation.|
|**Human Oversight**|The ethical behaviour of AI often requires human oversight and intervention. E.g., Content moderation platforms use AI to flag potentially inappropriate content, but human moderators make final decisions.|

**Conclusion:**

Ethics integration into AI is intricate, and its implications must be approached with care. **While AI can contribute to decision-making**, ensuring its ethical behaviour requires addressing complex challenges and considering liability scenarios.

### [Indian Ocean Dipole turns positive](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/24/indian-ocean-dipole-turns-positive/)

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**Business Line**](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/agri-business/indian-ocean-dipole-turns-positive-may-prove-too-late-for-monsoon/article67222902.ece)

 **Context:**  A **report by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology** said that the **IOD index has risen beyond the positive threshold.**

- The IOD refers to **temperature shifts in the Indian Ocean basin**, **impacting monsoons in India**. A **positive IOD event**, characterized by **warmer temperatures in the western basin, can enhance India’s South-West monsoon**.
- However, **the IOD index must remain above the threshold for a sustained period to officially declare a positive event.**
- The positive IOD event tends to [**benefit the Southwest monsoon**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/30/will-the-indian-ocean-dipole-save-the-monsoon/).

**For Australia, a positive IOD event often leads to low rainfall between October and December, delayed monsoon onset**, and reduced tropical cyclone activity.

**About IOD:** 

IOD stands for **the** [**Indian Ocean Dipole**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-geography-2/indian-climate/indian-monsoon/mechanism-of-formation-of-indian-monsoon/recent-concepts/role-of-indian-ocean-dipole-iod/). It refers to a climate phenomenon characterized by the **difference in sea surface temperatures between the western and eastern parts of the Indian Ocean**.

There are **two phases of the Indian Ocean Dipole**:

**Positive IOD**: In this phase, the **western Indian Ocean becomes warmer than the eastern part**. This leads to **increased convection and rainfall in the western Indian Ocean region, including parts of East Africa and the Arabian Peninsula**, while causing drier conditions in the eastern Indian Ocean, including Australia and Indonesia.

**Negative IOD**: In this phase, the **eastern Indian Ocean becomes warmer than the western part**. This leads to **higher rainfall and cooler conditions in the eastern Indian Ocean region,** including Australia and Indonesia, while causing drier conditions in the western Indian Ocean region.

 **Context:** The **western coast of the United States** recently experienced **Hurricane Hilary**, which transformed into a **sub-tropical storm upon reaching the US**.

- This event led to the **National Hurricane Centre (NHC)** issuing its inaugural tropical storm watch for **certain areas of Southern California**.
- California had an **exceptionally wet winter** with multiple [**‘atmospheric river’**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/23/what-californias-atmospheric-rivers-mean-for-drought-floods-fires/) **storms**, and the area also witnessed the intriguing phenomenon of the **‘Fujiwhara effect’ during one of these storms, where two low-pressure areas interacted in an unexpected manner.**

**About The Fujiwhara effect:**

- The “**Fujiwhara effect,” where two** [**cyclones**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/08/cyclones-how-are-cyclones-formed-and-named/#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20cyclone%20and%20how%20are%20they%20formed%3F&text=A%20cyclone%20is%20a%20low,that%20forms%20over%20warm%20waters.&text=A%20high%20temperature%20anywhere%20means,temperature%20means%20high%2Dpressure%20wind.) **(or hurricanes) spinning in the same direction interact in a dance-like manner around a common centre**. If one cyclone is stronger**, it can absorb the weaker one.**
- When of **similar strength, they might merge or rotate around each other**. In some rare instances, the two cyclones **could merge into a mega-cyclone with significant destructive potential.**
- The Fujiwhara effect was **first described by Japanese meteorologist Sakuhei Fujiwhara in 1921**.

 **Context: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)** has **granted approval to Pfizer’s vaccine, Abrysvo, aimed at safeguarding new-borns from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)** by vaccinating pregnant individuals during the **latter stages of pregnancy**.

- Abrysvo has been authorized for use in adults aged 60 and above to protect them from RSV. The vaccine generates **passive immunity by producing antibodies against RSV in pregnant individuals, which are then passed on to their foetuses in the uterus**.

Abrysvo’s approval is based on its **demonstrated effectiveness in reducing the risk of severe lower respiratory tract disease** caused by RSV in new-borns. However, concerns have been raised about potential **preterm births in response to the vaccine, similar to issues seen with another competitor vaccine.**

**About Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection:** 

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is a **common respiratory illness that primarily affects infants, young children, and older adults**. RSV belongs to the family of **viruses called Paramyxoviridae** and is a leading cause **of lower respiratory tract infections, such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia, especially in children under the age of two.**

 The virus spreads through respiratory droplets when an infected person **coughs or sneezes, and it can also be transmitted through direct contact with contaminated surfaces.**
