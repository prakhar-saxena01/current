### [16th Finance Commission](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/16/16th-finance-commission/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Powers, Functions and Responsibilities of various Constitutional Bodies**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/the-next-finance-commission-will-have-a-tough-task/article66969322.ece)

 **Context:** Soon the government will appoint a Finance Commission to determine how much of the Centre’s tax revenue should be given away to States (the vertical share) and how to distribute that among States (the horizontal sharing formula).

**What is the Finance Commission?**

- It is a **constitutional** body constituted **every 5 years** by the **President** of India under **Article 280** of the Indian Constitution **to define the Centre-states financial relations**.
- The First Commission was established in **1951** under **The Finance Commission (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1951**.
- Individual commissions **operate under the** terms of reference **(ToR)** which are different for every commission, and they define the terms of qualification, appointment and disqualification, the term, eligibility and powers of the Finance Commission.
- As per the constitution, the Commission consists of **a chairman and four other members.**

**Each FC is required to make recommendations on:**

- Sharing of central taxes with states,
- Distribution of central grants to states,
- Measures to improve the finances of states to supplement the resources of panchayats and municipalities, and
- Any other matter referred to it.

**Why is there a need for an FC?**

- The Indian federal system allows for the **division of power** including the **taxation powers** between the Centre (collects the majority of the tax revenue) and states (responsible for delivering public goods in their areas).
- Sometimes, this (and also due to vast regional disparities) leads to **states incurring expenditures higher than the revenue** generated by them.
- To address these **imbalances**, the FC recommends the extent of central funds to be shared with states.
- **In the pre-reform period**, the FC recommendations were not that critical because the Centre had other ways to compensate States (such as plan financing).
- **Post-reforms (after 1991),** fresh PSU investments have been reduced and the **Planning Commission was abolished in 2014** making FC the **sole architect/balancing wheel of India’s fiscal federalism.**

**Concerns:** 

**Issues with the horizontal distribution:**

- The ToR of the 15th FC **became quite contentious** because it referred to **the 2011 population figures** in determining the expenditure needs of a State.
- **This was a departure** from the standard practice **to use the 1971 population numbers**.
- States (particularly the southern States) which had done well in stabilising population growth rates, **protested against this change** calling it a ‘**penalty for good performance**’.

**Issues with the revenue deficit grants that the FC awards to States:**

- **The rationale of revenue deficit grants** is that every State should be able to provide a **minimum level of service to its residents**.
- Historically, **FCs have struggled to determine** how much a State’s deficit is due to its fiscal incapacity and how much is due to fiscal irresponsibility.
- They have tried to **tweak the distribution formula** to support deficit States without penalising responsible States.

**Areas on which the 16th FC should concentrate:**

- **Horizontal distribution:**
    - The very nature of the horizontal distribution is that **richer States compensate poorer States**.
    - The challenge of the government before defining the ToR of the 16th FC is to ensure that **this happens without further deepening the divide between States** (North-South).
- **Restraining levying of cesses and surcharges:**
    - Raising taxes is the obvious choice for increasing revenue, but doing so would require the Centre to provide the States 41 paise (for every Rs raised).
    - On the other hand, it gets to retain every rupee if it raises it through a surcharge.
    - **The FC should specify conditions** under which cesses and surcharges may be imposed as well as **a mechanism for capping the amount** that may be raised.
- **Restraint on freebies**
    - In theory, the restraints imposed by the **Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act** should have acted as a check on such populist spending.
    - Governments have, however, devised **innovative methods to increase debt** without it showing up in the budget books.
    - The FC, in the interest of long-term fiscal sustainability, **should lay down guidelines on the spending on freebies.**

### [Strengthening the Integrated Child Development Services scheme](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/16/strengthening-the-integrated-child-development-services-scheme/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: Government policies and programme: Health**

**Context:** The article emphasizes the need to strengthen the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme in India to address issues of malnutrition and health among children.

**Status of malnutrition in India:**

For under 5 years, **stunting** has reduced from **38.4% to 35.5%,** **Wasting** has reduced from **21% to 19.3%** and **Underweight** prevalence has reduced from **35.8% to 32.1% (**As per NFHS-5 (2019-21) vs NFHS-4 (2015-16)**)**

**About ICDS (Integrated Child Development Services):**

|   |   |
|---|---|
||**Description**|
|**About**|The ICDS is a **centrally sponsored scheme** implemented by the Ministry of Women and Child Development. It was launched in 1975, to break the **inter-generational cycle of malnutrition.**|
|**Major Objectives of ICDS**|·        To improve the **nutritional and health status of children aged 0-6 years**<br><br>·        Promote proper **psychological, physical, and social development of the child**<br><br>·        Reduce **mortality, morbidity, malnutrition**, and school dropout rates<br><br>·        **Coordinate policy and implementation** among various departments for child development<br><br>·        **Enhance the capability of mothers** to meet the health and nutritional needs of their children.<br><br>·        **Empower adolescent girls** to become self-reliant and aware citizens|
|**Schemes Under ICDS**|   |
|**Anganwadi Services Scheme**|Provides services for **early childhood care and development**, including supplementary nutrition, preschool education, health check-ups, and referral services.|
|**Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana**|Provides cash **incentives to pregnant women and lactating** mothers during pregnancy and lactation.|
|**National Creche Scheme**|**Offers daycare facilities for children** of working women aged 6 months to 6 years, including nutrition, education, and health services.|
|**Scheme for Adolescent Girls**|Empowers **out-of-school girls through nutrition**, life skills, and education, aiming to improve their social status.|
|**Child Protection Scheme**|Aims to improve the well-being and protection of children in difficult circumstances, reducing vulnerabilities to abuse and exploitation.|
|**POSHAN Abhiyaan**|Targets the reduction of malnutrition and undernutrition in children, with a focus on adolescent girls, pregnant women, and lactating mothers.|
||   |
|**Services provided under ICDS**|·        Supplementary nutrition (SNP).<br><br>·        Non-formal preschool education (PSE).<br><br>·        Immunisation.<br><br>·        Health check-up.<br><br>·        Referral services.<br><br>·        Nutrition and Health Education (NHE)|

**Significance of ICDS**

- Interventions focusing on **nutrition, education, and health** during early childhood, such as ICDS, can significantly **improve human capital, particularly in developing countries**.
- **The ICDS has a positive impact on cognitive achievements**, especially among girls and those from economically disadvantaged families.
- Children who were exposed to ICDS during the first three years of life completed **more grades of schooling than those who were not.**

**Challenges with ICDS:**

- **Overworked**: Anganwadi workers are frequently stretched beyond their limits.
- **Variations**: There is a significant variation in the **implementation of the ICDS** and the level of skills of Anganwadi workers
- **Jurisdictions**: Anganwadi worker recruitment falls under the jurisdiction of State governments. This sometimes creates coordination issues between the centre and the state.
- **Quality of Services:** inadequate infrastructure, lack of trained and motivated personnel, and insufficient availability of essential supplies and equipment.
- **Supplementary Nutrition**: There have been instances of “**nutrition interruption**,” where beneficiaries were not provided with supplementary nutrition for the recommended 300 days a year.
- **Monitoring and Evaluation issues**: E.g., inadequate data collection, limited capacity for data analysis, and a lack of timely feedback and corrective measures.
- **Urban-Rural Disparity:** ICDS implementation faces specific challenges in urban areas, where **population density, migration, and a lack of adequate infrastructure** pose hurdles in reaching and delivering services to vulnerable populations

**Measures to improve ICDS implementation include:**

- empowering Anganwadi workers by increasing their numbers
- providing specialized training
- improving infrastructure and resources
- strengthening monitoring and evaluation systems
- promoting community participation and awareness
- enhancing coordination among departments
- utilizing technology and innovation for efficient program management

**Conclusion:**

Empowering Anganwadi workers in India strengthens ICDS by improving health and education outcomes for children, reducing malnutrition, enabling easy implementation, creating job opportunities for women, and optimizing resource allocation. It is a crucial step in unlocking the full potential of ICDS.

### [Consequences of subsidies](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/16/consequences-of-subsidies/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus:** **Indian Economy and related issues/ Issues related to Direct and Indirect Farm Subsidies**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/world/subsidies-don-t-help-fight-climate-change-world-bank-report-finds-90064)

 **Context:** A new World Bank report highlights the negative consequences of inefficiently subsidising **agriculture, fishing and fossil fuel sectors.**

**Highlights of the report:**

- **Subsidies in the 3 areas** (generally considered to bail out economies in crises) **exceeded $7 trillion**, equivalent to 8% of the global gross domestic product (GDP).
- In 2021, countries shelled out $577 billion to actively lower the price of polluting fuels such as oil, gas, and coal.
- **Agricultural subsidies** (over $1 trillion globally) are targeted at farmers for buying specific inputs or growing particular crops.
    - However, **these subsidies tend to favour wealthier farmers**, even when programs are designed to be targeted to reach the poor.
- **The fisheries sector** receives 35.4 billion per year in subsidies and about $22.2 billion contributes to **overfishing**.

**Negative implications of subsidies:**

- **Exacerbate climate change:** For example, fossil fuel subsidies **incentivise the overuse of fossil fuels** → lead to **air pollution** → **high health burden**.
- Dwindling fish stocks.
- **Inefficient subsidy usage:** It is responsible for ~**17% of all nitrogen pollution in water** in the past 30 years → Health impacts **reducing labour productivity** by up to 3.5%.

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/context.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/context.png)**

**Positive implications** **of reducing subsidies:** _For example,_ a US$0.10 per litre increase in the average annual retail price of diesel may be associated with a decrease of 2.2 μg/m3 in the average annual concentration of PM2.5.

**Challenges:**

- **Demand for energy is less responsive to prices.**
- Cleaner alternatives are not easily accessible and are sometimes not affordable.

**Way ahead:**

- **These subsidies could be repurposed** to finance just transition activities or to provide a better quality of life, as they have far-reaching impacts on the environment.
- **Diverting these subsidies to the financial allotments** made towards commitments made under the 2015 Paris Agreement.
- **Ensuring the availability and affordability of clean technologies**, addressing information and capacity constraints, and addressing behavioural biases are ways to increase the effectiveness of subsidy reform.

**Conclusion:** There is an urgent need to redirect these subsidies to unlock significant funds for sustainable purposes.

### [The Maritime India Vision, 2030](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/16/the-maritime-india-vision-2030/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Infrastructure (Ports)**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/how-india-can-become-a-global-maritime-power-by-2030-8663367/)

 **Context:** The global recognition of the operational efficiencies of Indian ports is an important step in India’s endeavour to become a global maritime power as envisaged in the Maritime India Vision (MIV), 2030.

**Global recognition of the Indian maritime/shipping sector:**

- In the **WB’s Logistic Performance Index (LPI) Report 2023**, India has moved up to 22nd rank in the global rankings on the “**International Shipments**” category from the 44th position in 2014.
- The country has secured 38th rank on the LPI score.

**The reason for the improved performance:**

- **Substantial reduction in the dwell time at Indian ports:** Dwell time (the amount of time vessels spend in port actively loading or unloading cargo) has reached an optimum level of about **3 days only** as compared to 7 in the US and 10 in Germany.
- **Improvement in port operational efficiency:** The country’s average **turnaround time** (TRT) of only 0.9 days is amongst the best in the world (in Germany it is 1.4 days, in the US 1.5 days).

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/major_ports.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/major_ports.png)

**What’s behind improved performance?**

- **Large investments** in the upgradation of infrastructure in the ports and shipping sector in the past few years.
    - As a result, the **capacity at 12 major ports in the country has increased** from 871 million metric tonnes (MMT) in 2015 to 1,617 MMT in 2023.
- **Consistent focus on:**
    - Improvements in port efficiency and productivity through reforms,
    - Induction of new technologies,
    - A greater thrust on public-private partnership (**~150% increase in the value of operationalisation of PPP projects**),
    - An overall commitment to the ease of doing business, and
    - **Decarbonisation** (14-fold increase in the use of renewable energy in major ports) along with the [**Panchamrit commitments**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/08/22/sansad-tv-perspective-indias-climate-targets/).

**Key policy and legislative reforms:**

- **The Harit Sagar Green Port guidelines:** It aims to bring about a paradigm shift towards safe, efficient and sustainable ports while implementing sound environmental practices among all stakeholders.
- **The National Logistics Portal (Marine):** It is a single-window digital platform for all stakeholders including those engaged in cargo services, carrier services, banking and financial services, and government and regulatory agencies.
- **The Sagar Setu app:** Facilitates seamless movement of goods and services in ports while substantially enhancing the ease of doing business.
- **The Major Port Authorities Act, 2021:** It grants greater autonomy to major ports.
- **The Marine Aids to Navigation Act, 2021**: It provides for increased safety and efficiency in vessel traffic services and training and certification at par with international standards.
- **The Indian Vessels Act, 2021:** It brings uniformity in law and standardised provisions across all inland waterways in the country.
- **The Indian Ports Act, 1908:** The government is in the process of replacing this with a piece of legislation that is in tune with present-day requirements.

**What is MIV 2030?**

- **To develop global standard ports in India**, the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways under the MIV 2030 has identified initiatives such as
    - Developing world-class Mega Ports,
    - Transhipment hubs and
    - Infrastructure modernization of ports.
- It estimates the investments to the tune of **1,00,000-1,25,000 crore** for capacity augmentation and development of world-class infrastructure at Indian Ports.

**Context:** The state government of Tamil Nadu has decided to **withdraw the general consent granted to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)** to conduct investigations in the state.

- This move comes shortly after the arrest of Tamil Nadu Minister V Senthil Balaji by the **Enforcement Directorate (ED)** in connection with a job racket scandal.

**What is General consent accorded to the CBI?**

It allows the agency to conduct investigations in a state without seeking fresh permission for each case. It facilitates seamless investigation in cases of corruption or violence involving central government employees in the state.

**More about it:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**About**|**Details**|
|**Legal Basis**|According to **Section 6 of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act** **of** **1946,** the State’s consent is required for the CBI to extend its investigation beyond Union Territories.|
|**Constitutional Basis**|**Entry 80 of the Union List,** allows the **extension of police powers** from one State to another with permission. Also, “**Police**” is listed as Entry 2 in the State List under the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution.|
|**Types of Consent**|**General Consent**: When a state grants general consent to the CBI, the agency can conduct investigations in the state **without seeking fresh permission for each case.**|
|**Specific Consent:** If the **general consent is withdrawn**, the CBI needs to seek case-specific consent from the concerned state government for each investigation.|
|**SC Judgment  (in the** Advance Insurance Co. Ltd case (1970))|The CBI, being a force constituted for **Union Territories under the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act of 1946,** can investigate in the territories of the States **only with their consent.**|
|**High Court power**|The withdrawal does not restrict the power of the jurisdictional High Court to order a CBI investigation.|
|**Impact on Pending Investigation**|The withdrawal of general consent **does not affect pending investigations or cases registered in another State** that involve investigation leading into the territory of the state that withdrew consent.|
|**Other states that have withdrawn the consent**|West Bengal, Rajasthan, Kerala, Mizoram, Punjab, Telangana, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, and Meghalaya|

**Context:** Under the Skill Impact Bond (SIB) initiative, **nearly 18,000 first-time job seekers** have been skilled, with 72% of them being women

**About SIB:**

 The Skill Impact Bond (SIB) is **India’s first development impact bond** for skilling and employment.

- **Launched by** the **National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC)** in collaboration with global partners
- **Aim**: To benefit **50,000 young Indians (over 4 years),** with a focus on empowering women (60% of beneficiaries)
- It is a **public-private partnership (PPP) model** that emphasizes providing employment opportunities to trainees rather than just issuing training certificates.

**Significance:**

The SIB addresses the **impact of the pandemic on women and employment,** removes barriers to women’s workforce retention, and **leverages private sector capital and expertise**. It also works towards **strengthening India’s technical and vocational education ecosystem** through knowledge exchange and mainstreaming good practices.

**What is a Development impact bond?**

A development impact bond is a financial tool that leverages private-sector funding to address social and development challenges.

**Explanation using an example:**

Let’s say the investors **provided $1 million for the education program**. If the program successfully improves literacy rates, the government might repay the investors $1.2 million, including a predetermined return on investment. However, if the program doesn’t achieve the desired outcomes, the investors may receive a **lower repayment or even no repayment at all.**
