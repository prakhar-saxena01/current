### [Groundwater conservation in India](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/06/groundwater-conservation-in-india/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Conservation, environmental pollution and degradation**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/increased-rainfall-alone-will-not-help-groundwater-recovery/article66925433.ece)

**Context:** Since [groundwater](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/04/06/insights-into-editorial-making-groundwater-visible/) consumption and the variability of monsoon rainfall are the two main factors influencing groundwater storage, climate change might pose **new challenges for groundwater sustainability in India.**

**Groundwater:**

- Groundwater is the water that seeps through rocks and soil and is stored **beneath the ground.** **Aquifers** are the rocks in which groundwater is stored.
- **The role of groundwater in human development** becomes bigger in the face of water scarcity affecting about 2.7 billion people around the world.
- **Groundwater management** is imperative to meet the UN-mandated **SDG 6** of providing clean water and sanitation for all.

**Groundwater situation in India:**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/water_fact.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/water_fact.png)

- Groundwater is India’s **most used** water resource, accounting for a quarter of total global groundwater extraction.
- According to the 2021 CAG report, **groundwater extraction in India has exceeded the recharge rate**, threatening 80% of potable water over the next two decades.
- **About 95% of India’s** **groundwater was depleted** between 2002 and 2022, mostly in north India due to increased groundwater pumping **to meet crop irrigation needs.**

**Legal/constitutional/policy framework in India:**

- **The Indian Easement Act, 1882:** Does not establish groundwater ownership and rights clearly.
- **Article 21:** The fundamental right to clean water is recognised under the right to life.
- **Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA):** It is established by the **Environment (Protection) Act, 1986**, to frame groundwater policies and programs.
- **Supreme Court:** ‘**Public trust doctrine**’ – Making groundwater a matter of private ownership would be unfair.
- **Govt schemes:** [Atal Bhujal Yojana](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/29/atal-bhujal-yojana-aby/), Jal Shakti Abhiyan, Aquifer Mapping and Management Programme, etc., are some of the initiatives for groundwater management.

**Challenges:**

- [**Climate change**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/climate-change-and-associated-issues/) (global warming will increase the frequency of hydroclimate extremes – floods and droughts) and **unsustainable groundwater extraction.**
    - **The amount of rain (during the summer monsoon) will rise** as the climate warms.
    - However, groundwater recovery may not be possible due to the expected rise in groundwater extraction for irrigation.
- **A warming climate will increase evapotranspiration –** the process by which water moves from the land surface to the atmosphere via evaporation and transpiration.
- The above factors will **limit water availability for groundwater recovery.**

**Way ahead:**

- Restrict unsustainable groundwater use for irrigation, **cracking down on illegal borewells.**
- Make irrigation more efficient to promote groundwater conservation.
- Groundwater storage variations can be understood by satellite data [say, from NASA’s GRACE satellites] that help conservation efforts be planned appropriately.

### [Higgs boson decay](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/06/higgs-boson-decay/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus****: Science and Technology**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/higgs-boson-z-boson-photon-lhc-standard-model-test/article66933432.ece)

 **Context:** Physicists working with the [**Large Hadron Collider (LHC)**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/13/large-hadron-collider-lhc/) **particle-smasher** at CERN, reported that they had **detected a Higgs boson decaying into a Z boson particle and a photon** which is a very rare decay process.

**About Higgs Boson:**

- The Higgs boson is a **subatomic particle that gives other particles mass**. The strength of a particle’s interaction with the Higgs boson determines its mass.
- **For Example**, Electrons have a certain mass, protons have more, and neutrons have slightly more than protons because of their interactions with the Higgs boson. The **Higgs boson can also interact with other Higgs bosons, indicating its greater mass.**

**Need for understanding Higgs Boson:**

- The properties of the Higgs boson and how particles **interact with it can provide insights into the universe**.

**Z boson and a photon:**

- Virtual particles are particles that **briefly exist and cannot be directly detected but have lingering effects according to quantum field theory**.
- The creation of a Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) involves interactions with virtual particles, resulting in the **production of a Z boson and a photon.** Photons, which are particles of light, **have no mass because they do not interact with the Higgs boson.**

**About the Standard Model of Particle Physics:**

- The Standard Model is a theory in physics that **describes how the smallest particles in the universe behave and interact with each other**.
- According to the Standard Model, there are several types of particles. **There are particles called quarks, which are the building blocks of protons and neutrons, and there are particles called leptons, which include electrons.** These particles have different properties like mass and electric charge.
- The theory explains how these particles **interact with each other through different forces**.
- The **Standard Model predicts the probabilities of different decay paths.** The recent measurement confirms the decay of a Higgs boson into a Z boson and a photon, which was previously observed but now with increased statistical precision.

**Context:** The IRENA released the ‘**Low-cost finance for the energy transition’** report.

**The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA):**

- It is an **intergovernmental** organization (an official UN observer, founded in 2009, HQ – Masdar City, Abu Dhabi) mandated to facilitate cooperation, advance knowledge, and promote the adoption and sustainable use of renewable energy.
- It is the **first international organization** to focus exclusively on renewable energy, addressing needs in both industrialized and developing countries.

**Need for low-cost finance for the energy transition:**

- **The energy transition** is essential to achieve the **5°C climate target** under the Paris Agreement.
- Hence, for a **sustained energy transition**, it is essential to ensure that low-cost finance is available to both emerging markets and advanced economies.

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CO2.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CO2.png)

**Highlights of the report:**

- **Success story:** Renewable power generation technologies, notably **solar photovoltaic and onshore wind power**, have become mature and competitive.
- **Other technologies:** Such as offshore wind, hydrogen electrolysers, energy storage and heat pumps, **need to be deployed at faster speeds, and greater scales**.

**Recommendations:**

- **policies to support industry innovation:** Particularly during the early R&D (in enabling technologies, business models, market design and system operation) to foster commercially mature solutions with reduced costs.
- [**Green hydrogen**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/05/centre-clears-%E2%82%B919744-crore-green-hydrogen-mission/)**:** To enable end-use technologies utilising hydrogen, as well as the expansion of infrastructure to harness this potential.

**Case of India:**

- **The** [**renewable energy**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/10/sansad-tv-future-of-green-energy-in-india/) **sector:**
    - It has seen unprecedented growth driven by **national targets of 175 GW** of renewable energy capacity by **2022** and **500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030**.
    - India ranked third on the Renewable Energy Attractive Index in 2021, and its solar and wind power base is the fourth largest in the world.
- **IREDA’s role in India’s Energy Transition:** The Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Limited (IREDA) was established by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy as **a renewable-energy-focussed non-bank finance corporation in 1987.**
- **India Sovereign Green Bond Issuance:** To mobilize private sector capital for sustainable development and lower the cost of capital for green projects by tapping into new investors.

**Way ahead to ensure low-cost finance for the energy transition:**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/finance.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/finance.png)

- **Blended capital needs to be urgently mobilised:** From the domestic and international capital resources of the private and public sectors.
- **Domestic financial markets are critical:** Since they provide diversified funding sources (corporate bond markets) to avoid currency risk and help mitigate macroeconomic shocks.
- **G20 members have a wealth of experience:** In facilitating access to low-cost finance and can share valuable knowledge on innovative financing solutions to reduce the cost of capital.

**Conclusion:** Low-cost capital for financing energy transition projects could be possible through a deeper public-private collaboration on the journey to a net-zero future.

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Challenges to Internal Security, Basics of Cyber Security**

**Source:** [**DSCI**](https://beta.dsci.in/files/content/knowledge-centre/2023/Bridging-the-Gap-Identifying-Challenges-in-Cybersecurity-Skilling-and-Bridging-the-Divide.pdf)

 **Context:** The DSCI released a study called ‘**Bridging the Gap: Identifying Challenges in Cybersecurity Skilling and Bridging the Divide.’**

**Data Security Council of India (DSCI):**

- It is a **not-for-profit**, industry body on data protection setup by NASSCOM in **2008**.
- It is **committed to making cyberspace safe, secure and trusted** by establishing best practices, standards and initiatives in cyber security and privacy.

[**The cybersecurity landscape in India**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/04/05/cybersecurity-in-india/)**:**

- **Cybersecurity refers** to every aspect of protecting an organisation and its employees and assets against cyber threats.
- India, as a nation undergoing **rapid digitisation** across various sectors, is **not immune to the increasing number and severity of cyber threats**.
- To address these challenges, **stakeholders in the ecosystem have implemented several initiatives** to promote Cybersecurity in the country.
- **These include –**
    - **The** [**Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In)**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/01/cert-in-may-be-exempted-from-rti/), set up by the Government of India, to provide guidance and support in the event of cyber incidents;
    - **Programs like Cyber Shikshaa,** implemented by **Microsoft and DSCI**, to skilled professionals in the Cybersecurity domain and to generate awareness among people.
- Though the cybersecurity industry has gained significant importance and is expected to grow rapidly in India, there is **still a deficit of skilled workforce** to cater to the demands of the sector.

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/imp.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/imp.png)

**About the study:** It aims to

- **Analyse** the demand and supply of skilled cybersecurity professionals in India,
- **Identify** technical and social factors contributing to the shortage of skilled professionals, and
- **Explore** solutions to address these gaps through CSR and a multi-stakeholder approach.

**Findings of the study:**

**The top three** [**attacks**:](https://www.insightsonindia.com/security-issues/cyber-security/various-cyber-threats/)

- That are expected to see substantial rise in the near future are **phishing, smishing, and vishing attacks**, followed by ransomware attacks and zero-day exploits.
- **Phishing scams** trick users into divulging sensitive data, downloading malware, and exposing themselves or their organisations to cybercrime.
- **Smishing** often involves sending bogus text messages – have a sense of urgency and request the recipient click on a link or reply with personal information.
- **Vishing** (voice or VoIP phishing) uses voice and telephony technologies to trick targeted individuals into revealing sensitive data to unauthorised entities.
- **Zero-day attacks** take place when hackers exploit the flaw before developers have a chance to address it.

**Three major trends**: **That will catalyse the demand for Cybersecurity are –**

- Use of **AI, ML and IoT** by hackers resulting in increasing Cybersecurity attacks,
- Growing regulatory liabilities and
- Excessive usage of digital platforms resulting in exchange of large amounts of data.

**Cybersecurity professionals:**

- Cybersecurity Risk Analyst, Cybersecurity Analyst, and Penetration Tester are the most prevalent job roles at present.
- They constitute **less than 5% of their company’s overall workforce.**
- 43% of corporations have **women participation** between 21%-40% of the overall Cybersecurity workforce.

**Recommendations:**

- **Need for organisations to perform risk assessments** at regular intervals and have robust security measures.
- **There is a need for –**
    - **Multi-stakeholder collaboration** to map industry-relevant skills, and design and deliver skilling programs as per industry standards.
    - **Training providers/NGOs** to promote **the inclusion of diverse groups** and formulate strong inclusive programs that can specifically cater for the needs of PwDs.
- **Corporates can play a pivotal role** [through their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)] by incorporating and sponsoring Cybersecurity certification (addressing the certification gaps) as a part of their skilling initiatives.

### [Pet coke](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/06/pet-coke/)

 **Source:** [**Economic Times**](https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/power/govt-permits-import-of-pet-coke-as-raw-material-for-lithium-ion-batteries/100716407)

**Context:** The government permitted the **import of Needle pet coke for making graphite anode material for** [**lithium-ion batteries**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/03/li-ion-battery-recycling-technology/) as a feedstock and **not for any other purposes**.

- Import of pet coke for fuel purposes is completely banned.

However, **the sulphur content in the NPC should be less than 0.8 per cent,** which would be **monitored by state pollution control boards.**

**About Pet Coke:**

Petroleum coke (pet coke) is a **carbon-rich solid material derived from the final cracking process**, a thermo-based chemical engineering process that **splits long-chain hydrocarbons of petroleum into shorter chains.** As the world’s largest consumer of pet coke, **India imports over half its annual petcoke consumption, mainly from the USA.**

**About Needle Pet Coke:**

Needle pet Coke differs from **regular petroleum Coke in its unique physical and chemical properties.** It is called “needle” coke because of its **needle-like structure, which is formed during the refining process.** This structure gives it certain advantageous properties that make it suitable for specific applications.

- One of the primary uses of needle pet coke is in the **production of graphite electrodes used in electric arc furnaces for steelmaking**. The needle-like structure **of NPC provides excellent electrical conductivity and high strength**, making it ideal for manufacturing high-quality electrodes. These electrodes are crucial for the efficient melting and refining of steel.
- Needle pet coke is also used in other applications that require **high-performance carbon materials, such as in the production of lithium-ion batteries, aerospace components, and certain carbon products used in the chemical industry.**

**The harmful effect of Pet Coke:**

Pet coke combustion emits significant amounts of **greenhouse gases and air pollutants**, including sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter. Pet Coke has a high carbon content and a low energy value compared to other fossil fuels.

 **Context**: A recent study by researchers from the **National Institute of Technology Srinagar** has revealed an alarming level of [microplastics](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/04/27/sansad-tv-nature-and-you-plastic-in-blood/) in the Jhelum River in Kashmir, mainly attributed to unscientific municipal solid waste disposal sites.

Microplastics, **measuring less than 5 millimetres**, are particularly problematic as they can be ingested by riverine fauna and marine species, causing **bioaccumulation**.

**About Jhelum River:**

The river originates from **a spring at Verinag.** It initially flows northwards into Wular Lake, and then changes its course southwards. At **Muzaffarabad**, the river takes a sharp hairpin bend, turning southward. It serves as the boundary between India and Pakistan for a distance of 170 km and emerges at the **Potwar Plateau near Mirpur**. Finally, the river joins the Chenab River at **Trimmu**.
