### [Sedition law in India](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/03/sedition-law-in-india/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Functions and Responsibilities of the Union and the States**

**Source:** [**HT**](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/law-commission-recommends-retention-of-sedition-law-in-india-proposes-changes-101685681464225.html) 

**Context:** The Law Commission of India has recommended the retention of the 153-year-old colonial law on sedition in India.

**The Sedition Law in India:** 

**Section 124A of the IPC:**

- It deals with Sedition – a non-bailable offence and was drafted by TB Macaulay and included in the IPC in 1870.
- Whoever (by words/signs/visible representation) brings or attempts to bring into hatred or contempt or excites or attempts to excite disaffection towards the Government established by law in India shall be punished.

**Punishment under Section 124A:** Punishment under the law varies from imprisonment up to three years to a life term and fine.

**Need of Section 124A:**  **To effectively combat** anti-national, secessionist and terrorist elements.

**Criticism of Section 124A:**

- It is designed to **suppress the liberty** of the citizens (Gandhiji).
- It is highly objectionable and the **sooner we get rid of it, the better it is** (Jawaharlal Nehru).
- **Not in tune with the current social milieu**, and was intended for a colonial regime.
- Often misused to muzzle dissent.
- **Low conviction rate.**

**[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/disposal.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/disposal.png)**

**In SC’s view:**

- **In Kedar Nath Singh v State of Bihar (1962),** the top court upheld the validity of Section 124A, but also attempted to restrict the colonial-era law’s scope for misuse.
    - Invoking the sedition clause requires the **existence of a harmful intent to promote violence** and the penal provision **cannot be utilised to restrict free speech.**
- The government **could not put citizens behind bars simply because they chose to disagree** with the state policies.
- Views, which are **dissent and different** from the opinion of the government cannot be termed seditious.

**Steps taken:**

- **In 2022, the SC effectively put on hold** the colonial-era penal provision, and asked the Centre/states to desist from arresting/prosecuting people under the contentious provision.
- The Union government recently informed the top court that the **legislative process of reviewing/reforming the sedition law was in the “final stages”**.

**The Law Commission of India on sedition law:**

- The sedition law is **a reasonable restriction on the right to free speech.**
- _Repealing the legal provision_ can have **serious adverse ramifications for the security and integrity of the country**.
- Mere fact that a particular legal provision is colonial in its origin does not validate the case for its repeal.
- Jurisdictions like the US, UK, etc., **have actually merged their sedition law with counter-terror legislations.**

**Recommendations – Amend Section 124A of the IPC:**

- To bring about more clarity in the interpretation, understanding, and usage of the provision and to **align it with the SC’s 1962 verdict.**
- To replace mere inclination to incite violence or cause public disorder **with proof of actual violence or imminent threat to violence.**
- To enhance the alternative punishment to “7 years”, **giving the courts greater room to award punishment** in accordance with the gravity of the act.
- **Procedural safeguards** to minimise the abuse. **For example,** Section 154 of the CrPC could be amended to hold that a FIR under Section 124A would be registered only after a police officer conducts a **preliminary inquiry.**

### [Lateral Entry into Central Government](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/03/lateral-entry-into-central-government/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus****: Polity**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/17-senior-positions-in-central-government-to-be-filled-through-lateral-entry/article66920745.ece)

 **Context:** The Government has **decided to recruit 17 senior officers in the Central government** from the **private sector through** [**lateral entry**.](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/03/02/insights-into-editorial-lateral-entry-into-bureaucracy-reason-process-and-controversy/)

- This is **the fourth such recruitment drive proposed** to be undertaken by the government which had in **2018 initiated lateral entry to bring fresh talent and augment the availability of manpower.**

**About** [**Lateral Entry**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Lateral-Entry-in-Civil-Services.pdf)**:**

The term lateral entry relates to the **appointment of specialists, mainly those from the private sector, in government organisations.**

**Committees’ recommendations on lateral entry:**

- **The idea has been advocated by Surinder Nath Committee (2003), Hota Committee (2004) and** [**Second ARC (2008).**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/governance/role-of-civil-service-in-a-democracy/measures-or-recommendations-given-by-relevant-committees-to-address-any-concerns-associated-with-civil-service-in-india/)
- **NITI Aayog, in its three-year Action Agenda (2017—2020),** recommended the induction of personnel at middle and senior management levels in the central government.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Arguments in Favour of Lateral Entry**|**Arguments Against Lateral Entry**|
|Twin objective of **bringing in fresh talent and augmenting manpower.**|Difficulty adjusting to bureaucratic work culture.|
|**Domain expertise** synthesized with the multi-sectoral wisdom of the permanent civil service.|Short tenures are not conducive to **holding accountability.**|
|Increasing **complexity in governance** (e.g., digitalization, financial frauds, cybercrime).|**Lack of field experience**.|
|**Increased efficiency** through competition within governance.|**Need for a transparent process**|
||**Profit motive vs. public service**: Balancing profit orientation with public service objectives may be a challenge.|

**Conclusion:**

To make lateral entry successful, it is **essential to strike a balance between the advantages it brings and the challenges it poses**. The selection process **should be transparent and credible**, with **specific criteria that attract domain experts and eminent individuals.** Adequate training and support should be provided to lateral entrants to help them **navigate the bureaucratic work culture and ensure effective collaboration with existing civil servants.**

|**Treaty Revision**|Nepal’s request to revise the **1950 Friendship treaty** was perceived as unequal. Lack of progress in initiating talks or accepting EPG recommendations.|
|**China’s Influence**|Nepal’s increased engagement with China, including infrastructure agreements. Joining the Belt and Road Initiative. Concerns over Chinese interference in Nepali politics.|
|**Connectivity Issues**|Nepal seeking air connectivity, particularly through specific airports in India. Dependence on Indian permission for international flights. Infrastructure projects constructed by Chinese companies but requiring Indian viability.|
|**Economic Factors**|Transition to formal economy in India impacting informal trade arrangements. Difficulty in doing business with India compared to China. The decline in Indian investments was replaced by Chinese investments|
|**Terrorism**|Porous and poorly patrolled borders enabled the smuggling of weapons, ammunition, and counterfeit currency. Pose security risks to India from terrorist organizations and insurgent groups operating in India’s northeast.|
|**Trust Issues**|**Growing trust gap** due to the **slow pace of project implementation** by India. Perception of India’s interference in Nepal’s politics. Challenges in maintaining trust and political sovereignty.|

**Conclusion:**

India-Nepal relations require formal mechanisms to resolve boundary issues, drawing from successful resolutions in other regions. People-to-people interactions and updated discourse are crucial, considering Nepal’s federated governance and changing demographics.

### [ILO Monitor on the World of Work (11th edition)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/03/ilo-monitor-on-the-world-of-work-11th-edition/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Indian Economy and issues relating to Development and Employment**

**Source:** [**ILO**](https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---dcomm/---publ/documents/briefingnote/wcms_883341.pdf) 

**Context:** The [ILO](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/10/26/international-labour-organization/) Monitor on the World of Work database provides access to several of the indicators related to the labour market.

**Latest trends:** 

**Uneven impact of the poly-crisis (simultaneous occurrence of several catastrophic events):**

- **The war in Ukraine, effects of COVID-19 pandemic**, have resulted in the ongoing cost-of-living crisis, especially in developing countries.
- **Countries face a trade-off** in managing expected inflation, exchange rate movements, debt sustainability and economic activity.
- **Various global shocks and risks are holding back labour market recovery**, especially in low- and middle-income countries.

**Unemployment and the jobs gap:** Global unemployment is likely to return to the pre-pandemic level in 2023.

**Highlights of the ILO Monitor (11th edition):**

- **In 2023,** **the global jobs gap** (periods during one’s professional career when s/he did not have secure, formal employment) is projected to stand at 453 million people (11.7%), more than double the level of unemployment.
    - Low-income countries in debt distress face a jobs gap of 25.7% in 2023.
- Some countries are facing complex and cascading crises, like natural disasters (e.g. the earthquakes in Türkiye and Syrian Arab Republic), **which interact with broader global challenges and exacerbate labour market impacts.**
- **Significant social protection policy gaps** remain in developing countries, especially in low-income countries, including in regard to old-age pensions.
    - Only 38.6% of older persons in lower middle-income countries receive an old-age pension.

**Case of India: Unemployment rate** declined sharply in 2021 and 2022, **falling to 4.8%**, which is almost 2 percentage points below its level of 2019 (6.5%).

**Some of the labour reforms in India:**

- Labour falls under the **Concurrent List** of the Constitution.
- The central government replaced the 29 existing labour laws with **four Codes. These Codes regulate**: (i) Wages, (ii) Industrial Relations, (iii) Social Security, and (iv) Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions.
- **eShram:** This portal will help build a comprehensive National Database of Unorganised Workers (NDUW) in the country.
- **PM Shram Yogi Maan-dhan (PM-SYM):** Meant for old age protection and social security of Unorganised workers.
- **Aam Admi Bima Yojana:** Providing social security to unorganised sector workers.

**Recommendations:**

- **Building a national social protection floor:** For example, by expanding basic old-age pensions in developing countries.
    - This will act as a **catalyst for inclusive sustainable development and decent jobs.**
- **Policies and financial support:** To build resilience and overcome the global employment divide.
- **Build global financial resources:** The UN Global Accelerator on Jobs and Social Protection, and the Global Coalition for Social Justice can play a positive role here.

### [A new treaty for outer space](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/03/a-new-treaty-for-outer-space/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Developments in the field of Space**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/science-technology/un-recommends-new-treaty-to-ensure-peace-security-in-outer-space-89777)

 **Context:** The United Nations (UN) has recommended a new treaty for ensuring peace and security as well as preventing an arms race in outer space.

**What is outer space?**

- Outer space is the region **beyond a planet’s atmosphere**. For Earth, **it begins about 100 kms (62 miles) above sea level.**
- The line separating the atmosphere and outer space is called the **Karman line.**

**Background:**

- The recommendations, which are part of a **UN policy brief** (‘For All Humanity – The Future of Outer Space Governance’) come ahead of the **UN Summit of the Future**.
- At the Summit of the Future, member states will agree on **multilateral solutions for a better tomorrow and to strengthen global governance.**

**The new treaty for outer space:** 

**Need:**

- Over the past decade, **fundamental changes** have been witnessed in outer space like weaponisation of space, exponential increase in satellite launches, etc.
    - **For example,** there were 210 new launches in 2013, which increased to 600 (2019), 1,200 (2020) and 2,470 (2022).
    - This increase is fuelled by the **active participation of the private sector.**
- Outer space (like asteroids) contains **abundant deposits of valuable metals** (platinum, nickel, cobalt, etc) and governments are in favour of the exploitation of space resources.
- **Space debris is another issue.** More than 130 million smaller than one cm have been recorded.
- Currently, **there is no agreed international framework** on space resource exploration, exploitation and utilisation.
- **Conflict could arise** if countries do not agree on international principles and could also lead to **environmental degradation and cultural loss.**
- Hence, the development of international norms, rules and principles will ensure **effective governance, propel innovation and mitigate risks in outer space.**

**Existing treaties:**

- **The Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space:** Established in 1959 by the UN to review and enable international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space.
- **In 1963**, countries agreed to prohibit testing nuclear weapons in outer space.
- **In 1967, the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space**, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, was agreed upon.
    - It prohibits only weapons of mass destruction in outer space, not ordinary weapons.
- **In 2022, the UN members agreed upon a series of guidelines, frameworks and recommendations** on issues such as
    - Mitigation of space debris,
    - Nuclear power source safety,
    - The long-term sustainability of outer space activities and
    - Transparency and confidence-building measures in outer space activities.

**Key highlights of the recommended treaty:**

- **A combination of binding and non-binding norms** to address emerging risks to outer space security, safety and sustainability.
- **It will consider important legal issues**, including jurisdiction, control, liability and responsibility for environmental pollution in space for present and future generations.
- **An additional framework to prevent an armed conflict** in outer space and the weaponisation of outer space.
- **An effective framework for coordinating space situational awareness**, space object manoeuvres and events.
- **An effective framework for sustainable exploration**, exploitation and utilisation of the Moon and other celestial bodies for the benefit of all mankind.

 Virtual autism refers to the **sensory, motor, and socio-affective deprivation** experienced by **children aged 0-3 years** who spend **more than four hours a day** staring at screens.

This phenomenon, identified by **psychologist Marius Teodor Zamfir,** has similarities to behaviours found in children diagnosed with **autism spectrum disorder (ASD).**

**Reversing the effects of virtual autism** may involve a combination of therapies, including play therapy, psychomotor stimulation, language stimulation, and cognitive behaviour therapies.

**Usage**: The example can be used in Indian Society/Essay, to highlight the issues of digital addiction in children.

**Aim**: The draft bill aims to provide a **simplified approach to regulations (**including design, manufacture, possession, use, operation, sale, import, and export**)** in order to meet the **current needs of the civil aviation sector and** remove redundancies **present in the 1934 law.** It also seeks to **bring India in line with the Chicago Convention**.

**Major provisions:**

- Creation of two statutory bodies, namely the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security and the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau. These bodies would be responsible for implementing **the Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs)** prescribed under **the Chicago Convention** and would discharge regulatory and oversight functions.
- **Sufficient powers for the statutory regulatory bodies**, such as the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).

**About Chicago Convention**

Also known as the Convention on International Civil Aviation, it is an international treaty established in 1944. It sets out the core principles for international air transport and created the **International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)** to oversee its implementation. The convention recognizes **nine freedoms of air**, with the **first five being officially recognized by the ICAO**. These freedoms **grant countries the right to fly over**, land in, and transport passengers and cargo between territories.

  **India is its member**

 **Context:** The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) in India has transferred **cost-effective lithium-ion battery recycling technology** to nine recycling industries and start-ups as part of the **Mission LiFE under the “Promote circularity campaign**.”

This indigenous technology can process various types of **discarded lithium-ion batteries**, recovering over **95% of lithium**, **cobalt, manganese, and nickel** contents in the form of corresponding **oxides/carbonates** with a purity of about 98%.

**What is the recycling process?**

The recycling process of **lithium-ion batteries involves several steps**.

- First, the batteries are collected, sorted and disassembled
- Next, the electrodes, which contain valuable metals like lithium, cobalt, manganese, and nickel, are extracted, through a process called **leaching**, where the electrodes are submerged in a **liquid that dissolves these metals**.
- After that, the metals are **purified to remove impurities**, resulting in high-purity lithium, cobalt, manganese, and nickel compounds.

**Aim of recycling**: To recover valuable materials from lithium-ion batteries, reducing the need for mining and minimizing environmental impact. It helps conserve resources and promotes sustainable practices in battery manufacturing.

**Developed by**: The technology was developed at the Centre of Excellence on E-waste Management, in collaboration with the Government of Telangana and industry partner.

**About** 

India generates more than **50,000 tons of lithium-ion battery** waste annually, growing in the range of 40-80%. India currently imports **all of its Li from Australia and Argentina** and **70% of its Li-ion cell requirement** from China and Hong Kong.

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source: TH**

 **Context**: A new ‘smart bandage’ helps in treating chronic wounds in a **much more effective manner**.

**What is a smart bandage?**

- The **bandage works by using biosensors to track the chemical composition of the wound exudates,** which changes as the wound heals.
- It also monitors **pH and temperature to provide real-time information about infection and inflammation**. The bandage has a **hydrogel layer with electrodes that control the release of drugs**. It is **wireless, eliminating the need for bulky equipment and wired connections.**
- In tests, the bandage loaded with an **antimicrobial substance proved effective against bacteria** commonly associated with chronic wounds. It also **enhanced tissue regeneration in skin cell** **investigations**.
- When applied to wounds in diabetic mice, the bandage accurately detected infection, inflammation, and metabolic statuses. Diabetic rats treated with the bandage and a combination of drugs and electrical stimulation showed faster wound healing and less scarring compared to those without this treatment.
