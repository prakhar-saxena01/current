### [Demographic Dividend and unemployment problems in India, China](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/08/demographic-dividend-and-unemployment-problems-in-india-china/)

#### **GS Paper 1**

 **Syllabus:** **Population and Associated Issues**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/india-china-demographic-dividend-and-unemployment-problems-8651054/)

 **Context:** The current median Indian age of 28, as compared to China’s 39, suggests that India will continue to enjoy its demographic advantage up to the end of this century.

**Case of China:**

- **China’s youth population was declining** and the ageing population was rising.
- In 2023, **~12 million students in China** are expected to graduate.

**Challenges faced by China:**

- China is facing a new kind of epidemic: **joblessness**.
- **The job market was** hit hard by the Covid-19 lockdowns and massive layoffs in key sectors such as real estate, tech, and education.
- Growing demand for job security and **lack of employment opportunities**.

**What went wrong with China’s job market? The country’s growth was hit hard** during the Zero-Covid three years.

**Scenario in India:** Poor education, joblessness and a shortage of skilled personnel.

**Impact:**

- **Undocumented migration.**
- **The increasing rate of crimes:** India has become a hub for internet-based scams.

**What went wrong in India?**

- **2,500+ Industrial Training Institutes:** Established in the 1960s and run by state governments, have failed to update their skilling courses.
- **The National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC):** Created in 2003, NSDC’s short-duration courses (<1 year) are **insufficient for real skill acquisition.**
- **Sub-standard engineering colleges:** Mostly function as money-making enterprises, giving inadequate training.

**The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and jobs:**

- **The NEP 2020 introduced vocational training** for 6th, 7th and 8th-grade students to improve their skills in a particular field.
- **This has to continue at the secondary level**, with vocation-focused schools.

**What are the solutions?**

- **Job creation** is the topmost priority.
- **Skilling**, to effective outcome levels, should be the constant goal.
- **The NEP vision** should lead to a different kind of high school that continue with skilling training.
- **MSMEs** should be further incentivised as the major employment creators.
- **India must add to its inherent IT capabilities** without neglecting the manufacturing sector.

**Best practice – The German model of skill development:** It comprised two strictly separate sectors: the higher education system and the system of dual (at the company level and classes at a vocational school) vocational education and training.

**Conclusion:** Currently, India is taking minimal benefits of demographic dividends. In order to take full benefits of demographic dividends, high-quality jobs need to be created and highly skilled youths need to fill these jobs.

### [Role of Citizens in a representative democracy](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/08/role-of-citizens-in-a-representative-democracy/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Important aspects of governance, transparency and accountability, institutions**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/from-artists-to-lawmakers-8649343/)

 **Context:** In a representative democracy, the role of citizens is very critical.

**Representative vs direct democracy:**

- In a representative democracy, people vote for representatives who then vote on policy initiatives.
- In a direct democracy, people vote on policy initiatives directly.

**Basic principles of representative democracy:**

- Equality of all citizens before the law.
- Free and fair elections.
- **Principle of popular sovereignty:** Popular sovereignty is the principle of majority rule being used to carry out the political will of the people.
- **Political liberty:** This idea holds that people are free to enjoy fundamental liberties such as freedom of expression, assembly, movement, and thought.

**India’s representative democracy:** It is one of the largest and most complex in the world, where **elected representatives constitute** its federal democratic ethos – representing the aspirations of their electorate.

**Challenges faced by Indian representative democracy:**

- **Increasing ideological divisions** among political parties and their supporters.
- The spirit of consensus building is undermined, **hampering constructive debates and resulting in policy** **paralysis**.
- **Corruption in governance and personal values** erodes individual trust in institutions.
- The role of **money power in elections, identity politics, and inequitable opportunities** is hindering citizens’ right to ethical representation.

**Reforming representative democracy:**

- **Increasing people’s participation:** To transform representative democracy to participatory democracy to foster greater “democratisation” of political life.
    - **For example**, Gram Sabha [Article 243 (b)].
- **Strengthening federal democracy**: Decentralising power and empowering local governments can enhance accountability and promote citizen participation in matters of national importance.
    - **For example**, the 73rd and 74th Amendments to the Indian Constitution.
- **The National Legislators Conference (NLC):**
    - It is a pioneering initiative bringing together 4,000 MLAs and MLCs from all political parties under one roof.
    - The 3-day boot camp is an **opportunity to exchange notes across ideological lines, presenting case studies of best practices and governance**.

**Best practice – Switzerland:**

- **Direct democracy** is one of the special features of the Swiss political system.
- It is underpinned by two instruments: **initiatives** (to propose constitutional amendments or legislative enactment) and **referendums** (to express their opinion on decisions taken by the Swiss Parliament).

**Way ahead:**

- Explore the possibility of the **right to recall inefficient and corrupt politicians**.
- Strengthen **RTI and protect whistleblowers**.
- **Leveraging technology to improve governance**. With nearly 60% internet penetration in India and 600 million smartphone users, the legislators have an opportunity to reach out to the electorates.

**Conclusion:** Citizens have a very important role in a representative democracy as they exercise their rights and freedoms and benefit from the democratic setup of the country.

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus****: Social Justice – Education**

 **Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/nine-years-of-modi-govt-in-education-big-plans-some-key-gains-8651337/)

 **Context:** From a new policy that outlines the education roadmap for the next 20 years to sweeping changes in school textbooks and the opening up of the Indian higher education space to foreign players the education sector has made some positive changes in the past few years –

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Accomplishments**||
|[**New Education Policy**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/07/30/new-education-policy/) **(NEP) and Reforms**|The NEP 2020 is a policy document outlining a series of reforms to be **pursued in education till 2040**. India has had three policies to date.<br><br>The NEP 2020 proposes vital shifts — **from creating a system in which “children not only learn but more importantly learn how to learn**” to one in which **“pedagogy must evolve to make education more experiential, inquiry-driven, flexible**” and in which there is “**no hard separation between arts and sciences”.**|
|**National Curriculum Framework**|The **National Curriculum Framework (NCF),** is a crucial policy document for **revising textbooks and classroom pedagogy**. Among its key recommendations are **conducting board examinations twice a year, creating a semester system for Class 12 students, and providing students with the freedom to pursue a combination of science and humanities**, aiming to reduce the rigid boundaries between arts, commerce, and science in classes 11 and 12 across all school boards.|
|**School Textbooks**|The National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT), the apex body advising the Centre on school education, has **three rounds of revisions in school textbooks.**|
|**Foreign Universities**|The UGC is giving the final touches to a **regulation that would allow foreign universities to establish campuses in India** that have their own admission process, the freedom to determine fee structures and recruit faculty and staff from here and abroad.|
|**New Institutions, Enhanced Capacity**|In addition to the **new centrally-run educational institutions (including 7 IITs, 7 IIMs, 16 IIITs, and 15 AIIMS** of which 12 are partially or fully functional) set up in the last nine years, **there was a significant capacity enhancement of existing institutions by way of the EWS quota.**|
|**Female representation**|The supernumerary seats were introduced for women at IITs and NITs in 2018, resulting in a **rise in female representation from 9% in 2017 to 20% in 2022** at IITs over five years.<br><br>According to AISHE data, there **has been a reduction in gender disparity in higher education enrolment since 2014.**|
|**Other significant changes and initiatives in education**|The no-detention policy under the Right to Education Act 2009, which guaranteed promotion through Class 1 to 8, **was scrapped in 2019**.<br><br>A **single agency to conduct all entrance tests to higher education**, the National Testing Agency, was set up in 2017.<br><br>In a bid to end “inspector raj” and dismantle lobbies, the country’s apex medical education body, the Medical Commission of India, was dissolved in September 2020 and replaced with a new body – **National Medical Commission.**<br><br>**The Higher Education Financing Agency or HEFA was set up in 2017** to leverage funds from the market to finance infrastructure development in educational institutions through long-term loans.|

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Pending Initiatives**|   |
|**Autonomy**|A recent investigation revealed that despite the promises of increased autonomy under the IOE scheme, **much of it only exists in theory.**|
|**Vacant Faculty and Leadership Positions**|According to parliamentary records, **only 1,471 teachers have been hired across all central universities** since the start of this recruitment drive, and approximately 6,000 positions (almost 30% of the sanctioned posts) remain unfilled.|
|**National Research Foundation (NRF)**|intended to incentivise interdisciplinary research, **has not materialised despite being announced in consecutive union budget speeches from 2019 to 2021.**|
|**Higher Education Commission of India**|intended to replace UGC and AICTE as overarching regulator, **has yet to be established even five years after its initial announcement.**|
|**Digital University**|It was announced in last year’s union Budget speech but **has also failed to fructify thus far.**|

### [Climate-resilient agriculture](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/08/climate-resilient-agriculture/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Conservation, environmental pollution and degradation**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/agriculture/holistic-approach-makes-agrarian-systems-more-climate-resilient-study-89874)

 **Context:** As climate change can reduce agricultural income by 15-25%, it is high time that climate-resilient agriculture (CRA) is valued and implemented more rigorously.

**CRA:**

- **Resilience** is the capacity of a system to dynamically respond to, recover from and even thrive in changing climate conditions while maintaining essential functions, identities and structures.
- Hence, CRA is an approach of **sustainably using existing natural resources** to achieve long-term higher productivity and farm incomes under climate variabilities.

**Need:**

- **Extreme weather events** → reducing farm produce, food price fluctuations → endangering food security and farm incomes.
- Hence, to address climate change and achieve SDGs, **adaptation of appropriate mitigation technologies is required.**

**Outcomes of CRA:**

- Improved access and utilisation of technology,
- Increased use of resources conservation technologies,
- An increased adaptation of crops and livestock to climatic stress,
- **Reduces hunger and poverty** (by sustaining agricultural production).

**Strategies and technologies for climate change adaptation:**

- **Tolerant crops:** For example, **early maturing and drought-tolerant** green gram (BM 2002-1) was introduced by farmers in Aurangabad (MH).
- **Tolerant breeds in livestock and poultry:** Indigenous breeds are resistant to droughts, ability to ingest and digest low-quality feed, and resistance to diseases.
- **Feed management:** An adaptation measure, which can indirectly improve the efficiency of livestock production.
- **Water management/Water-smart technologies:** Like micro-irrigation, cover-crop method, deficit irrigation, precision estimation of crop water needs, etc.
- **Agro-advisory:** Response farming (farming with advisories) is an integrative approach already been taken in states like Tamil Nadu.
- **Soil organic carbon:** Different farm management practices –
    - Conservation agriculture technologies (reduced tillage, crop rotations, and cover crops),
    - Soil conservation practices (contour farming) and
    - Nutrient recharge strategies – can increase soil carbon stocks and stimulate soil functional stability.

**Govt efforts:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Government Efforts**|**Description**|
|**National Mission of Sustainable Agriculture**|Implemented in 2010 to promote the judicious management of available resources.|
|**Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY)**|Launched in 2015 to promote micro/drip irrigation for water conservation.|
|**Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana**|Executed to leverage climate-smart practices and technologies.|
|**Green India Mission**|Launched in 2014 to protect and restore forest covers, mitigating the effects of climate change.|
|**Soil Health Card scheme**|Launched to analyze soil samples and provide guidance to farmers regarding land fertility status.|
|**Neem-Coated Urea**|Introduced to minimize excess use of urea fertilizers and protect soil health.|
|**National Project on Organic Farming and National Agroforestry Policy**|Introduced to promote organic farming practices and agroforestry for income and ecosystem benefits.|
|**Organic farming initiatives in Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim**|States adopting and promoting organic farming practices.|
|**ICAR climate-resilient villages**|Establishment of climate-resilient villages in 151 districts, aiming to build carbon-positive villages.|
|**Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA)**|Initiated in 2005 to provide employment opportunities, economic security, and environmental protection.|

**Way ahead:**

- **Interventions focusing on** **improving crop productivity** (watershed development, enhancing irrigation) + **water management, soil health and livelihood diversification**.
- **There is a need to prioritise adaptive capacities** alongside agricultural productivity.
- **Reduction of GHG emissions** from all agriculture and non-agricultural sources has to be prioritised.
- **Structured training** is essential to build confidence in stakeholders and sensitise them to understand climate change events.
- **Fine-tuning the gap** between current management practices and essential agro-advisories.
- **Collaboration** between farmers, research institutions, funding agencies, governments, NGOs and private sectors to promote CRA.

**What is deconstruction theory?**

 Deconstruction theory is a **way of looking at language and meaning** that challenges the idea that words have fixed clear meanings. It suggests that meaning is not stable and can change depending on the context.

**Explanation using an example:**

Imagine you have a word like “**cat**.” In the traditional understanding, “cat” refers to a specific **animal with fur, whiskers, and a tail**. But deconstruction theory questions this idea. It asks, what if the word “cat” doesn’t have a fixed meaning? What if its meaning is influenced by other words and concepts?

For example, **think about the word “dog.”** The meaning of “cat” is not just about what a cat is, but also how it’s different from a dog. The meaning of “cat” depends on the **differences between cats and dogs.** This shows that meaning is not inherent in the word itself, but is created through relationships with other words and concepts.

**Deconstruction theory**, introduced by **Jacques Derrida**, has had a significant impact beyond literary criticism, influencing disciplines such as **anthropology, sociology, psychoanalysis, feminism, queer theory, art, and architecture.**

 **U****sage**: It can be used in Essay/Sociology/Anthropology Answer writings.

**Source:** [**ET**](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/et-editorial/in-defence-of-a-new-us-india-collaboration/articleshow/100829667.cms) 

**Context:** An agreement over joint manufacturing of **GE F414 jet engines for Navy fighter aircraft** by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) and General Electric (GE) is among the **early harvest of closer India-US defence ties** that may remove restrictions on armaments sales and technology transfer.

- This agreement involves a **100% transfer of technology**

**Other agreements:**

- Initiate negotiations for a **‘Security of Supply’ (SoS) arrangement** and a ‘**Reciprocal Defence Procurement’ (RDP)**
    - **SoS allows for priority delivery** for contracts from companies in either country
- India-U.S. agreed to establish **Defence Acceleration Ecosystem (INDUS-X),** a new initiative to advance **cutting-edge technology cooperation**.
- The US acknowledged **India’s leadership role** in Quad Indo-Pacific Maritime Domain **Awareness Initiative (IPMDA) (**A US-led initiative **to promote a free and open Pacific)**

**Significance:**

- **For India:** India’s previous attempt to develop an indigenous engine, the Kaveri project, failed to meet technical requirements. The new deal with the US is a crucial step towards building India’s own military-industrial complex in line with the goal of Atmanirbhar’s defence.
- **For the USA:** The US regards India as a strategic counterweight to China in the Indo-Pacific. Also, it is seeking resilience in defence production through collaboration with its partner countries, like India.

**India-US four foundational defence agreements:**

- **GSOMIA**, 2002 on military information exchange
- **LEMOA**, 2016 to use each other’s military base
- **COMCASA**, 2018 for interoperability between two militaries and the sale of high-end technology to India
- **BECA**, 2020 to share **high-end military technology**, **logistics and geospatial** maps

### [Why is the U.S. SEC cracking down on crypto exchanges?](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/08/why-is-the-u-s-sec-cracking-down-on-crypto-exchanges/)

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

 **Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/explained-why-us-sec-cracking-down-crypto-exchanges/article66940996.ece)

**Context:** The **U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)** is **cracking down on cryptocurrency exchanges.** The SEC filed over **a dozen charges against Binance**, alleging the exchange commingled billions of dollars of investors’ funds and routed them to a company in Europe.

- The **regulator claimed that Binance allowed high-value U.S. customers to access its international platform, misled investors** about trading controls, and commingled customer funds.

The SEC has **been pushing for crypto businesses and trading platforms to register with the regulator for investor protection and transparency**. However, industry leaders have been cautious about negotiating with the SEC due to its history of legal action against cryptocurrency companies. **The SEC’s aim seems to be bringing crypto exchanges under U.S. securities law.**

**Its Impact:**

- The SEC’s actions against Binance may **unsettle U.S.-based crypto traders who use its services and want to invest legally**.
- These events **could have an impact on the cryptocurrency market**, which is highly sensitive to regulatory news. Following the **SEC’s lawsuit against Binance, the prices of Bitcoin and Ether, two major cryptocurrencies, experienced declines.**

### [Ground-level ozone](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/08/ground-level-ozone/)

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/pollution/world-environment-day-2023-cse-finds-ground-level-ozone-pollution-in-delhi-ncr-all-year-problem-89810)

 **Context:** The Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) has issued an alert on rising ozone pollution and multi-pollutant crisis in the national capital on World Environment Day 2023 (June 5).

**World Environment Day (WED):**

- It is celebrated **annually on 5 June** and encourages awareness and action for the protection of the environment.
- It was **established in 1972** by the UN at the Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment. **In 1973,** the first WED was held with the theme “Only One Earth”.
- **WED 2023** is hosted by **Côte d’Ivoire** in partnership with the Netherlands with the theme **#BeatPlasticPollution.**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Ground-level ozone**|   |
|**Meaning**|Also known as tropospheric ozone, it is a colourless and highly irritating gas that forms just above (up to 2 miles) the Earth’s surface.|
|**Classification**|**It is a “secondary” pollutant** (not directly emitted into the air). It is produced when two primary pollutants [nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs)] react in sunlight and stagnant air.|
|**How are NOx and VOCs formed?**|**NOx and VOCs come from natural sources as well as human activities.** About 95% of NOx comes from the burning of coal, gasoline and oil in motor vehicles, etc. VOCs come mainly from gasoline production and combustion, residential wood combustion, etc.|
|**Harmful effects**|**On human health:** As ground-level ozone is a highly reactive gas, it has serious health consequences. This can inflame and damage airways, make lungs susceptible to infection, and aggravate asthma, and chronic bronchitis leading to increased hospitalisation.|
|**On ecosystems**: It can harm sensitive vegetation and forests, parks and wildlife refuges.|
|**The situation in India (2020 State of Global Air Report)**|Ozone is emerging as a serious public health issue in India (**17%↑** between 2010 and 2017). Age-standardised rates of death attributable to ground-level ozone are among the highest in India.|

**Highlights of the CSE analysis:**

- Ground-level ozone usually **exceeds the safety standard** (50 ppb over an 8-hour average) on all summer days in some locations in Delhi-NCR every year.
- Ground-level ozone, which should ideally become negligible in the night air, **remains a problem at night too in the Delhi-NCR region.**
- **Even winter months** (winter can inhibit the formation of ground-level ozone) in Delhi-NCR face excess ozone levels, **making it an all-year problem**.
