### [Mandya’s Hoysala legacy](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/24/mandyas-hoysala-legacy/)

#### **GS Paper 1**

**Syllabus:** **Indian Culture – Salient Aspects of Art Forms, Literature and Architecture from Ancient to modern times**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mandyas-hoysala-legacy-hidden-gems-that-beckon-history-buffs-attention/article66992768.ece)

 **Context:** The temples in the Mandya district of Karnataka, belonging to the period of the Hoysalas, have failed to grab as much attention as they deserve.

**The Hoysala Empire:**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hoysala.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hoysala.png)

- It was a **Kannadiga power** (founder – Sala) that ruled **most of what is now Karnataka** between the **10th – 14th centuries**.
- The capital of the Hoysalas was initially located at **Belur** but was later moved to **Halebidu**.
- Taking advantage of the warfare between the W**estern Chalukya Empire and Kalachuris of Kalyani**, the Hoysalas annexed the **fertile areas north of the Kaveri delta**.
- **By the 13th century**, they governed most of Karnataka, entire northwestern parts of Tamil Nadu and parts of western Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.

**Importance of the Hoysala era:**

- It was an important period in the development of **South Indian art, architecture, and religion**.
- The empire is remembered today primarily for **Hoysala architecture** – 100 surviving temples are scattered across Karnataka.
- **Well-known temples** – _Chennakeshava_ Temple in Belur, _Hoysaleswara_ Temple in Halebidu, _Chennakesava/Keshava_ Temple in Somanathapura (Mysuru), etc., are known as **an amazing displays of sculptural exuberance**.

**Architectural features of Hoysala temples:**

- Most of the temples follow the **ekakuta, dvikuta or trikuta pattern** – temples with a single, double or three garbhagrihas or sanctum sanctorum.
- **There are only two examples of Panchakuta shrines or temples** – Keshava temple and the Panchalingeshwara temple (Mandya).

**Famous temples in Mandya district:**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Temples**|**Image**|**Description**|
|**Panchalingeshwara temple**|[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/panchalinga.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/panchalinga.png)|**Panchakuta shrine,** with five sanctums containing five shivalingas.<br><br>At the doorways are **two dwarapalas guarding the sanctum**, and the signature of the famous sculptor of the Hoysala period **Mallithamma** is clearly visible even today|
|**Lakshminarayana temple**|[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/elephanta.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/elephanta.png)|Built on a high platform with stellate corners with **elephant** sculptures that is typical of most Hoysala temples.<br><br> **A fine specimen of Hoysala style** known for ornate embellishment with sculptures and carvings that is evident both in the temple **interiors and the outer walls**.<br><br>**Wall panels have remarkable sculptures** of Panduranga, Govardhanadhari, Dhanavantri, and Dakshinamurthi, etc.|
|**Brahmeshwara temple**|[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/brameshwara.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/brameshwara.png)|Constructed during the **regime of Narasimha I** with all the salient features attributable to the Hoysala architecture.|
|**Saumyakeshava temple**|[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/saumyaka.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/saumyaka.png)|Dated to the 12th century CE and renovated by successive dynasties, it has **both Vijayanagar and post-Vijayanagar features.**|

**Reasons why Mandya’s temples are less popular among tourists:**

- **Proximity to Mysuru**, a popular tourist destination, has robbed the sheen off Mandya.
- This is despite the fact that **Mandya has 50** State-protected and Centre-protected monuments against **39** in the Mysuru district.

**Way ahead:**

- **Installing signboards** giving cross-references to important monuments in the district in places where tourist footfalls are high.
- With the popularity of these monuments, **efforts to conserve the architectural marvels** (most of which are nearly 1000 years old) should grow.

**Conclusion:** Bringing the lesser-known monuments to public light is important not only from a tourism perspective but to showcase a slice of history and heritage.

### [Pollution due to coal-based thermal power generation in India](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/24/pollution-due-to-coal-based-thermal-power-generation-in-india/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Environmental Pollution and Degradation**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/pollution/only-5-of-india-s-coal-based-thermal-power-capacity-meets-so2-emissions-norms-cse-report-90229)

 **Context:** One of the most polluting sectors of India – coal-based thermal power generation – was **found to be brazenly flouting emission norms.**

**Emission norms in place:** The MoEFCC made it **mandatory** (in 2015) for thermal power plants **to install a flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) system** to remove sulphur dioxide from their exhaust.

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/spray.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/spray.png)

**Status of implementation:**

- **Poor implementation** of the sulphur dioxide emissions regulations.
- **For example,**
    - Only 5% of the country’s installed coal-based thermal power generation capacities had the FGD mechanism in place. (CSE)
    - 17% of the overall coal power capacity was still at the very initial stages of compliance.

**Regional data on implementation status:**

- **No plant in eastern India** was found to be compliant with SO2 emissions norms.
- **Maharashtra** has the highest capacity to comply with the norms, followed by **Gujarat, UP, Haryana and Tamil Nadu.**

**What do these results indicate?**

- **The sector has been unwilling to comply** with the central government regulations. Even new projects are not compliant with the SO2 emissions norms.
- **This is despite the fact that the norms have been diluted** for several parameters and deadlines delayed since they were issued.

**Reasons for the delayed implementation of the norms:** The sector’s dependency on the external market for some FGD components, the novelty of the technology for the Indian market and the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Impact of poor implementation:**

- Sulphur dioxide released in the open (without desulphurisation) causes **pollution**.
- When sulphur dioxide combines with water and air, it forms **sulfuric acid**, which is the main component of **acid rain**.
- Acid rain can cause **deforestation, acidify waterways** to the detriment of aquatic life, and be **detrimental to human health** (skin cancer).

**Challenges ahead: A total of 20 thermal plants are now being built** with a combined capacity of **27.4 GW**, which will likely be included in the national capacity by the end of 2027–2028.

**Way ahead:**

- The latest National Electricity Plan (NEP) for 2022-32 has advocated for **different standards for plants in different locations.**
- The Government should not further extend the deadline for compliance.
- It should be **mandatory for new units** to install the FGD system, only then they can begin operations.

**Why did Syama Prasad Mookerjee resign?**

He resigned from the Union cabinet (Minister for Industry and Supply) **due to his disagreement with the controversial Nehru-Liaquat Pact**, which he believed would leave **Hindus in East Bengal at the mercy of the Pakistani stat**e and go against his vision of a divided Bengal with West Bengal for Hindu Bengalis.

- He also opposed **special status to Jammu and Kashmir**. His famous slogan was “Ek desh mein do Vidhan, do Pradhan aur Do Nishan nahi chalenge” (trans: “**One country cannot have two constitutions, two prime ministers and two flags”),** referring to the provisions of Article 370.

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**LM**](https://www.livemint.com/)

**Context:**  India’s Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act) is being **updated as the Digital India Bill.**

**What is Technology Facilitated Gender Based Violence (TFGBV)?**

Technology Facilitated Gender Based Violence (TFGBV) refers to the **use of technology, such as the internet, social media platforms, or mobile devices**, to perpetrate acts of violence, harassment, stalking, coercion, or abuse against individuals based on gender or sexual identity.

- **Existing social norms and the widening gender digital divide** increase the vulnerability of groups already vulnerable to online violence.

**Issues with the present legal framework:**

- **India’s present legal frameworks** are not equipped to tackle internet-based harms.
- **The Indian Penal Code, 1860**, and the **Criminal Procedure Code, 1973**, were enacted to address physical harm, but they are **also being applied in the online space**.
- **The Information Technology Act, 2000**, was promulgated in the early days of the internet and as such **unable to deal with the recent nature**, forms and volume of online violence.
- None of these laws specifically addresses **the issue of gender violence** in tech space.

**The proposed Digital India Bill should incorporate sufficient safeguards against these types of crimes.**

### [Chiral Bose-liquid state](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/24/chiral-bose-liquid-state/)

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/what-is-the-chiral-bose-liquid-state/article66992947.ece)

 **Context:** Recent research suggests that **the chiral Bose-liquid state could be a completely new form of matter**.

- Typically, **matter exists in solid, liquid, or gas states**. However, at **extremely low temperatures or within the quantum realm, matter behaves differently.**

**About Quantum states of matter:**

- Quantum states of matter **exhibit unique behaviours distinct from our familiar solid, liquid, and gaseous states.**
- Frustrated quantum systems, in particular, involve the interactions of particles **leading to infinite possibilities**. In these systems, **collisions can produce unexpected outcomes, such as levitating or defying traditional angles.**

**How it was formed:**

The chiral bose-liquid state is formed by **bringing two layers of a special material very close together at very low temperatures (close to absolute Zero).** One layer has an abundance of **electrons**, while the other layer has “**holes**” where electrons can go. When these layers are brought together, a local imbalance is created, causing **electrons to not have enough holes to fill**. This imbalance triggers the **formation of the chiral bose-liquid state**, which has unique properties and behaviours.

This unique state **allows electrons to freeze into predictable patterns, exhibit resilience to changes in spin (a characteristic of subatomic particles), and synchronize their movements**.

**Why it is called ‘Chiral’?**

The term “**chiral**” refers to a property in physics where an object or system cannot be superimposed onto its mirror image. In the context of the chiral bose-liquid state, the term “chiral” is used because the electrons in the chiral bose-liquid state move or behave differently compared to their **mirror-image counterparts**, leading to unique and asymmetric characteristics.

**Application**: The state could be useful for encryption technology in the future.

 **Context:** Recently, many actresses have chosen to **preserve their baby’s cord blood.**

**About Cord Blood:**

- Cord blood is a **rich source of stem cells** that can potentially be used in the treatment of certain **blood, immune, and metabolic disorders**.
- Private stem cell banking companies offer community or social banking options where **stored cord blood is accessible to registered individuals**.
- These community banks have a **larger pool of donors, increasing the chances of finding a match for patients in need**.
