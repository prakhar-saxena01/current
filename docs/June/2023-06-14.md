### [Assistive technology to make urban centres disabled friendly](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/14/assistive-technology-to-make-urban-centres-disabled-friendly/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Mechanisms for the Protection and Betterment of Vulnerable Sections**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/urban-centres-must-be-disabled-friendly-inclusivity-is-a-theme-in-indias-g20-presidency-8657607/)

 **Context:** Assistive technology – products, equipment, and systems that enhance learning, working, and daily living for persons with disabilities (PwD) – can aid PwD, enabling their full participation in urban life.

**Need for inclusive cities:**

- **India is urbanising rapidly** and the country’s urban population is **estimated to cross 675 million by 2030.**
    - According to the 2011 Census, 1 in 3 PwD in India or **roughly 8 million people already live in cities**.
- **The number of PwD as a share of the population could rise** due to disaster and climate risks, demographic changes and broader definitions of disability in line with global norms.

**Solution – Innovative technology and ICT:** These are key to ensuring an **inclusive urban transformatio**n and **essential for improving and increasing the quality of life** of all citizens.

**Importance of assistive technology:**

- **Manasi Joshi**, a para-badminton player, underwent a double leg amputation following a road accident at age 22.
- **Availability of assistive technology** empowered her by not only helping her overcome obstacles she faced in everyday tasks but also encouraging her to realise her dream of playing professional badminton.

**Advantages to India:** India has a **world-class digital governance system** and dynamic tech sectors converging to deliver inclusive prosperity and resilience.

**Challenges:** Innovations that promote inclusivity are often perceived as **unprofitable** by investors.

**Steps taken:**

- **The Smart Solutions Challenge and Inclusive Cities Awards:** It was launched in India (2022) by the National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA) and the UN, **to enhance the ecosystem for assistive technology and inclusive solutions.**
    - It helped in **crowd-sourcing tech-based solutions and innovations** for addressing city-level accessibility and inclusion challenges.
- **Start-up 20 Engagement Group:** As part of its G20 Presidency, India has initiated the group to provide a global platform to enable the start-up ecosystem across the member nations.
- **G20 Digital Innovation Alliance (G20-DIA):** Launched by MeitY to showcase innovative solutions and create an alliance of players in the innovation ecosystem.
- **Urban-20 Engagement Group under G20:** It seeks to discuss how data and technology can be best utilised for making city management more effective and inclusive [Theme – ‘Catalysing Digital Urban Futures’].
- **Artificial Limbs Manufacturing Corporation (ALIMCO):** Incorporated in 1972, ALIMCO is a **Central Public Sector unit** engaged in the manufacture and supply/distribution of Assistive Devices for PwDs.

**Way ahead:**

- **The role of the state becomes critical** for promoting an ecosystem for transformative technologies, especially where the return on investment may be difficult to measure.
- **Behavioural changes, capacity building, investments and policies** for accessible infrastructure and inclusive and accessible innovations for creating an inclusive and accessible India.

**Best practices:**

- **Smart cities like Bhubaneswar** have deployed innovative transport and mobility solutions.
- **Fifth Sense, IncluMaps, AxcessAble and myUDAAN:** These are the assistive technologies supporting independent living for PwD.

**Conclusion:** Accessible India is crucial for the country’s progress towards **SDG targets and** **an equitable urban future as envisioned for the Amrit Kaal** – an inclusive, accessible, safe, resilient, and sustainable India@2047.

### [U.S. decides to rejoin UNESCO](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/14/u-s-decides-to-rejoin-unesco/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-decides-to-rejoin-unesco-and-pay-back-dues-to-counter-chinese-influence/article66960485.ece)

 **Context:** The United States has announced its decision to rejoin the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) and **pay over $600 million in back dues.**

**Background of the US and UNESCO issue:**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Year**|**Description**|**Reason**|
|**1945**|The United States initially joined UNESCO in 1945, seeing it as an important **platform for promoting international cooperation** in education, science, and culture.|The U.S. believed in the importance of international cooperation and saw UNESCO as a means to promote its values and interests in these areas.|
|**1984**|In 1984, under the **Reagan administration**, the U.S. withdrew from the organization.|The Reagan administration believed that UNESCO was not effectively fulfilling its mandate, and was **mismanaged and corrupt**. Its actions were influenced by **political biases that favoured the Soviet Union.**|
|**2003**|The U.S. rejoined UNESCO in 2003 under the **George W Bush** administration.|This decision was driven by a desire to re-engage with multilateral institutions and rebuild diplomatic relationships.|
|**2011**|In 2011, the U.S. and Israel **suspended their funding to UNESCO** and eventually lost their voting rights.|The U.S. and Israel believed that UNESCO’s decision to admit Palestine undermined the prospects for Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations and took measures to protest against it.|
|**2017**|In 2017, under the **Trump administration**, the U.S. announced its decision to withdraw from UNESCO altogether.|The Trump administration perceived UNESCO to have an **anti-Israel bias** and raised concerns about the **effectiveness and value of the organization’s programs.** The administration also expressed **concerns about the effectiveness and value of UNESCO’s programs.**|
|**2023**|**The US plans to rejoin UNESCO in 2023**, reflecting a shift in the country’s stance under the Biden administration.|The U.S. is concerned about **China’s increasing influence in UNESCO**, especially in areas related to technology and artificial intelligence. By rejoining UNESCO, the Biden administration **aims to assert U.S. interests, ensure representation**, and shape global standards in these critical fields.|

**Significance of the US rejoining UNESCO:**

- **Financial boost:** US contributed **22% of the agency’s overall** funding before leaving.
- **Global Leadership:** The U.S. brings substantial resources, expertise, and influence, which can help drive international cooperation and shape global agendas in these areas.
- **Counterbalancing China:** The U.S. rejoining UNESCO allows it to counterbalance China’s growing influence within the organization.
- **Multilateral Engagement**: This move reinforces the importance of international cooperation and strengthens **diplomatic ties with other member states**.
- **Preservation of Cultural Heritage**: UNESCO plays a crucial role in preserving cultural heritage sites worldwide.
- **Climate Change and Sustainable Development**: The U.S.’s re-engagement in these initiatives can enhance global efforts to mitigate climate change, protect biodiversity, and promote sustainable practices.

### [The Hiroshima AI process](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/14/the-hiroshima-ai-process/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Awareness in the fields of IT, Space, Computers, Robotics, Nano-technology, Bio-technology and issues relating to Intellectual Property Rights**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/hiroshima-ai-process-g7-explained/article66959829.ece)

**Context:** The 2023 annual G7 Summit, hosted by Japan (Hiroshima), initiated the Hiroshima AI Process (HAP) – an effort to determine a way forward to regulate artificial intelligence (AI).

**Background:** The G7 Digital and Tech Ministers discussed **responsible AI and global AI governance** –

- To promote human-centric and trustworthy AI based on the OECD AI Principles and
- To foster collaboration to maximise the benefits for all brought by AI technologies.

**What is HAP?**

- It recognised the need to immediately take stock of the **opportunities and challenges of** [**generative AI**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/12/generative-ai/#:~:text=What%20is%20Generative%20AI%3F,or%20other%20types%20of%20media.)**,** which is increasingly prominent across countries and sectors.
- **It encourages discussions** on generative AI in cooperation with the OECD and [GPAI](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/06/16/global-partnership-on-artificial-intelligence-gpai/) to conduct practical projects.
- **These discussions** could include topics such as **governance, safeguard of IPR** (including copyrights), response to foreign information manipulation (including disinformation) and responsible utilisation of these technologies.

**Significance of the HAP:**

- **It will highlight the shared values and standards** that can be used to derive guiding principles (fairness, accountability, transparency, and safety) for the regulation of AI.
- **AI development and implementation** will help in aligning with values such as freedom, democracy and human rights.
- **An emphasis on multi-stakeholder international cooperation** indicates that the HAP isn’t expected to address AI regulation from a State-centric perspective.

**Challenges:**

- **Divergence among G7 countries.**
- **G7 countries are acting on their own** instead of waiting for the outcomes from the HAP.
- The relationship between **AI and IPR** is not clear.

**Way ahead:**

- **A common guideline for G7 countries** that permits the use of copyrighted materials.
- **An interoperable AI governance framework** to respond to the concerns of other country groups as well.
- **Like-minded approaches and policy instruments** to achieve the common vision and goal of trustworthy AI.

**Conclusion:** Overall, the establishment of the HAP makes one thing clear: AI governance has become a truly global issue that is likely to only become more contested in future.

### [Government Intervention in Free Speech](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/14/government-intervention-in-free-speech/)

#### **GS Paper ₹4**

 **Syllabus: Ethical Values and their applications**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/former-twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-on-pressure-from-india-govt-during-farmers-protest/article66963182.ece#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAnd%20it%20manifested%20in%20ways,democratic%20country%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20elaborated.)**,** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/apar-gupta-writes-cowin-breach-jack-dorsey-claims-digital-india-is-not-built-on-constitution-8661042/)

 **Context:**  Jack Dorsey, **the former CEO of Twitter**, claimed that **the Indian government threatened to shut down the social media platform in the country.**

**Issues highlighted:**

- **India made numerous requests related to the farmers’ protests and critical journalists**, and the government used tactics like raiding Twitter employees’ homes and threatening to close Twitter offices.
- **India and China could apply pressure on Elon Musk**, who has business interests in those countries, to influence Twitter’s policies.
- The Indian government had **demanded the shutdown of certain accounts and the disclosure of contact information.**
- The government sought to censor tweets **critical of their handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, and there were claims that Twitter censored right-wing voices**.
- The government is **also considering a Digital India Bill** that m**ay eliminate the safe harbour concept and increase legal consequences for platforms** that do not remove government-notified misinformation.

**Other issues influencing the idea of Digital India:**

- A data breach on the **CoWIN platform was reported,** but the government denied it.
- Second, a **Global DPI Summit organized by the Ministry of Electronics and IT took place, emphasizing the Digital Public Infrastructure framework.**

These events **demonstrate the lack of governance processes, accountability mechanisms, and adherence to constitutional frameworks in India’s digital systems.**

**Ethical issues involved in the case:**

- **Freedom of speech and expression**: Critics argue that by blocking accounts and content, Twitter may be suppressing dissenting voices and limiting the free flow of information.
- **Impartiality and bias**: Accusations of political bias can undermine trust in the platform and raise questions about the fairness of its content moderation practices.
- **Compliance with local laws**: Critics argue that Twitter’s compliance with Indian laws may compromise its commitment to global human rights principles.
- **Corporate responsibility and accountability:** Ethical concerns arise when executives make claims that are disputed by the government or other stakeholders.
- **Privacy and user data protection**: Governments’ requests for user information and potential surveillance can infringe upon users’ privacy rights and raise questions about the platform’s commitment to protecting user data.
- **Relationship with governments:** Ethical considerations come into play when platforms must navigate demands from governments that may infringe on human rights or limit freedom of expression.

**Conclusion:**

Addressing these ethical issues requires a **careful balance between respecting local laws, protecting user rights, ensuring transparency and accountability**, and upholding global human rights standards. It highlights the need for **robust policies and practices within social media companies to navigate these complex ethical challenges effectively**.

The lower house of Japan’s parliament passed a bill aimed at **promoting LGBTQ+ awareness**. While support for LGBTQ+ rights has grown among the Japanese public, opposition remains strong within some sections of conservative institutions.  However, recent surveys indicate **majority support for legalizing same-sex marriage** and other protections, including among the business community.

**Usage**: You can cite this example in Polity/Ethics to show legal efforts towards making the world more inclusive.

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/rbi-permits-loan-default-guarantee-in-digital-lending-to-boost-fintech-activity-8654538/)

 **Context:** The RBI has allowed a **Default loss guarantee (DLG) (also called first Loss Default Guarantee (FLDG)**, a safety-net arrangement among banks, non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) and lending service providers (LSPs).

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FLDG.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FLDG.png)

**LSPs:** These are new-age technology platforms/ agents (of a bank or NBFC) in the lending space who carry out one or more of a lender’s functions on behalf of regulated entities (REs).

**What is an FLDG arrangement?**

- It is an arrangement whereby **a third party** such as a financial technology (fintech) player (LSP) **compensates lenders if the borrower defaults.**
- For all practical purposes, **credit risk is borne by the LSP** without having to maintain any regulatory capital.

**Previous arrangement:**

- RBI had expressed reservations about the FLDG arrangement because it felt that **the model could pose a systemic risk.**
- **The RBI guidelines (2022)** on digital lending did not provide clarity on the FLDG structure.

**New guidelines:**

- The RBI **permitted FLDG arrangements** between banks and fintech or between two REs.
- The LSP-providing DLG must be incorporated as a company under the **Companies Act, 2013.**
- Banks and NBFCs should ensure that the total amount of DLG cover on any outstanding portfolio **does not exceed 5% of the amount of that loan portfolio.**

 **Context:** Researchers at IIT Kanpur have developed **India’s first 100% Dimethyl Ether (DME)-fuelled tractor/vehicle**, marking a significant step towards a sustainable alternative fuel-based transport system.

**What is Dimethyl Ether?** 

**Dimethyl Ether (DME) is a renewable and clean-burning alternative fuel** that can be used in various applications, including **transportation**. Under normal atmospheric conditions, **DME is a colourless gas**.  It is produced from **natural gas, coal, biomass, or renewable sources** through a synthesis process.

**Uses**: It is used extensively in the chemical industry and as a **solvent, fuel, and refrigerant (**ozone-friendly aerosol propellant to replace CFCs). DME has **properties similar to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)** and can be easily stored and transported.

Several countries, including **Japan, the USA, China, Sweden, Denmark, and Korea**, already use DME to power vehicles. However, the use of DME in internal combustion engines is relatively unexplored in India.

The research is overheated by the **Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB)** (under the Department of Science and Technology (DST) and is aligned with the **‘Methanol Economy’** program of NITI Ayog.
