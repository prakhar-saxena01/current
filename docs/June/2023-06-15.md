### [Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/15/production-linked-incentive-pli-schemes/)

#### **GS2/GS3 Paper** 

 **Syllabus: Government Policies & Interventions**

**Source:** [**PIB**](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1932051)

 **Context:** The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes in India have had a positive impact on production, employment generation, economic growth, and exports.

**About PLI Scheme:** 

In the PLI Scheme, **companies receive financial incentives or rewards** based on their production and sales. For example, if a company makes more smartphones in India, they can earn a bonus from the government. This encourages companies to increase production, create jobs, and boost the country’s economy.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Aspect**|**Details**|
|**Objective**|Scale up domestic manufacturing capability, increase import substitution, and generate employment.|
|**Initial Targeted Industries**|Mobile and allied Component Manufacturing, Electrical Component Manufacturing, and Medical Devices. Now expanded to Automobile and auto components, Electronics and IT hardware, Telecom, Pharmaceuticals, Solar modules, Metals and mining, Textiles and apparel, White goods, Drones, Advanced chemistry cell batteries, and other sectors as well.|
|**Incentives**|Calculated based on **incremental sales. Range from 1% to 20%** depending on the industry.|
|**Additional Incentives**|In some sectors such as **advanced chemistry cell batteries, textile products**, and the **drone industry**, the incentive is based on **sales, performance, and local value addition achieved over a period of five years.**|

**The success of the PLI Scheme** (data from the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT)):

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Key Highlights of PLI Schemes**|**Details**|
|**Increase in FDI**|**76% increase in FDI** in the Manufacturing sector in FY 2021-22 compared to the previous year; Drugs and Pharmaceuticals (+46%), Food Processing Industries (+26%) and Medical Appliances (+91%).|
|**Value addition**|**20% value addition achieved** in mobile manufacturing within a period of 3 years|
|**India’s exports basket**|PLI Schemes have transformed India’s export basket from **traditional commodities to high-value-added products.** Exports boosted by **Rs 2.56 Lakh Crore** till FY 2022-23|
|**Investment**|733 applications approved to date in 14 sectors with an expected investment of **Rs. 3.65 Lakh Crore.** Rs. 62,500 Crore investment realized till March 2023, resulting in employment generation of around 3,25,000|
|**Indian farmers and MSMEs in the food processing sector**|PLI Scheme for Food Processing positively had a positive impact on the income of Indian farmers and MSMEs|
|**Import substitution**|Import substitution **of 60% achieved in the Telecom sector**, making India self-reliant in Antennae, GPON, and CPE|
|**Growth in the drones sector**|Drones sector turnover has seen a **7 times jump due to the PLI Scheme**|
|**Reduction in imports**|Significant reduction in imports of raw materials in the **Pharma sector**, transfer of technology in the manufacturing of Medical Devices|

**Challenges associated with the scheme:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Challenges**|**Examples**|
|**Lack of clarity**|In the electric auto industry, firms are looking for clarity on the incentives they are supposed to receive. In 2022-23, incentives **could not be disbursed because no auto company** presented the required documents.|
|**Lack of disbursements**|In 2022-23, the government paid Rs. 2,874 crore to beneficiaries against a claim of Rs. 3,420 crore in various sectors.|
|**Insufficient investment**|The **low disbursement of incentives** suggests that the PLI scheme may not have resulted in the expected level of investment. 6 of the 14 sectors including textiles, solar PV modules, and advanced chemistry cell (ACC) batteries are lagging.|
|**Affects competition**|The state’s decision to **select champions and provide fiscal incentives** could affect competition in the targeted sectors.|
|**Documentation issues**|Without the required documents, incentives cannot be disbursed to the eligible companies.|
|**Limited outgo of allocated funds**|The actual disbursement of funds has been significantly lower than the allocated budget for the scheme.|

**Conclusion:**

Policymakers **should not excessively depend on the PLI scheme**. It is not a way out of the inadequacies in the manufacturing sector. Modern manufacturing depends on **complex supply chains and giving fiscal incentives** to one set of producers may not work. So, the government will have to work on **improving the overall industrial environment**.

### [Child trafficking in India](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/15/child-trafficking-in-india/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Mechanisms, Laws, Institutions and Bodies constituted for the Protection and Betterment of the Vulnerable Sections**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/explained-what-has-india-done-to-address-child-trafficking/article66945216.ece#:~:text=The%20Prohibition%20of%20Child%20Marriage,during%20the%20COVID%2D19%20pandemic.)

 **Context:** Several reports since the 2020 lockdown have noted that the **pandemic created a second crisis of child trafficking**, with children being pushed into “despair, disease and death.”

**Child trafficking:**

- **Child labour** is a form of modern slavery that includes any work that deprives children of their childhood, potential and dignity, and physical or mental development. (ILO)
- **The practice includes trafficking**, sexual exploitation, debt bondage, and exploitation in armed conflicts.
- **Child trafficking** manifests in the form of domestic labour, forced child labour across industries, and illegal activities such as begging, organ trade and commercial sex purposes.
- Estimates show that children account for **one in every three detected victims of trafficking worldwide.**

**Prevalence in India:**

- According to the NCRB, **8 children were trafficked every day in India in 2021** for labour, begging and sexual exploitation.
- **95%** of the reported cases in 2019 were of **internal trafficking**.
- The sale of children happens **across borders too**, with key routes being India to **Gulf States** (for ‘khadama’ to work as housemaids) **and South East Asian countries**.

**Most vulnerable:** Minor girls in the age bracket 15-18 years, as they are in greater demand for the sex trade industry and domestic labour.

**Main reasons for child trafficking in India:**

- Poverty, hunger, and lack of work.
- This year’s **World Day Against Child Labour** (June 12) emphasised **social injustices** (caste and community-based discrimination and unfair treatment) as the root causes of child labour and trafficking.
- Externalities such as the **COVID-19 pandemic, armed conflict, and climate change**.
- Vulnerable to **online** sexual predators.
- More than 40% of children trafficked were **recruited by a family member or relative.**

**Laws governing anti-trafficking crimes:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Laws**|**Salient Provisions/ Issues**|
|**The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act 1956**|It is targeted at stopping immoral trafficking and sex work.<br><br>It is criticised for criminalising sex workers without providing sufficient legal recourse or scope for rehabilitation, **falsely presuming that all trafficking is done for sex work only.**|
|**The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act 2006**|It prohibits and penalises the act of child marriage.<br><br>However, there is a **rise in child marriage and sexual abuse** during the COVID-19 pandemic.|
|**The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act 1986**|In 2016, an amendment completely banned the employment of children below 14 years; adolescents aged 14-18 years are not allowed to work in hazardous working conditions.|
|**The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act 1976**|It prohibits systems of labour where people, including children, work under conditions of servitude to pay off debt, and also provides a framework for rehabilitating released labourers.<br><br>22 States and UTs **did not report identifying any bonded labour victims or filing a case under the law.**|
|**The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act 2015**|It governs laws relating to children alleged and found to be in conflict with the law.|
|**Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act 2012**|It seeks to prevent commercial sexual exploitation of children.|
|**The Trafficking in Persons (Prevention, Care and Rehabilitation) Bill**|The MWCD published the Draft of the Bill in 2021, **detailing measures to prevent, protect and rehabilitate victims**.<br><br>There are specified penalties for offences divided into “**trafficking**” and “**aggravated** **trafficking**”. It widened the scope of “victims” to include **transgender persons**.|

**The penalty for trafficking minors:**

- **For trafficking one minor** imprisonment from 10 years to life, along with a fine.
- **For trafficking more than one minor**, the penalty is life in prison and a fine.

**Anti-Human Trafficking Units (AHTUs):**

- **India set up AHTUs in 2007**, which are tasked with addressing the existing gaps in the law enforcement response, ensuring a victim-centric approach, developing databases on traffickers, etc.
- **As of 2022, 768 AHTUs are functional in the country**; 20 out of 36 States and UTs have met the target of setting units across all districts.

**Concerns:**

- **Gross underestimate of the true extent:** Child trafficking does not account for missing children **–** 1 child goes missing every 8 minutes in India.
    - This is mainly due to a **lack of awareness about the modalities of trafficking**, reluctance to seek police help and socio-economic deprivation.
- **Low conviction:** Less than 10% of the reported cases end up in convictions.
- **Lack of coordination among AHTUs** and disjointed operations by State and Central Governments.
- **Absence of a witness protection framework** (the victim is also the witness) and challenges in accessing compensation.
- **The Trafficking in Persons Bill** violates the Juvenile Justice Act, as it places the **burden of proof on the offender** (the child) rather than the prosecuting agency.
- **The 2022 Trafficking in Persons Report:**
    - India **does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking** but is making significant efforts to do so.
    - **India doesn’t have a composite anti-trafficking law** that addresses prevention, protection, rehabilitation and compensation of survivors.

**Way ahead:**

- **Community-based rehabilitation** models allow the greater agency to the individual.
- **Revisit existing laws** to plug legal holes.
- **Cultivate awareness about different trafficking crimes**, and form targeted child protection schemes.

**Conclusion:** The antidote to poverty-driven child labour is decent work for adults, so they can support their families and send their children to school, not to work. (ILO Director-General Gilbert F. Houngbo)

### [Use of ‘Water as a Weapon of War’](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/15/use-of-water-as-a-weapon-of-war/)

#### **GS Paper 3/2**

 **Syllabus:** **Internal Security/ Effect of Politics of Developed and Developing Countries on India’s Interests**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/why-the-collapse-of-ukraine-kakhovka-dam-ecological-disaster-8657283/)

 **Context:** The **destruction of the Kakhovka Dam in Ukraine** is a fast-moving disaster, developing into a long-term environmental catastrophe (termed as **ecocide**) and worsening the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict.

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/kakho.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/kakho.png)

**The Kakhovka Dam:**

- It was built in **1956 (under the Soviet Union) on the Dnipro River in Ukraine** (Kherson region) as part of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant.
- The reservoir of the dam supplies water to the **Crimean peninsula** (annexed by Russia in 2014) and **Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant** (Europe’s largest and also under Russian control).
- There are different **theories behind the collapse of the dam** – **Ukraine blames Russia/** Russia blames Ukraine/for collapse due to earlier damage.

**Impact of the collapse:** 

- **Floods and destruction:** The left bank of the Dnipro River remains under Ukrainian control, while the right side is controlled by the Russians.
- **Agriculture and global food security:** Often called the “**bread basket**” of the world, **64% of Ukraine’s wheat** is exported to developing countries. The flooding is likely to make **arable lands unfit for agriculture** for years to come due to increased salinity in the soil, as well as **contamination of irrigation canals**.
- **Energy security:** Ukraine relies on its **four nuclear power plants**, considered to be a clean energy source, for over **half of its energy needs**. **The damage to the hydroelectric dam** is also a hit to the renewable energy resources in Ukraine.
- **Fresh water supplies: For example,** water levels in the North Crimea Canal, which brings fresh water from the Dnipro River to the Crimea peninsula, may decrease.

**Use of water as a weapon of war:**

- The use of water as a weapon has a history stretching back to **ancient times and it continues today**.
- **As climate change intensifies water scarcity**, the value of water is likely to increase, thus **incentivising its further use in conflict.**
- **Damage to water infrastructure** can be an **accidental** consequence of war or an **intentional**
- Sometimes, weaponising water serves both **military and political goals.** **For example,**
    - **Israel** has restricted water resources to Palestinians to displace local populations and undermine Palestinian economic development.
    - **The Syrian regime** repeatedly used water shortages against civilians and combatants during the Syrian civil war.
- **Upstream states** can use water as leverage when negotiating (by threatening to cut or reduce the flow of water) with **downstream** states about a wide range of issues. **For example,**
    - **Pakistan (downstream) accused India (upstream)** of waging ‘**fifth-generation warfare**‘ by restricting western rivers (Indus, Chenab, and Jhelum) flow to Pakistan.
    - **India accuses China** of controlling the flow of water in **the Brahmaputra River** by building ‘super’ dams close to the Line of Actual Control (LAC).

**Ethical concerns related to the use of water as a weapon of war include:**

- Violation of human rights and denial of access to clean water.
- Environmental damage and ecological consequences.
- Disproportionate impact on vulnerable populations.
- Breach of international humanitarian law.
- Long-term consequences and hindrance to post-conflict recovery.
- Escalation of conflict and perpetuation of violence.

**Way ahead:**

- **The Geneva Conventions** and their Additional Protocols regulate the conduct of armed conflict and seek to limit its effects.
    - Under the additional protocols, **attacks on water infrastructure** such as dams can constitute a **war crime**, particularly if they cause significant harm to civilians.
- The **international community** needs to place greater emphasis on addressing the role of water in conflict.
- However, much depends on how the international community **responds and enforces consequences for such violations.**

**Conclusion:** The tragic results of the Nova Kakhovka dam collapse should bring greater attention to the role that weaponising water is likely to play in the future.

#### **Content for Mains Enrichment (CME)**

**Source:** [**BBC**](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65696083)

**The circular economy** is an economic model that aims to minimize waste and resource consumption by promoting reuse, recycling, and regeneration of materials and products.

**Examples are:**

- **United Repair Centre (URC) (in Amsterdam)** employs refugees as tailors to repair clothing, contributing to sustainability and prolonging garment lifespans.
- **Start-up Madaster (in Amsterdam)** created an online registry to track materials used in buildings, promoting reuse and reducing waste in the construction industry.
- **Clothes Box Foundation**: It is a not-for-profit organization that bestows clothes to less fortunate individuals.
- **Binbag Recycling:** It leverages technology to collect and recycle e-waste in formal channels.

**Usage**: The example can be cited in Environment questions to highlight the circular economy.

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**ohchr**](https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/vienna-declaration-and-programme-action)

 **Context:** This year marks the 30th anniversary of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action

**About the convention:**

The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action (VDPA) is a **human rights declaration** adopted by consensus at the **World Conference on Human Rights on 25 June 1993 in Vienna, Austria.**

**Main features of declaration:**

- It affirmed the **universality, indivisibility and interdependency of human rights**.
- **Vienna’s Right of self-determination to freely** determine their political status, and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development
- Fight against impunity, including the establishment of the International Criminal Court (ICC).

**Action Plan:**

- **The position of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights**was recommended by this Declaration and subsequently created by General Assembly
- World Conference on Human Rights recommended that **each State consider the desirability of drawing up a national action plan** for the protection of human rights
- **United Nations Human Rights Council**holds regular debates (under its agenda item 8) on follow-up

The declaration reaffirms the principles of the **Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) of 1948.** Throughout 2023, UN Human Rights is celebrating the **Human Rights 75** initiative to nudge countries to fulfil the promises of the Universal Declaration.

**About UDHR (1948):**

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), adopted in 1948, sets out a **common standard of human rights for people worldwide**, regardless of their nationality, race, religion, or other status. It consists of two treaties i.e. International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) adopted in 1966. Together with UDHR, ICCPR and ICESCR comprise the International Bill of Human Rights.

**India has ratified both ICCPR and ICESCR**.

**Note**: Don’t confuse this with Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations

### [IBBI to form ‘common panel’ of insolvency professional](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/15/ibbi-to-form-common-panel-of-insolvency-professional/)

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**Economic Times**](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/ibbi-to-form-common-panel-of-insolvency-professionals/articleshow/100974639.cms)

 **Context:** The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) **will create a “common panel” consisting of registered insolvency professionals (IPs).**

- This list will be **shared in advance with the adjudicating authority.**
- For appointment as **IRP (interim resolution professional), Liquidator, RP (resolution professional) and BT (bankruptcy trustee).**

The **purpose of this panel is to allow the authority to choose IPs from the list to oversee various cases of resolution or liquidation.**

Previously, the IBBI could only recommend an IP’s name after receiving a reference from the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in a corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP). This new measure **aims to streamline the selection process and improve efficiency in handling insolvency cases.**

### [Super-engineered vaccines created to help end polio](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/15/super-engineered-vaccines-created-to-help-end-polio/)

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**BBC**](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-65860202)

 **Context:** Scientists have **“super-engineered” polio vaccines** to **prevent them from mutating** into a dangerous form that can cause outbreaks and paralysis.

- The **wild poliovirus** is currently limited to **small pockets in Afghanistan and Pakistan**, and oral vaccines play **a crucial role in eradicating polio worldwide**.
- However, the **oral vaccine has genetic instability**, with just one mutation capable of reversing its safety and causing paralysis. **Vaccine-derived polio cases now outnumber wild poliovirus cases**.

**What are Vaccine-derived polio cases**:

These are instances where the poliovirus in the **oral polio vaccine (OPV) mutates and causes paralysis** in vaccinated individuals or spreads to others in the community. These cases occur when the weakened virus in the vaccine reverts to a form that can cause disease.

To address this, researchers have **genetically modified the weakened virus**, making it more resistant to causing paralysis. The modified vaccines **have shown promising results in human trials, providing more stability and addressing the instability concern (leading to Vaccine-derived polio cases.**

 However, challenges **remain in achieving full coverage and delivering vaccines to impoverished and conflict-affected areas**.

**About Polio:**

Poliomyelitis, also known as polio, is an infection **caused by a virus (poliovirus**). It is a serious, highly contagious disease **that can affect a person’s nervous system.**

There are three types of **wild poliovirus**:

- **WPV 1: still exists but efforts are going on to eradicate it.**
- **WPV 2: eradicated.**
- **WPV 3: eradicated.**

Polio typically **affects children aged 5 years or younger**. It can result in **muscle weakness, permanent disability, and even death.**

**Context: Leptospirosis** is a dangerous infectious disease that has **become significant worldwide, especially during monsoon season**.

- It is caused by the **bacterium Leptospira interrogans** and is primarily **transmitted to humans through contact with the urine of infected animals.**

The disease is **more prevalent in warm, humid countries and is often associated with heavy rainfall or flooding**. Leptospirosis can range from **mild flu-like symptoms to severe organ dysfunction**, and it is estimated to **affect around 1.03 million people annually, resulting in approximately 60,000 deaths.**

Leptospirosis is often **misdiagnosed due to its symptoms resembling those of dengue, malaria, and hepatitis**. Limited access to **reliable diagnostics, lack of awareness among physicians, and insufficient environmental surveillance further contribute to inaccurate reporting of cases.**

**Prevention:**

- Preventing leptospirosis requires effective **health education, community empowerment, and the adoption of preventive measures**. Although commonly referred to as **“rat fever,” leptospirosis can be transmitted by various animals, and seasonal patterns and extreme weather events exacerbate its incidence.**
- **Proper waste management, improved sanitation facilities, and control of stray animals** is crucial in preventing the disease.
