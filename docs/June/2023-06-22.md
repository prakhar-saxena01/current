### [Punjab Police (Amendment) Bill, 2023](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/22/punjab-police-amendment-bill-2023/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: Governance: Appointment process**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/punjab-vidhan-sabha-passes-bill-that-empowers-state-govt-to-ap-8676325point-dgp/#:~:text=to%20appoint%20DGP-,The%20Aam%20Aadmi%20Party%20(AAP)%20government%20in%20Punjab%20Tuesday%20passed,DGP%20of%20its%20own%20choice.)

 **Context:** The Punjab Vidhan Sabha, under the AAP government, has passed the Punjab **Police (Amendment) Bill, 2023**.

- This bill aims to **amend and replace certain clauses** in **The Punjab Police Act, 2007**, regarding the appointment of the state Director General of Police (DGP).

**Major features of the Act:**

- The bill will grant the **state government the authority to appoint a DGP of its choice**.
- The bill proposes the formation of a **seven-member Empanelment Committee** by the Punjab government.
- The committee will **select three senior-most officers** from the pool of eligible officers based on their length of service, record, and experience to lead the police force.
- The provisions of the **bill will prevail over any court judgments, orders, or decrees**.

**Issues with the Bill:**

As per the guidelines laid down by the **Supreme Court in the former DGP Prakash Singh case (2006)** on police reforms, the state government is supposed to **send a panel of eligible officers to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC)**. UPSC then shortlists **three officers from the panel** and the state government would select an officer of its choice among those three.

In 2018, the Supreme Court ordered that **any rule or law that goes against the guidelines** should not be enforced. Therefore, the current bill goes against the Supreme Court’s direction and contradicts it.

**Punjab Government’s argument for the bill**:

- **“Public order” and “Police”** fall under the state’s jurisdiction, as per the **seventh schedule** of the Constitution of India.
- **A proper mechanism for the selection, appointment, and removal** of the DGP is necessary, considering the specific challenges faced by Punjab as a border state.

**Conclusion:**

Punjab has witnessed **recent violent incidents involving Sikh separatists** and a deteriorating law and order situation. However, this should **not be used as a justification to disregard the Supreme Court’s directive**. It is important to strike a balance between the state’s authority in appointing bureaucrats and ensuring adherence to legal and constitutional procedures.

### [Significance of India’s jet engine deal with the US](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/22/significance-of-indias-jet-engine-deal-with-the-us/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Bilateral Agreements involving India and/or affecting India’s interests**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/explained-the-significance-of-indias-jet-engine-deal-with-us/article66992492.ece)

 **Context:** A mega defence deal for the manufacture of fighter jet engines in India is expected to dominate the agenda of the Indian PM’s ongoing official State Visit to the US.

**About the deal:**

- It will allow American manufacturing company **General Electric (GE) Aerospace** to share critical technology with **Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL)**.
- This will help in the **joint production of GE-F414 jet engines** that will power indigenous Light Combat Aircraft **(LCA) Tejas Mk-II.**
- According to media reports, the U.S. has agreed to transfer **~80% of the tech value to India**, which is unprecedented.

**Need for the deal:**

- **India has seen substantial accomplishments** in various defence and space programmes and has also designed and built a fighter jet – LCA Tejas.
- However, India hasn’t achieved much success in producing engines to power these aircraft.

**India’s quest for indigenous aero-engines:**

- **The quest began in the 1960s** with the country’s first indigenous fighter, **HF-24 Marut** – a supersonic jet, which failed to achieve its potential for want of a suitable engine.
- **The Kaveri programme** developed an indigenous military gas turbine engine for the ambitious LCA project in **1986**.
    - The programme incurred an expenditure of over ₹2,000 crore, however, it **failed to meet the necessary technical requirements.**
- With Kaveri still a work in progress, **India shortlisted American GE-F404 engines for LCA Tejas Mark-1** as an interim measure.
- **In 2010**, the Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) selected the more powerful F414 engines to power Tejas Mark-2. The deal did not materialise due to **US domestic legislation and regulatory hindrances.**

**What led to the finalisation of the recent deal?**

- With an eye on China, **the U.S. recognised India as a major defence partner in 2016**, which paved the way for sharing of critical military equipment and technology.
- It sought to put India **on par with NATO member countries.**
- **A new framework to strengthen strategic technology partnerships** put the focus back on the GE-HAL deal at the inaugural meeting of the Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies (**iCET**).

**What are the features of the F414 engine?**

- **It is a fully digital electronic system** to control different aspects of the engine, known as the Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC).
- **It is added with single-engine safety features** customised to meet the country’s defence requirements.
- The engines power several advanced, **next-generation combat aircraft** (Boeing’s F-18 Super Hornet and Saab’s JAS 39-Gripen) around the globe.
- India will become the **5th country** in the world to produce jet engines once the deal is sealed, joining the U.S., Russia, France and the U.K.

**Significance of the deal for India:**

- **Challenges faced by India:** Dual-threat along its borders and maintaining strategic autonomy in the emerging world order.
    - Therefore, **self-reliance and technological transformation** in the defence sector is the necessity for India.
- **The proposed deal –**
    - Will be a **significant step for bilateral defence** and high-tech cooperation **amid China’s growing influence and global technological dominance**.
    - **Will boost India’s military capabilities** at the time of the **Russia-Ukraine conflict.**
    - Will help replace the **fleet of ageing Russian fighters** with indigenously produced fighters.
    - **Will save decades of research and development costs.**
    - Overall, it will have a **transformative impact on the aerospace and defence manufacturing industry**.

**Conclusion:** The deal may elevate the U.S. as an alternative to India’s traditional dependence on Russian hardware, particularly amid rising concerns about Russia’s strategic embrace of China.

### [Draft livestock and livestock products Bill](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/22/draft-livestock-and-livestock-products-bill/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Government Policies and Interventions for Development in various sectors and Issues arising out of their Design and Implementation**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/why-the-draft-live-stock-and-live-stock-product-bill-was-withdrawn-8677983/)

 **Context:** The Centre has withdrawn the proposed draft of the Live-stock and Live-stock Product (Importation and Exportation) Bill, 2023.

**About the new Bill:**

- The Bill is meant to replace the Live-stock Importation Act 1898 and the Live-stock (Amendment) Act 2001.
- It was prepared by the **Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying (DAHD)**, Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Salient provisions**|   |   |
|**The Live-stock Importation Act 1898**|**The Live-Stock Importation (Amendment) Act 2001**|**The new Bill**|
|It regulates only the importation of livestock.|**It led to the inclusion of the import of livestock products** (meat and meat products).|It allows the export of live animals.|
|It also empowered the Centre to **regulate, restrict or prohibit** the trade of any live-stock product that may be liable to affect human or animal health.|It widens the scope of animal import-export (including cats and dogs among ‘live-stock’).|
|It has expanded the definition of livestock to include felines and canines also.|
|It takes away some powers of state governments to regulate this area.|

**Need for a new law:**

- **The present law is 125 years old.**
- Hence, a need has been felt **to align it with the contemporary requirements** and prevailing circumstances related to –
    - Sanitary and phytosanitary measures, and
    - Its extant Allocation of Business Rules 1961

**Criticism of the draft Bill:**

- **Animal rights organisations** have said that the draft Bill will open a **“Pandora’s Box”** of cruelties on animals.
- **Allowing the live export of animals from India** is a free pass for the abuse of millions of animals farmed for food and other uses.

**Govt’s response:** Facing criticism, the Centre has withdrawn the draft Bill.

**Conclusion:** The issue involves sensitivity and emotions with animal welfare and related aspects, and, hence, would need wider consultation.

 **Context:** A Mesolithic period rock painting depicting a person tilling a piece of land has been found in Orvakallu village in Guntur district, Andhra Pradesh.

**Prehistoric rock paintings:**

- The term **‘Prehistory’** refers to the distant past when there was no paper or language, and hence **painting and drawing were the oldest art forms practised by human beings** to express themselves, **using the cave walls as their canvas**.
- The first discovery of rock paintings was made in India in **1867–68** by an archaeologist, **Archibold Carlleyle**, twelve years before the discovery of Altamira in Spain.

**Context:** The Union Ministry of Culture expressed its intent to change the process of nomination for the prestigious Sahitya Akademi Award.

**The Sahitya Akademi Awards:**

- **These are bestowed annually** **by the Sahitya Akademi** – India’s National Academy of Letters, on writers of the most outstanding books of literary merit published in
    - Any of the **22 languages** of the 8th Schedule to the Indian constitution
    - As well as in **English and Rajasthani**
- **With four awards for each language**, the Akademi plays **a crucial role in recognising excellence in literature**.

**The selection process:**

- **For the main award/ Bhasha Samman** conducted through a rigorous and confidential process overseen by experts – the body comprises one writer chosen from **each of the 24 regional languages.**

### [Star Rating Registration Process](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/22/star-rating-registration-process/)

**Source:** [**PIB**](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1933999)

 **Context:** The Ministry of Coal has announced the start of the **Star Rating Registration process** for **Coal and Lignite Mines** for the fiscal year 2022-23.

**Aim**: It aims to **promote competitiveness and sustainable mining** by evaluating mines based on key parameters such as mining operations, environmental impact, technology adoption, economic performance, and worker compliance.

**Process**:  Participating mines will undergo a **self-evaluation process**, and the top 10% performing mines will be further validated through inspections. The evaluation will be conducted by the **Coal Controller’s Organization.** The ratings awarded range from **Five Star to NO Star**, comprehensively evaluating each mine’s achievements.

**Significance:** The initiative seeks to enhance the overall performance and sustainability of coal and lignite mining in the country by recognizing and promoting responsible mining practices.

**About Coal and Lignite:** 

Coal is a solid, carbon-rich mineral formed from plant remains, while lignite is a lower-grade, brownish-black coal. Both fuels are abundant and widely used for their energy content. However, they also contribute to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) imposed a **penalty of ₹591 crores on Coal India** Ltd (CIL), a public sector undertaking, for unfair and discriminatory conditions in fuel supply agreements with power producers. CIL was found to be **supplying lower-quality coal at higher prices and imposing opaque** conditions in the contracts. Previously, Supreme Court ruled that **CIL cannot be exempted from the Competition Act**, emphasizing the need for fair competition and non-discrimination. The judgment reaffirms the principle of **competitive neutrality**, applying **antitrust laws equally** to public and private sector enterprises.

 **Context**: China has **blocked a proposal at the United Nations** to designate Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) **terrorist Sajid Mir as a global terrorist**.

The proposal, moved by the **U.S. and co-designated by India**, aimed to blacklist Mir for his involvement in the **26/11 Mumbai terror attacks**. China had previously put a hold on the proposal in September last year and has now blocked it altogether.

The proposal was under the **al-Qaeda Sanctions Committee of the UN Security Council.** UN Security Council had adopted **Resolution 1267**, which imposed sanctions against the Taliban for providing **sanctuary and training for terrorists**, including Osama bin Laden. Sanction by the committee includes, **assets freeze, travel ban, and arms embargo.**

**About Mir**

He is considered **one of India’s most wanted terrorists and has a $5 million bounty** on his head.

 **Context:** The Ministry of Women and Child Development in **India has decided to integrate the women’s helpline and child helpline services** with **the Emergency Response Support System (ERSS-112) as part of the One Nation One Helpline vision**.

**More about the News:**

- The Childline service, which provides emergency outreach services for children in crisis, **will now be accessible by dialling a four-digit toll-free number (1098) that connects to the ERSS-112.**
- The **Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC)** has been entrusted with automating the child helpline (1098) and integrating it with the ERSS-112.
- The **incoming calls to 1098 will be classified into emergency, non-emergency, and information calls,** with emergency calls being forwarded to the ERSS-112.

**Issues with the current service:**

Previously, the Childline service was supported by **the Child Protection Services (CPS) scheme** through the **Childline India Foundation (CIF) and its partner NGOs**. However, the current system **lacked interoperability with other emergency services**, **causing delays in responding to distress calls**. Additionally, some districts were left uncovered by the **Childline service.**

**Significance:**

By integrating the child helpline with the ERSS-112, the government aims to **improve the administration’s responsiveness and ensure seamless information flow** for the repatriation and restoration of vulnerable children within and across districts and states.

### [Minimum Dietary Diversity (MDD)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/22/minimum-dietary-diversity-mdd/)

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/health/dietary-diversity-can-help-stamp-out-child-malnutrition-in-india-90180)

 **Context**: Inadequate **dietary diversity and meal frequency** contribute to **child malnutrition** in India, including **stunting and micronutrient deficiencies**.

**What is Minimum Dietary Diversity?**

Minimum Dietary Diversity (MDD) refers to a **recommended standard set by the World Health Organization (WHO) for children aged 6-23 months.** It suggests that during the previous **day or within 24 hours**, children should consume foods and beverages from **at least five of the eight defined food groups**.

**Aim of the MDD:**

It aims to ensure that **children receive a diverse range of nutrients** to meet their nutritional needs and promote their healthy growth and development.

**Status of MDD:**

India has a significantly **low proportion of children (15 per cent)** who meet MDD, followed by Nepal (34 per cent), which suggests that South Asian countries are trailing behind in terms of MDD

**Need of MDD:**

Poor-quality diets during the **first two years of life** can have long-lasting effects on a child’s health and development. India has **high rates of child malnutrition**, with a low proportion of children meeting the MDD.

**About WHO initiative:**

WHO has developed **guidelines for Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) practices**, with MDD being one of the core indicators. The eight food groups used for the tabulation of this indicator are:

1. Breast milk
2. Grains products
3. Vegetables such as roots, tubers, plantains
4. Pulses (beans, peas, lentils)
5. Nuts, seeds
6. Dairy products (milk, infant formula, yoghurt, cheese)
7. Flesh foods (meat, fish, poultry, organ meats), eggs
8. Vitamin-A-rich fruits and vegetables

**Suggestions:**

Breast milk alone is **not sufficient after 6-8 months**, and complementary solid or semi-solid foods are necessary. **Socioeconomic factors and maternal education** play a significant role in MDD inequalities. National programs like the **POSHAN Abhiyaan** need to be strengthened further. Relying solely on **supplements and fortification** may not be enough.

**Context**: A new study suggests that the Arctic Ocean could be ice-free in summer by the 2030s, even with efforts to reduce emissions.

**What is the Blue Ocean Event?**

A “blue ocean event” refers to a situation in which the **Arctic Ocean becomes ice-free during the summer,** with the sea ice area dropping **below 1 million square kilometres**. It signifies the absence of sea ice at the top of the world and is considered a significant and alarming consequence of climate change.

The event represents a **critical tipping point in the Arctic system**, as more sea ice melts, it reduces the amount of sunlight reflected into space, leading to further warming and ice loss.
