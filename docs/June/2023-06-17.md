### [Gender Social Norms Index (GSNI)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/17/gender-social-norms-index-gsni/)

#### **GS Paper 1**

 **Syllabus:** **Role of Women**

**Source:** [**UNDP**](https://hdr.undp.org/system/files/documents/hdp-document/gsni202303pdf.pdf)

 **Context:** The **UNDP’s Gender Social Norms Index (GSNI) 2023** has revealed no improvement in biases against women in a decade, with almost 9 out of 10 men and women worldwide still holding such biases.

**What is the GSNI?**

- First introduced in the **2019** Human Development Report, GSNI provides an in-depth account of the **root causes of gender inequality** that hinder progress for women and girls.
- **It covers 4 key dimensions** – political, educational, economic and physical integrity – to highlight areas where women and girls face systematic disadvantages and discrimination.

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/index.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/index.png)

**Highlights of the GSNI 2023:**

- Half of people worldwide still believe **men make better political leaders than women.**
- Over 40% believe **men make better business executives** than women.
- A staggering 25% of people believe it is justified for a man to beat his wife.
- The share of women as heads of state or heads of government **has remained around 10%** since 1995.
- In the labour market, **women occupy less than a third of managerial positions**.
- **A broken link** between women’s progress in education and economic empowerment.
    - **For example**, women are more skilled and educated than ever before, yet the average gender income gap remains a **staggering 39% in favour of men**.

**Impact of these biases:**

- **Drive hurdles faced by women** manifested in a dismantling of women’s rights, and a surge of human rights violations.
- As a result, movements against gender equality are gaining traction in many parts of the world.
- **Severe underrepresentation** of women in leadership.

**Way ahead:**

- Governments have a crucial role in **shifting gender social norms**. **For instance,**
    - **Parental leave** policies have changed perceptions around care work responsibilities, and
    - **Labour market reforms** led to a change in beliefs around the employment of women.
- Directly addressing social norms through **education to change people’s views** and more representation of women in decision-making and political processes.
- An important place to start is **recognising the economic value of unpaid care work**, as women **spend over six times** as much time as men on unpaid care work.
- The focus needs to be on expanding human development through –
    - **Investment** in laws and policy measures that promote women’s equality in political participation.
    - **Insurance** such as strengthening social protection and care systems.
    - **Innovation,** for example, combating online hate speech and gender disinformation can help to shift pervasive gender norms towards greater acceptance and equality.

**Conclusion:**

Gender bias is a pervasive problem worldwide. Therefore, without tackling biased gender social norms, gender equality as reflected in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) can’t be achieved.

- Both sides have engaged in multiple rounds of negotiations and have managed to **disengage at five “friction points**” **along the Line of Actual Control**, establishing demilitarized buffer zones in those areas.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Areas of Cooperation**|**Description**|
|**Political and Diplomatic relations**|Exchange of views and establishment of friendship groups between China and India.|

|**Chinese Initiatives**|India’s concerns and suspicions regarding Chinese initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and Chinese presence in the Indian Ocean.|
|**Increasing presence in the Indian Ocean**|China’s policy of building ports and naval bases in countries surrounding India’s maritime reaches, which India sees as encirclement.|
|**Border Dispute**|Disputed border areas between India and China, including the Western, Middle, and Eastern sectors.|
|**River Water Dispute**|China’s construction of dams in the upper reaches of the Brahmaputra River leads to concerns over water sharing.|

**Conclusion:**

Despite ongoing engagement between the two sides, there is a fundamental difference in their perspectives on the border issue. India insists that the **border situation must be resolved before normalization of bilateral relations can occur,** while **China believes that the issues have been resolved and suggests moving forward.**

 **Context: Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC**) released the National Time Release Study (NTRS) 2023 report.

**About National Time Release Study:**

- The Time Release Study (TRS) is a **performance measurement tool that quantifies the time taken for cargo release at customs stations**. It measures the **duration from cargo arrival to its out-of-charge for domestic clearance** in imports and from cargo arrival to carrier departure in exports.
- The study covers **seaports, air cargo complexes (ACCs), inland container depots (ICDs), and integrated check posts (ICPs),** which handle a significant proportion of entry and shipping bills in the country.

**Key findings:**

- The findings highlight the **importance of the “Path to Promptness” strategy**, which **includes advance filing of import documents, risk-based facilitation, and benefits for trusted clients**. Cargoes that incorporate all three features achieve the **National Trade Facilitation Action Plan release time target across all port categories.**
- In line with the government’s focus on export promotion, **NTRS 2023 places greater emphasis on measuring export release time**.
- The report differentiates between **regulatory clearance (customs release) and physical clearance (completion of logistics processes).** The study indicates that the National Trade Facilitation Action Plan release time target **has been achieved for most port categories when considering regulatory clearance.**

### [Trade Receivables Discounting System (TReDS) platforms](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/17/trade-receivables-discounting-system-treds-platforms/)

**Source:** [**HBL**](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/money-and-banking/govt-rbi-looking-to-integrate-gstn-with-treds-via-account-aggregator/article66973064.ece)

 **Context:** The Indian government and the **Reserve Bank of India (RBI)** are exploring the integration of the Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) with the Trade Receivables Discounting System (TReDS) platforms using an **account aggregator**.

**What is the Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN)?**

The Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) is a technology platform established by the Indian government to manage the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) system. It serves as a backbone for the GST regime, facilitating taxpayer registration, invoice filing, tax payment, and return filing processes.

**What are Trade Receivables Discounting System (TReDS) platforms?**

Trade Receivables Discounting System (TReDS) platforms are **digital platforms that provide a mechanism for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)** to raise funds by selling their trade receivables or invoices to financiers at a discounted rate. These platforms facilitate the early realization of funds, helping SMEs improve their cash flow and working capital.

**What is an account aggregator?**

An account aggregator is a financial intermediary that collects and consolidates a user’s financial data from various sources such as banks, mutual funds, insurance companies, and other financial institutions.

**Account Aggregator Network (AAN)** is an RBI-regulated entity (with an NBFC-AA license) Currently, **23 banks from both public and private** are under the AAN. AA framework was created in **2021 through an inter-regulatory decision** by RBI and other regulators including **SEBI, IRDA, and PFRDA** through an initiative of the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC)

**How does the integration of GSTN with TReDS help?**

- It **facilitates direct sanctions of invoices** raised by Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) on the GSTN platform.
- By integrating the two systems, **e-invoices generated on the GSTN** can be seamlessly transmitted to the TReDS portal, eliminating the need for additional activities or documentation.
- This will lead to **faster loan underwriting and sanctions** as financiers will have greater confidence in the authenticity of the invoices sourced directly from the GST platform.
- Development of an **alternative credit database**, particularly benefiting MSMEs with limited credit history.

### [Global Fund for Recycling Lithium-ion Batteries](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/17/global-fund-for-recycling-lithium-ion-batteries/)

**Source:** [**HBL**](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/g20-policy-paper-moots-global-fund-for-ev-battery-mineral-recycling-capacity/article66972186.ece)

**Context**: A policy brief for the G20 suggests establishing a global fund to invest in increasing recycling capacities for lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles (EVs).

**Need:**

- There is **a rising demand** for minerals like Lithium, Cobalt, Nickel, and Graphite.
- Existing battery waste materials have significant potential and can generate a value of around **$4,800-5,200 per tonne**.
- **Safe and environmentally beneficial recycling**
- **Battery recycling is at a nascent stage** with gaps concerning technology in reducing recycling costs and improving material recovery capacity.

**Lithium-ion battery recycling technologies:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Technologies**|**Description**|
|**Mechanical Separation**|This technology involves the **physical separation of lithium-ion battery components** through mechanical processes such as shredding and sieving.|
|**Pyrometallurgical Process**|It is a **high-temperature process that uses heat to melt and separate battery components**, recovering valuable metals like lithium, cobalt, etc.|
|**Hydrometallurgical Process**|In this process, **lithium-ion batteries are dissolved in a liquid solution, and chemical reactions** are used to separate and recover valuable metals.|
|**Lithium Recovery from Electrolyte**|This specific process targets the **recovery of lithium** from the electrolyte of lithium-ion batteries, which can then be reused or processed further.|
|**Biological Process**|This emerging technology involves the use of **biological agents or microorganisms** to extract and recover valuable materials from lithium-ion batteries.|

**India’s steps**:

- **Battery waste management Act 2022** confers the **Producers (including importers) the obligation of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)** for the battery that they introduce in the market to ensure its collection and recycling.

### [Lab-grown human embryo models](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/17/lab-grown-human-embryo-models/)

**Source:** [**Nature**](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01992-0)

**Context**: Recently, scientists have **successfully created advanced embryo-like structures** using human stem cells. These synthetic embryos **develop similarly to natural embryos at around 14 days after fertilization.**

- This breakthrough allows **researchers unprecedented opportunities to study human embryonic development at later stages**. However, it also raises ethical and legal questions regarding the regulation and status of these **“embryo models.”**
- The ability to study embryo models beyond 14 days is significant **because it allows researchers to explore developmental defects and pregnancy loss**, which are **challenging to study using animal models.**

**Controversy:**

- The scientific controversy surrounding this research arises from **the highly competitive race to develop embryo models at later stages**.
- Ethical concerns have also emerged **regarding the status and regulation of human embryo models.** While these models are not subject to the 14-day rule applied to natural embryos**, guidelines and regulations related to the use of human embryonic stem cells must be followed**.
