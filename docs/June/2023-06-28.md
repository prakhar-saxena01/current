### [Sedition Law in India](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/28/sedition-law-in-india-2/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** Issues Arising Out of Design & Implementation of Policies, Government Policies & Interventions

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/situation-from-kashmir-to-kerala-makes-it-must-to-retain-sedition-law-law-panel-chief/article67015499.ece#:~:text=Amid%20a%20clamour%20for%20repeal,unity%20and%20integrity%20of%20India%22.)

 **Context:** The Law Commission Chairman, **Justice Ritu Raj Awasthi, argues that retaining the sedition law is necessary to safeguard the unity and integrity of India**, citing the current situation in various regions.

- Recently, the **279th report** of the **Law Commission of India** has recommended the retention of the 153-year-old colonial law on sedition in India.

**What is Sedition?**

According to the **Section 124A of IPC**, Sedition is an act that brings or attempts to bring into hatred or contempt, or excites or attempts to excite disaffection **towards the Government** established by law in India by words, either spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible representation, or otherwise.

**History**:

- Drafted by **TB Macaulay** and included in the IPC in 1870, C**olonial administrators** used sedition to lock up people who criticised the British policies.
- **Lokmanya Tilak, Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Bhagat Singh, etc.,** were convicted for their “seditious” speeches, writings and activities under British rule.

**Views by Supreme Court:**

- **In 1962,** the Supreme Court decided on the constitutionality of Section 124A in **Kedar Nath Singh v State of Bihar.**
    - It upheld the constitutionality of sedition, but limited its application to “**acts involving intention or tendency to create disorder, or disturbance of law and order, or incitement to violence”.**
    - It distinguished these from “very strong speech” or the use of “vigorous words” strongly critical of the government.
- In **1995**, the Supreme Court, in **Balwant Singh v State of Punjab**, held that mere sloganeering which evoked no public response did not amount to sedition.
- **SC (in** **July 2021):** The court ruled that “**a statute criminalizing expression based on unconstitutionally vague definitions of ‘disaffection towards Government’** is an unreasonable restriction on the fundamental right to free expression guaranteed under Article 19 (1)(a) and causes constitutionally impermissible **‘Chilling Effect’ on speech”.**
- **In 2022, the SC effectively put on hold the colonial-era penal provision** and asked the Centre/states to desist from arresting/prosecuting people under the contentious provision.

**Sedition law is relevant for India:**

- **Threats to the unity and integrity** of the nation due to the presence of anti-national elements and divisive Forces such as naxals, terrorists and separatists who are receiving support from inside and outside the country.
- **Mere misuse cannot be a ground for repeal**, rather provisions should be made where such misuse is eliminated.
- **No other law covers sedition: S**pecial laws such as the **Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and the National Security Act** operate in different fields and do not cover the offence of sedition and therefore, the specific law on sedition is therefore needed.
- **Not really a draconian law:** Now after the Supreme Court’s directions, its jurisdiction has been narrowed down. It can be applied only on grounds laid down by the court.
- **Application is a part of reasonable restrictions:** It is provided under Article 19 (2).
- **Does not really curb free speech:** One can use any kind of strong language in criticism of the government without inviting sedition. However, such dissent should not be turned into some kind of persuasion to break the country.
- Jurisdictions like the **US, Canada, Australia, UK, etc.,** have actually merged their sedition law with **counter-terror legislation.**

**Issues with the Sedition Law in India:**

- **Against democratic norms:** It stifles the democratic and **fundamental right (Article 19(1)(a))** of people to criticize the government. It leads to a sort of **unauthorised self-censorship**, for it produces a chilling effect on free speech.
    - It suppresses what every citizen ought to do in a democracy — raise questions, debate, disagree and challenge the government’s decisions.
    - Sedition systematically destroys the soul of **Gandhi’s philosophy** that is, the **right to dissent.**
- **Inadequate capacity of State Machinery:** The police might not have the “requisite” training to understand the consequences of imposing such a “stringent” provision.
- **Possibility of Misuse:** It has been used arbitrarily to curb dissent. In many cases, the main targets have been writers, journalists, activists who question government policy and projects, and political dissenters. E.g. **Vinod Dua v Union of India**
- **Low conviction:** Charge sheets were filed only in a tiny percentage of cases and not more than a handful ended in convictions upheld by the higher courts.
- **Strong deterrent effect on dissent:** The draconian nature of this law as the crime is non-bailable, non-cognisable and punishment can extend for life—it has a strong deterrent effect on dissent even if it is not used.
- **Used to gag press:** The press should be protected so that it could bare the secrets of the government and inform the people. Only a free and unrestrained press can effectively expose deception in government.

**Safeguards recommended by the Law Commission:**

- **The preliminary inquiry** will be held by a police officer of the **rank of inspector or above**.
- The inquiry will be **done within seven days from the occurrence** of the incident
- The preliminary inquiry report will be submitted to the competent government authority for **permission for lodging of FIR**
- **On the basis of the preliminary report**, if the competent government authority finds any cogent evidence with regard to the commissioning of the offence of sedition, it may grant permission to lodge an FIR under Section 124 A of the IPC

 **Recent examples of misuse of Sedition law**

 In February 2021, the Supreme Court protected a **political leader and six senior journalists from arrest in sedition cases** related to their tweets and sharing unverified news. In June 2021, the court also emphasized the **need to define the limits of sedition** while protecting **two Telugu news channels from coercive action** by the Andhra Pradesh government. Recently, human rights activists in the northeast have raised concern over the misuse of Sedition law to curb protests in Mizoram.

**Conclusion**

The guidelines of the SC must be incorporated in Section 124A as well by amendment to IPC so that any ambiguity must be removed. Only those actions/words that directly result in the use of violence or incitement to violence should be termed seditious.

### [Reforming Multilateral Development Banks](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/28/reforming-multilateral-development-banks/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Important International Institutions, agencies and fora – their Structure, Mandate**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/indias-g20-presidency-multilateral-development-banks-pm-modi-us-visit-8687542/)

 **Context:** In his address to the US Congress, the Indian PM talked about the relevance of Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) and the need to reform them.

**The emergence of MDBs:**

- **At the end of WWII**, delegates from 44 countries met in Bretton Woods (US) to agree upon a series of new rules for international cooperation and reconstruction.
- This led to the creation of the **IMF and World Bank Group (WBG)** in **1944**.
- The latter was responsible for providing **financial assistance for the post-war reconstruction and economic development** of the less developed countries.
- **While the WBG is the oldest and the largest MDB**, there are ~15-16 prominent MDBs and Regional development banks (RDBs) today.

**Relevance of MDBs:**

- **Credible institutions** to support the development of both MICs and LICs amid far-reaching geopolitical changes, economic crises and uncertainties.
- The two traditional goals shared by all multilateral institutions have been the **elimination of poverty and fostering of shared prosperity.**

**Challenges faced by MDBs:**

- **No longer suited** in terms of the resources, cultural ethos and methods to address the emerging challenges – _global public goods, climate change and pandemics_.
- MDBs are in a state of **stagnation, trapped in their procedures, approach and methods** of work and resistant to structural changes.

**Reforming MDBs:**

- In recent years, the restructuring of MDBs (**to reflect contemporary realities**) has received increasing attention.
- The current debate on the reforms of MDBs is **a subset of the wider debate on the value, content and scope of multilateralism.**
    - **Multilateralism** refers to an alliance of multiple countries pursuing a common goal.
    - It is the **most transparent and preferred mode of international cooperation** and is based on founding principles such as **consultation, inclusion and solidarity.**

**Need to reform MDBs:**

- **To broaden the mandate and vision:** To address the challenges of transboundary issues and the opportunities connected with climate change.
- **To expand the need for finance and the sources of finance:** The WBG estimates that the average annual spending needed to address global challenges of climate change, conflict, and pandemics is $2.4 trillion per year between 2023 and 2030.
- **To mobilise private capital:** The current system has failed to raise sufficient private finance.
    - On the demand side, there are concerns about moral hazards associated with private capital.
    - On the supply side, private capital is not immune to risks – such as those associated with foreign exchange.
- **For India**, reforming MDBs would mean **advocating the voice of the Global South**.

**Way ahead:**

- **Expert Group on Strengthening MDBs:** Under India’s G20 presidency, the Expert Group proposes to submit two reports.
    - The first focuses on issues of vision, financial capacity and modalities of funding the MDBs.
    - The second deals with issues related to **harnessing private capital, risk mitigation, hybrid innovative financing**, etc.
- **Enhancing the lending capacities of multilateral institutions** by optimising their current balance sheets to attract private capital.
- **Creating an incentive structure** and bringing changes to the current operating model of the MDBs.

**Conclusion:**

- Making MDBs more relevant for addressing 21st-century challenges would contribute towards enhancing **human welfare**.
- **Deeper integration with multiple stakeholders is crucial**. If MDBs do not respond to these new challenges, they will become increasingly irrelevant and be substituted by other forms of cooperation.

### [Recent Examples of Ethics](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/28/recent-examples-of-ethics/)

#### **GS Paper 4**

 **Syllabus: Application of Ethics**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-rwas-and-prejudice-pettiness-of-power-8687578/)**,** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/explained-rehana-fathima-case-obscenity-laws-and-the-policing-of-female-sexuality/article66968303.ece)

 **Example 1:** RWA in Bengaluru bars maids and servants from using of common area

The notice issued by the **housing society in Bengaluru**, **barring maids** from using common areas, raises several significant issues:

The housing society said that “It is difficult to see them hang out everywhere in the park, amphitheatre, gazebos. Residents can feel uncomfortable when being surrounded by maids everywhere we walk.”

**Ethical Issues with such notice:**

- **Elitist Attitude**: The notice reflects an **elitist upper-class attitude** towards workers, particularly domestic helpers.
- **Casteism and Class Prejudice**: The notice suggests the presence of casteism and class prejudice within society.
- **Imposition of Will**: The notice illustrates how the Residents Welfare Association (RWA) can exert their power and impose its decisions on marginalized individuals who lack the means to voice their objections.
- **Corruption of Petty Power**: The notice exemplifies how those with limited authority can abuse their position and use it to **enforce discriminatory practices**.

**Example 2: Rehana Fathima Case**

 **Fathima,** a female rights activist, faced multiple charges under various laws for posting a video showing her 14-year-old son painting on her. The video sparked outrage and accusations of obscenity on social media.

**In a recent Kerala High Court Judgment**, the court observed that “The right of a woman to make **autonomous decisions about her body is at the very core of her fundamental right** to equality and privacy. It also falls within the realm of personal liberty guaranteed **by Article 21 of the Constitution.”**

The example emphasizes that **notions of social morality are subjective and vary among individuals and communities.** Actions that may be considered **morally wrong by some may not necessarily be legally wrong,** highlighting the distinction between **morality and criminality.**

**Example 3: Role of Parent in inculcating values:**

In 2023, American President Joe Biden’s son was convicted of tax fraud, and Jackie Chan’s son for drug offences.

**On a positive note**, **R.Madhwan’s son won 5 gold in Asian Swimming competitions**, and Ravi Kishan’s daughter joins the defence service.

These events highlight the **significance of parental influence in shaping a child’s upbringing**, instilling values, and safeguarding them from negative influences.

**Example 4:** [**John B. Goodenough**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/27/john-goodenough-co-creator-of-the-lithium-ion-battery/), co-creator of Lithium Ion Batteries passed away recently. He demonstrated several ethical values through his work and actions:

- **Sharing knowledge:** Goodenough shared his patents and collaborated with other researchers, highlighting his commitment to advancing scientific knowledge and promoting collective progress over personal gain.
- **Philanthropy:** He donated the stipends he received from his awards and scholarships, demonstrating a spirit of generosity.
- **Environmental consciousness**: Goodenough’s work on lithium-ion batteries contributed to the development of clean energy solutions.
- **Integrity and humility:** Despite his significant achievements and recognition, Goodenough remained humble and did not seek personal royalties or fame.
- **Contribution to society**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/specials/text-and-context/the-role-of-organic-intellectuals-in-challenging-capitalist-hegemony/article67011885.ece)

**Organic intellectuals are individuals who come from a particular social class** and have a deep understanding of the economic structure and issues faced by that class. They remain connected to their class and work to raise awareness about the social and political roles of their class members.

- The concept was introduced by **Antonio Gramsci** (Italian Marxist philosopher, journalist, linguist, writer, and politician)

**For example,** let’s **consider a group of factory workers who are fighting for better working conditions and fair wages.** Organic intellectuals in this context could include workers who actively engage with their fellow workers, educate them about their rights, and organize protests or strikes to demand better treatment from their employers.

**Significance**: These organic intellectuals play a crucial role in challenging the existing power structures and working towards positive changes for their class.

**Usage:** The terms can be used in Indian Society, Essay and Sociology optional papers.

- The festival revolves around the **worship of Chaturdasa Devata**, the **ancestral deity of the Tripuri people, and showcases their rich history and traditions.**
- The word ‘Kharchi’ is derived from Tripuri words meaning **‘sin’ and ‘cleaning**,’ signifying the cleansing of sins.

The significance of Kharchi Puja **is linked to the belief that the presiding deity of the land, Tripura Sundari or Mother Goddess**, menstruates during **the Ambubachi period in June**. It is believed that the Earth becomes impure during this time, **so puja is performed to ritually clean the Earth and wash away the sins of the people.**

- **Aadhaar is not mandatory for such registration**.
- The Registrar General of India’s office **can voluntarily authenticate the Aadhaar numbers** collected during the registration process to verify the identity of individuals. State governments and Union Territories **must adhere to MEiTY’s guidelines regarding the use of Aadhaar authentication.**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**What is Aadhaar Authentication (AA)?**|Aadhaar authentication is **a process that verifies the identity of an individual using their Aadhaar number.** It is mainly used for availing government services and schemes.|
|**Entities currently allowed to perform AA**|Government ministries and departments; Some private entities like banks and telecom companies (**for KYC authentication and only if UIDAI was satisfied with regard to standards of privacy and security**).|
|**Purpose of AA**|For the interest of good governance, preventing leakage of public funds, enablement of innovation, the spread of knowledge, and promoting ease of living and enabling better access to services for residents.|
|**Legal provision**|Aadhaar Authentication for **Good Governance (Social Welfare, Innovation, Knowledge) Rules, 2020**|
|**Concerns**|Supreme Court (2018) struck down Section 57 of the Aadhaar Act, which allowed the use of Aadhaar data by private companies, deeming it “**unconstitutional” for establishing the identity of an individual**.|
|**What is the Aadhaar number?**|**A 12-digit unique identity number issued by UIDAI,** a statutory authority under MeitY, on behalf of the Government of India. It is based on an individual’s biometric and demographic data.|

### [Combating Greenwashing](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/28/combating-greenwashing/)

**Source:** [**The Print**](https://theprint.in/world/new-global-rules-aim-to-clamp-down-on-corporate-greenwashing/1642702/)

 **Context:** Global norms aimed at **combating greenwashing** are being introduced, pressuring companies to disclose their business’s impact on climate change.

**What is Greenwashing?**

Greenwashing refers to the deceptive practice of portraying a company, product, or initiative as environmentally friendly or sustainable when it actually lacks substantial environmental benefits or may even be environmentally harmful.

For example, **a clothing brand may advertise its products as “eco-friendly” or “green”** while still using unsustainable manufacturing processes, contributing to pollution, or exploiting labour.

**About the global norms for combating Greenwashing:** 

**International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB),** will set uniform sustainability and climate standards for companies to follow **worldwide from 2024**.

**New standards are:**

- **IFRS S1:** sets out **disclosure requirements designed** to enable companies to communicate to investors about the **sustainability-related risks** and opportunities they face.
- **IFRS S2**: sets out **specific climate-related disclosures** and is designed to be used with IFRS S1.

These norms, published by the ISSB with the **support of the G20**, are intended to assist regulators in cracking down on **misleading environmental, social, and governance (ESG) claims**.

- These are **non-binding and it is up to individual countries** to determine whether listed companies must adhere to these standards.
- It builds upon **voluntary guidelines from the G20’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)**, which have already been **made mandatory for listed companies in Britain**.

**Financial Stability Board (FSB)** created TCFD to improve reporting of climate-related financial information. FSB is an **international body (India is a member)** that monitors and makes recommendations about the **global financial system**.

**About ISSB**

The International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) is a standard-setting body established in 2021–2022 under the **International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation** (a non-profit organisation governing international accounting rules)

**The mandate of ISSB:** Its mandate is the creation and development of **sustainability-related financial reporting standards** to meet investors’ needs for sustainability reporting.

### [Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/28/prokaryotes-and-eukaryotes/)

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/how-prokaryotes-led-to-eukaryotes/article67002928.ece)

 **Context:** The article talks about how more complex organisms called eukaryotes evolved from simpler organisms called prokaryotes.

**The Evolution:**

Long ago, there were simple organisms called prokaryotes. They were **single-celled and didn’t have a nucleus**. But over time, some of these organisms evolved to have **mitochondria and DNA packaged into a nucleus.**

**The mitochondria,** which produce energy in **eukaryotic cells, and chloroplasts** in plant cells, originally came from **free-living bacteria**. This happened when an **ancient Archaea organism engulfed a bacterium**, and over time, they formed a mutually beneficial relationship. This event eventually led to **the development of animals, fungi, and plants**.

This evolution from prokaryotes to eukaryotes happened gradually and involved various changes in their structure and functions.

**Main differences between prokaryotes and eukaryotes:**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
||**Prokaryotes**|**Eukaryotes**|
|**Nucleus**|Absent|Present|
|**DNA**|Circular|Linear|
|**Membrane-bound organelles**|Absent|Present (e.g., mitochondria, chloroplasts)|
|**Size**|Smaller|Larger|
|**Reproduction**|Asexual (mostly)|Sexual and asexual|
|**Examples**|Bacteria and Archaea|Plants, animals, fungi, protists|

### [Democratic Republic of the Congo](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/28/democratic-republic-of-the-congo/)

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/world/congo-world-s-2nd-largest-rainforest-continues-to-vanish-with-half-a-million-hectares-lost-in-2022-says-report-90284)

A new report reveals that the Congo, **the world’s second-largest rainforest**, lost half a million hectares of forest in 2022. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) accounts for **60% of the rainforest** and experiences persistent high rates of primary forest loss.

**Reason**: The DRC has one of the highest population growth rates in the world — 3.19 per cent. The subsequent increase in the demand for food has led to shorter fallow periods and the expansion of agriculture into primary forests.

**The Democratic Republic of the Congo** (Congo-Kinshasa and formerly known as Zaire) is a country in Central Africa. By land area, the DRC is the **second-largest country in Africa,** after Algeria.

It shares borders with several countries, including the Republic of the Congo, Central African Republic, South Sudan, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania (across Lake Tanganyika), Zambia, and Angola, and has a coastline along the South Atlantic Ocean.
