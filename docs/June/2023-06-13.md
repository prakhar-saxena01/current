### [India has a similar geologic history to parts of South Africa, Australia](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/13/india-has-a-similar-geologic-history-to-parts-of-south-africa-australia/)

#### **GS Paper 1**

**Syllabus****: Geography: Geology**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/india-has-similar-geologic-history-to-parts-of-south-africa-australia-study/article66960121.ece)

**Context:** A recent study has revealed that **India hosts remarkably well-preserved volcanic and sedimentary rocks as old as 3.5 billion years**, and has similar geologic history to parts of South Africa and Australia.

- These rocks, found in the **Daitari greenstone belt within the Singhbhum Craton** in east India, provide valuable insights into the geological history of the region and shed light on past Earth processes.
- Cratons are **pieces of ancient continents that formed several billions of years ago.** Their study provides a window into how **processes within and on the surface of Earth operated in the past.**

**Key Findings:**

- The **presence of silicic rocks rich in silica indicated explosive sub-marine to sub-aerial volcanic settings**. Furthermore, the researchers determined that **sub-marine turbidity current deposits, comprising sedimentary rocks, were formed after the volcanic vent drowned.**
- By studying these ancient greenstones, **researchers gain insights into various volcanic processes and uncover well-preserved minor sedimentary rocks** that formed under sub-marine conditions.

**Significance:**

- The well-preserved greenstones **serve as time capsules, providing clues about habitable environments on Earth during its early stages** and **aiding in the comprehension of the planet’s evolution.**
- It provides evidence for various **theories of plate tectonics**

**Various theories of Plate tectonics:**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Theory**|Description|Key Proponents|
|**Continental Drift**|Suggested that continents were once a supercontinent (Pangaea) and have drifted apart over time|Alfred Wegener|
|**Seafloor Spreading**|Proposed that new oceanic crust forms at mid-ocean ridges and spreads outward|Harry Hess|
|**Subduction Theory**|Described the process of one tectonic plate descending beneath another at subduction zones|Charles Darwin, Eduard Suess|
|**Plate Tectonics**|Integrated the concepts of continental drift and seafloor spreading into a comprehensive theory|Tuzo Wilson, Jason Morgan, Dan McKenzie|

**Key evidence in support of plate tectonics:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Evidence**|**Description**|
|**Fit of Continents**|The coastlines of continents, such as the east coast of South America and the west coast of Africa, fit together like puzzle pieces, indicating their past connection.|
|**Fossil Distribution**|Similar fossils of plants and animals are found on different continents, suggesting that they were once joined and have since separated.|
|**Rock and Mountain Belts**|Matching rock types, geological formations, and mountain ranges are found across continents that were once part of the same landmass.|
|**Palaeomagnetism**|The alignment of iron minerals in rocks, recorded by Earth’s magnetic field, shows that the magnetic poles have moved over time and continents have shifted.|
|**Mid-Ocean Ridges**|Underwater mountain ranges with a central rift where new crust forms and moves away, supporting the idea of seafloor spreading and the creation of a new oceanic crust.|
|**Subduction Zones**|Deep ocean trenches where one tectonic plate is forced beneath another, provide evidence of plate convergence and subduction.|
|**Earthquake and Volcanic Activity**|Distribution of earthquakes and volcanoes along plate boundaries, demonstrating the association between plate interactions and geological activity.|

### [Indo-US Cooperation in Agriculture](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/13/indo-us-cooperation-in-agriculture/)

#### **GS Paper 2/ 3**

 **Syllabus****: Bilateral, Regional and Global Groupings and Agreements involving India and affecting India’s interests/ Agriculture and related issues**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/the-lessons-of-indo-us-cooperation-in-agriculture-8657682/)

 **Context:** A brief history of the US role in independent India’s agricultural development is useful in the context of the Indian PM’s upcoming visit to the US, for strengthening the “global strategic partnership” between the two countries.

**Independent India’s agricultural development:**

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/food_scarce.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/food_scarce.png)**

- **Food shortage in pre-independent India**: Agriculture was monsoon-dependent and unfavourable rains and natural calamities resulted in crop failures.
- **The planning process in independent India:** It identified agriculture as the most prioritised sector and emphasised that ‘everything can wait but agriculture’.
- **Increase in the food grain production:** From merely 51 million tons (Mt) in 1950/51 increased over 6 times to over 314 Mt in 2022.
    - The country became the **largest producer** of milk, pulses and jute and the **second-largest producer** of rice, wheat, cotton, fruits and vegetables in the world.

**Role played by the US in India’s agricultural development:**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/strate_agri.jpg?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/strate_agri.jpg)

- **The first Agricultural University:**
    - The UP Agricultural University (later renamed **B. Pant University of Agriculture & Technology**) was inaugurated in 1960.
    - **It is based on the US land-grant model** – which integrated teaching, research and extension.
    - **Thereafter 7 more universities** received the US Agency for International Development’s assistance for the training of faculty and the provision of equipment and books.
- **The Green Revolution’s seeds:**
    - **The US aided** India’s Green Revolution by supplying seeds with a high output when administered with more inputs (nutrients and water).
    - By 1968, India had transformed from a **ship-to-mouth shortage economy to a country that shut down schools and cinema theatres to store surplus food.**
- **Recent cooperation:** The two countries revived the **S.-India Agriculture Dialogue** as well as the **U.S.-India Agricultural Knowledge Initiative (AKI)** to share extensive experience in agricultural research, training, and extension.

**Why does the US help India?**

- **The Cold War geopolitics** **and great-power rivalry** of those times resulted in competition to extend help to those goods that were viewed as “**global public goods**”.
    - India’s strategy of “**non-alignment**” paid off then, just as “multi-alignment” is today.
- **Opportunities for U.S. investors in India’s agri-markets:** Today, the Indian market can provide significant new investment opportunities in cold chain transportation logistics and frozen foods distribution.

**Cooperation with other countries:**

- **India and Israel** are implementing the “INDO-ISRAEL Agricultural Project Centres of Excellence” and “INDO-ISRAEL Villages of Excellence”.
- **India and Vietnam** agreed to strengthen their specific cooperation to develop a **hi-tech agricultural relation in association with environmental protection**.
- **An India-ASEAN Working Group on Agriculture** has been formed, as agriculture is a critical sector for the economy of India as well as the ASEAN Member States.

**Indian agriculture continues to battle several challenges:** Such as increasing productivity against the backdrop of –

- Increasing population,
- Depleting natural resource base,
- Aggravating climate change and
- Reducing farm income.

**Targets that India has prioritised:**

- Doubling farmer’s income,
- Reducing fertiliser use (by 25%) and water use (by 20%),
- Increasing use of renewable energy (50%),
- Reducing GHG emission intensity (45%) and rehabilitating degraded land of 26 million ha (Mha).

**Way forward:**

- **A multi-pronged strategy** with integration, diversification, intensification, customisation, and farm mechanisation, to realise the full potential of Indian farming.
- **Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)** and the **National Agricultural Research, Education and Extension System (NAREES)** are determined –
    - To harness the advances of S&T
    - **To infuse pull and push in agriculture** for the all-around welfare of society.

### [Same-sex marriage: Morality vs equality](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/13/same-sex-marriage-morality-vs-equality/)

#### **GS Paper 4**

 **Syllabus****: Ethics, Integrity and Attitude**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/same-sex-marriage-morality-vs-equality/article66962137.ece)

 **Context:** The issue of same-sex marriage has been taken up by the Supreme Court. This article highlights the ethical issues associated with it.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Argument**|**Supporters of Same-Sex Marriage**|**Opponents of Same-Sex Marriage**|
|**View on Same-Sex Marriage**|Argue for **equal rights and recognition**|Consider it a **threat to traditional values**|
|**Basis of Argument**|**Equality and recognition** of love and commitment|Moral **or religious beliefs**|
|**Perspective on Morality**|Emphasize **fairness and equal treatment**|View Marriage as a **sacred institution – Issues with** Child-Rearing and Parental Roles|
|**Legal Implications**|Advocate for **expanding marriage definition**|Advocate **for maintaining the traditional definition**|

**What should be the role of the state in regulating personal relationships and defining moral norms:**

- Minimal Intervention
- Protecting Individual Rights
- Promoting Public Morality
- Cultural and Democratic Influence

**Global Scenario:**

- In **Australia**, the Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws – General Law Reform) Act 2008 was enacted to provide equal entitlements for same-sex couples in matters of, inter alia, social security, employment and taxation.
- In England and Wales, the **Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 enabled same-sex couples to marry in civil ceremonies or with religious rites.**
- **In 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States decided that the fundamental right to marry is guaranteed to same-sex couples**. It held the denial of marriage rights to same-sex couples to be a grave and continuing harm, serving to disrespect and subordinate gays and lesbians.
- **At least 29 countries**in the world have legalised same-sex marriage.

**Conclusion:**

Ultimately, the **resolution of this debate involves balancing competing values, including equality, individual rights, religious freedom, and societal norms**. It requires careful consideration of the rights and dignity of all individuals involved, while also respecting diverse perspectives on the meaning and purpose of marriage.

**Context**: A recent study has shown that **Taurine – a nutrient found in meat, and fish and sold as a supplement** – extends life and boosts health in a range of animal species.

- Experiments on **middle-aged animals showed boosting taurine to youthful levels extended life by over 10% and improved physical and brain health.**

**About Taurine:**

- Taurine is **an amino acid** that has a few important roles in your body, **including supporting immune health and nervous system function.** 
- The scientific report suggests **taurine plays a role in reducing cellular senescence – where cells in the body stop dividing – a hallmark of ageing.**
- The nutrient also appeared to **keep mitochondria – the power stations in the body’s cells – functioning.**
- Taurine is virtually non-existent in plants. So the nutrient **either comes from the animal protein in the diet or is manufactured by the body.**

**Context**: Reports suggest that the **Islamic State (IS) and Syrian fighters widely consumed Captagon to increase alertness and suppress appetite during their gruelling battles**.

**About Captagon:**

- Captagon is a **highly addictive amphetamine-type drug**, which is **produced mainly in Syria and widely smuggled across West Asia.** Several reports over the years have claimed that sales of the drug, estimated to be worth several billion dollars a year**, have profited al-Assad, his associates and his family.**
- Captagon is a **counterfeit version of medicine with the same brand name that was originally produced in the 1960s** to treat **attention deficit disorders, narcolepsy, and other conditions**.
- The original Captagon contained **fenetylline**, a synthetic drug belonging to the phenethylamine family, including amphetamine. **It was banned in the 1980s due to concerns about its addictive nature**.
- Amphetamine-based drugs like **Captagon stimulate the central nervous system, providing a boost of energy, increased focus, and a feeling of euphoria.** However, they do not confer superhuman abilities. Side effects of these drugs can **include loss of appetite, heart problems, high body temperature, memory loss, and addiction.**

### [Red giant star Betelgeuse](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/13/red-giant-star-betelgeuse/)

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/betelgeuse-red-giant-supernova-study-dispute/article66957274.ece)

 **Context:** Recent research on the massive **red giant star Betelgeuse** suggests that it is in its late carbon-burning stage (near the end of its life) and may explode as a supernova within a few decades.

**Life Cycle of a Star:**

A star is born from a dense cloud of gas and dust **called a nebula**. Through the process of nuclear fusion, it converts hydrogen into helium, releasing energy and emitting light. As the star **exhausts its hydrogen fuel**, it **expands and becomes a red giant**. In this phase, it **fuses helium into heavier elements** like **carbon and oxygen.**

 While smaller stars, like our Sun, eventually shed their outer layers and form a white dwarf. **Larger stars** undergo a **supernova explosion**, where their **cores collapse** and release an **immense amount of energy**. This explosion **disperses heavy elements** **into space** and may result in the formation of a **neutron star or a black hole**.

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/star_1.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/star_1.png)**

**What is a red giant star?**

A [red giant](https://esahubble.org/wordbank/red-giant/) star is a **large, ageing star that has expanded and cooled down**, causing it to appear red in colour. It occurs in the **later stages of a star’s life cycle** when it exhausts its hydrogen fuel and starts burning heavier elements.

**About Betelgeuse**

It is a **red giant star** **located** in the constellation **Orion**. It is one of the **largest and brightest** **stars visible** to the naked eye.

**How have astronomers found the stage of Betelgeuse:**

Astronomers have suggested the **stage of the red giant star Betelgeuse** by studying its **pulsations**. Betelgeuse undergoes **periodic expansion and contraction** (similar to a boiling pot releasing steam), causing variations in its **brightness**. By analysing these **pulsations**, researchers **can infer the star’s current state**.

### [NASA’s Parker Solar Probe](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/13/nasas-parker-solar-probe/)  

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**Space**](https://www.space.com/parker-solar-probe-fast-solar-wind-source)

 **Context:** NASA’s Parker Solar Probe has discovered that “**coronal holes**” in the sun’s atmosphere are the source of the fast solar wind, released during the rapid realignment of magnetic fields.

**Findings:**

- The probe revealed that coronal holes — **darker, cooler regions that open in the sun’s outer atmosphere** — are shaped like “**showerheads”** made up of mostly evenly spaced funnels of material.
- **Magnetic reconnection within funnel structures** in coronal holes is responsible for generating the **fast solar wind.**

**Significance of finding**: By tracking the solar wind back to its origin, scientists can now better predict solar storms that can impact Earth’s communication and power infrastructure.

**What is a Solar storm:**

A solar storm refers to a **disturbance on the Sun** that releases a large amount of energy in the form of solar flares, coronal mass ejections (CMEs), or high-speed solar winds. These events can cause disruptions in **Earth’s magnetosphere**, leading to geomagnetic storms that impact communication systems, power grids, and satellite operations.

**About Parker Solar Probe**

The Parker Solar Probe is a NASA spacecraft **launched in 2018** to study the Sun up close. Its trajectory travel through the **Sun’s atmosphere**, closer to its surface than any previous spacecraft. The mission aims to **unlock the mysteries of the Sun’s atmosphere**, understand the **solar storm**, and investigate the processes that accelerate energetic particles.

Similar to Parker Solar Probe, ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation) is preparing to launch the **Aditya-L1 mission**, the first Indian space mission dedicated to **studying the Sun and the solar corona**. The mission will place a **satellite in a halo orbit around the Lagrange point 1 (L1) of the Sun-Earth systems**, located approximately **1.5 million km** away from Earth.
