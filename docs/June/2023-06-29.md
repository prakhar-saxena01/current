#### **GS Paper 1/3**

 **Syllabus:** **Geomorphology/Climate/ Conservation, Environmental Pollution and Degradation**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/climate-change/rockies-alps-himalayas-more-rain-less-snow-in-northern-hemisphere-mountains-as-temperatures-rise-says-report-90308)

 **Context:** According to a new study, a rise in temperature due to climate change could cause a shift in snowfall to rainfall in mountain regions across the Northern Hemisphere.

**Findings of the study:**

- The mountains across the Northern Hemisphere are likely to see **15% more rain for every 1-degree Celsius rise in temperature** due to climate change.
- **For 2 degrees and 3 degrees rise**, the world would see a 30 and 45% increase in rain, respectively.

**Most vulnerable:**

- **The Himalayas and the North American Pacific Mountain ranges**, including the Cascades, Sierra Nevada, and coastal ranges from Canada to Southern California are more threatened than the Rockies or the Alps.
- **The Himalayas** is one of those hotspot regions where an increased risk (due to changes in atmospheric dynamics) of rainfall extremes is witnessed.

**Impact:**

- A change in air temperature will shift snowfall in these regions to rainfall and **could increase the risk of disasters** such as floods, landslides, and soil erosion**.**
- **26% of the global population** living in or directly downstream of these mountainous regions is going to be directly affected by this risk.

**Concerns raised in the Water, Ice, Society, and Ecosystems in the Hindu Kush Himalaya (**[**HI-WISE**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/21/icimod-report-water-ice-society-and-ecosystems-in-the-hindu-kush-himalaya/)**) report:**

- The ICIMOD report found that the **Hindu Kush Himalayas have seen a 65% faster loss of glacier mass.**
- **Water availability** in the Indus, Ganges, and Brahmaputra is set to **increase** (through 2050) in the short term and **decrease** in the long term (~80% by 2100).
- **Climate change** is severely affecting **biodiversity** in HKH**. For example,** the habitat of Himalayan ibex is likely to reduce by 33 to 64%.

**Way ahead: Developing mountain-specific climate adaptation plans** to protect the natural and built environments.

**Syllabus:** **Statutory Bodies/Issues Relating to Development and Management of Social Sector/Services Relating to Education**

**Source:** [**PIB**](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1935895)

 **Context:** The Union Cabinet, chaired by the PM of India, approved the National Research Foundation (NRF) Bill 2023, to give the nation’s scientific research a strategic direction.

**Highlights of the Bill: It will establish NRF** and **repeal the Science and Engineering Research Board** (SERB) – subsuming it into the NRF.

- SERB is **a statutory body** under the **Department of Science and Technology** (DST) established in 2009 (by the SERB Act, 2008).
- It was set up for **promoting basic research in science and engineering** and **to provide financial assistance** to scientists, academic institutions, R&D laboratories, S&T start-ups, etc.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**National Research Foundation (NRF)**|   |
|**About**|NRF will be established as an **apex body** at a total estimated cost of ₹50,000 crores from 2023-28 (the government will contribute ₹10,000 crores and ~₹36,000 crores are expected to come from the private sector as investments).|
|**Recommendation**|National Education Policy (NEP) 2020|
|**Administrative department**|DST, Ministry of S&T|
|**Governed by**|**A Governing Board:** _The PM will be the ex-officio President_ of the Board and the Union Minister of S&T and Union Minister of Education will be the ex-officio Vice-Presidents. It will also consist of eminent researchers and professionals across disciplines.|
|**An Executive Council:** Chaired by the Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India.|
|**Purpose**|NRF will seed, grow and **promote R&D and foster a culture of research and innovation** throughout India’s universities, colleges, research institutions and R&D laboratories.|
|**How?**|**By prioritising research funding and ensuring that scientific research was conducted and funded equitably with greater participation from the private sector.**<br><br>Currently, the IITs and IISc receive the majority of research funds, whereas State universities receive a very little portion (~10%).|
|**By forging collaborations among the industry, academia, and government departments and research institutions and creating an interface mechanism for their participation and contribution.**|
|**By creating a policy framework and putting in place regulatory processes** that can encourage collaboration and increased spending by the industry on R&D.|
|**Significance/need of NRF/Bill**|**India barely spends 0.7% of its GDP on R&D**, which is extremely low compared to the US (2.83%), China (2.14%), Israel (4.9%), Brazil, Malaysia and Egypt.|
|NRF will promote the democratisation of science funding, finding solutions to the big problems facing Indian society, etc.|
|The Bill was necessary because current laws made it hard for private research organisations to contribute to a funding body such as the NRF.|

#### [Global Forest Watch](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/29/global-forest-watch/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus: Environment Conservation**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/explained-tropical-primary-forest-continued-decrease-in-2022/article67019284.ece#:~:text=The%20total%20global%20tree%20cover,by%20slightly%20less%20than%201%25.)

 **Context:** A study quoted by the **World Resources Institute’s Global Forest Watch** reveals that tropical areas experienced a **significant decline in forest cover in 2022.**

**Key findings:**

- The loss amounted to **4.****1 million hectares**, equivalent to an area the size of 11 football fields disappearing **every minute**.
- **The primary forest cover loss** in tropical regions was **10% higher in 2022** compared to the previous year.
- **The study highlights that the world is not on track to meet its forest-related commitments:**
- Two key goals set by the World Resources Institute include **ending deforestation by 2030**
    - However, the global deforestation rate **needs to decrease by at least** **10% annually** to meet the 2030 target.
    - While deforestation rates reduced **by 3.1% in 2022 compared** to the 2018-2020 baseline, they still exceeded the necessary levels by over one million hectares, indicating a deviation from the 2030 goal.
- **Restoring 350 million hectares of lost and degraded forests by 2030**.
    - The overall change in **tree cover over the past two decades** has been a **net loss of 100 million hectares.** This indicates that forests are still being lost instead of being restored at the required rate.
- Countries like **Brazil and the Democratic Republic of Congo**, with substantial tropical forest cover, **experienced significant losses in 2022**.
- **India**: The study also highlights **India’s loss of 44 thousand hectares** of humid primary forest between 2021 and 2022, accounting for **17% of the country’s total tree cover** loss during that period.

**What are Primary forests?**

**Primary forests, also known as old-growth forests or virgin forests**, are mature and undisturbed natural forests that have not experienced significant human intervention or alteration in recent history. These forests have **reached a stage of ecological maturity and exhibit a complex and diverse ecosystem** with fully developed tree canopy layers, understory vegetation, and rich biodiversity.

- **Significance:** They play a crucial role in **storing carbon and supporting biodiversity**. Once lost, the **regrowth of secondary forests cannot match the ecological and carbon sequestration** capabilities of primary forests.

**Global Forest Watch (launched 2014) is an open-source web application** to monitor global forests in near real-time. GFW is an initiative of the World Resources Institute, with partners including Google, USAID, the University of Maryland, Esri, Vizzuality and many other academic, non-profit, public, and private organizations.

#### [India’s Green Credit Programme](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/29/indias-green-credit-programme/)

####  **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Conservation, Environmental Pollution and Degradation**

**Source:** [**TP**](https://theprint.in/environment/govt-notifies-draft-rules-for-indias-green-credit-scheme-meant-to-incentivise-voluntary-action/1645430/)

 **Context:** Following the Union Budget 2023-24 announcement, the MoEFCC notified the draft ‘Green Credit Programme (GCP)’ implementation rules 2023.

**About the Green Credit Programme (GCP):**

- Under this, individuals, industries, FPOs, ULBs, gram panchayats and private sectors, etc., will be able to **earn “green credit” for undertaking environment-friendly actions**.
- The green credits will be **tradable** on a proposed domestic market platform.
- It follows the principle of **LiFE** – Lifestyle for Environment – to encourage sustainable lifestyles by driving consumers/communities towards behavioural changes to incentivise environment-friendly practices.

**The overall administration of the scheme:** It will be under the **Indian Council for Forestry Research and Education** – an autonomous organisation/ governmental agency under the MoEFCC.

**8 sectors/activities that can qualify for generating credits:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Sectors**|**Purpose**|
|**Tree plantation-based Green Credit**|To promote activities for increasing green cover across the country through tree plantation and related activities|
|**Water-based Green Credit**|To promote water conservation, water harvesting and water use efficiency/savings, including treatment and reuse of wastewater|
|**Sustainable agriculture-based Green Credit**|To promote natural and regenerative agricultural practices and land restoration to improve productivity, soil health and nutritional value of food produced|
|**Waste management-based Green Credit**|To promote sustainable and improved practices for waste management, including collection, segregation and treatment|
|**Air pollution reduction-based Green Credit**|To promote measures for reducing air pollution and other pollution-abatement activities|
|**Mangrove conservation and restoration-based Green Credit**|To promote measures for the conservation and restoration of mangroves|
|**Ecomark-based Green Credit**|To encourage manufacturers to obtain an eco-mark label for their goods and services|
|**Sustainable building and infrastructure-based Green Credit**|To encourage the construction of buildings and other infrastructure using sustainable technologies and materials|

**Objectives of GCP:**

- To create a **market-based** (supply and demand) **mechanism** for incentivising voluntary environmental actions/ individual or community behaviour.
- **To encourage the private sector** as well as other entities to meet their existing obligations, stemming from other legal frameworks.

**GCP vs carbon markets:** Unlike carbon markets, where only greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were traded, the GCP accounts for a wide range of actions and **nowhere in the world** such a wide range of actions are considered.

**Significance of the GCP:**

- It’s a first-of-its-kind instrument that seeks to **value and reward multiple ecosystem services** to allow green projects to achieve optimal returns beyond just carbon.
- The scheme will allow project proponents **to also access carbon markets additionally.**

 **Similar mechanisms elsewhere:** In some countries (France, Germany and Sweden), **social services generate credits** – taking care of the elderly for a certain number of hours, for instance, gets one some credit that you can exchange in a salon.

**Concerns:**

- The draft was a good statement of intent but its **implementation would be extremely challenging.**
    - This is due to the difficulty in establishing the **equivalence between various actions**.
    - **For example,** how much water one saved is equivalent to a tonne of CO2 prevented from emissions is difficult to establish.
- **Monitoring, reporting and verification challenges.**
- **A strong risk of greenwashing** – the appearance of doing a lot without actually achieving much beneficial impact.

**Way ahead:**

- **Capacity needs to be built** to monitor these systems and prevent fraud.
- **It will save resources** that could be diverted to more transformational pollution control and biodiversity protection efforts.

#### **GS Paper 4**

 **Syllabus: Application of ethics**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/vk-pandian-odishas-influential-bureaucrat/article67019398.ece#:~:text=Mr.%20Pandian%20is%20a%20Tamil,rapport%20with%20Mr.%20Naveen%20Patnaik.)**,** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/ashes-test-cricket-mind-experience-time-anxiety/article67018646.ece)

**Example 1:** 

**V.K. Pandian**, an influential bureaucrat and the private secretary to Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, has become a target of criticism from the opposition and certain factions within the BJD party.

The complaint raised concerns about his u**se of state transportation, public receptions, and announcements of new projects,** suggesting a violation of All India Services (Conduct) Rules.

**The elaborate security measures and protocols accompanying Mr Pandian’s visits** resemble those of **chief ministers and union ministers**, blurring the line between a politician and a bureaucrat.

**Ethical Issues concerned:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Ethical Issues**|**Description**|
|**Violation of All India Services (Conduct) Rules**|Concerns about adherence to ethical standards are expected from government officials such as Anonymity.|
|**Blurring of Lines between Politicians and Bureaucrats**|The elaborate security measures and protocols accompanying Mr Pandian’s visits, similar to those of chief ministers and union ministers, raise ethical questions regarding the **distinction between political and bureaucratic roles.**|
|**Concentration of Power**|Ethical considerations related to accountability, transparency, and democratic principles.|
|**Favoritism and Nepotism**|The close association between Mr Pandian and the Chief Minister, as well as the allegations of him being a “gateway” to the Chief Minister, may raise ethical concerns related to favouritism, preferential treatment, and equitable distribution of opportunities and resources.|

**Example 2: Discrimination in Cricket**

The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has issued an **apology following a report that revealed systemic discrimination within English cricket.** The report, conducted by the Independent Commission for Equity in Cricket (ICEC), highlighted instances of **racism, sexism, and class-based discrimination within the sport**.

The ECB expressed remorse for failing to **prevent these forms of discrimination and acknowledged the need for significant change**s. The report made 44 recommendations for reform, including **equal pay for male and female international players by 2030**.

**Ethical values highlighted:** Inclusivity, Equality, Anti-discrimination, Accountability, and Reform and improvement

**Example 3: ‘Selflessness’ in Public Life** 

- Cricketer Tendulkar reported on national duty after his father’s death
- Virat Kohli played a match-saving knock for his team after his father’s death
- Anil Kumble bowled with a **broken Jaw (2002)** against West Indies. He said, “**At least I can now go home with the thought that I tried my best.**

All these examples highlight the importance of ” **selflessness ” when it comes to ethics in public life/service.**

**Example 4: Lessons on Emotional Intelligence in Cricket** 

**Test cricket, unlike most other sports, requires long-term**, targeted behaviour and provides insights into how the **mind experiences time, reward, threat, and anxiety**.

**Understanding our ABCs (alarm-beliefs-coping)** and managing our mind’s reaction to time is crucial in cricket and life alike. Being emotionally intelligent helps players better their performance and reduce anxiety.

**Values extracted:**

- **Self-awareness** (recognizing and understanding one’s own emotions)
- **Self-regulation**
- **Building resilience** to anxiety through cognitive reattribution training (CRT);
- **Being flexible and adaptable** in response to changing circumstances, and developing strategies to cope with anxiety and negative emotions
- **Recognizing how anxiety can elongate the perception of time** and impact sleep, diet, and emotional stability, and managing it effectively.

 The Meira Paibis, also known as Imas or **Mothers of Manipur, are Meitei women who represent a powerful moral force in Manipur**.

They come from **all sections of society in the Imphal Valley and are widely respected**. The Meira Paibis are known for their **activism and have led various social and political movements in the state**. They have been involved in protests against human rights violations, demanded the repeal of the **Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA),** and supported causes such as the implementation of the **Inner Line Permit (ILP) system**.

 **Context:** The article discusses **how socialist tendencies** can have **unintended consequences**, concentrating wealth rather than spreading it and favouring **inheritors over entrepreneurs.**

**What is Socialism?**

Socialism is an **economic and political ideology** that advocates for the **collective ownership** and control of resources, means of production, and wealth distribution. It aims to create a **more equitable society by reducing inequality, promoting social welfare**, and ensuring that resources are allocated based on societal needs rather than individual profit.

**Issues:**

**Countries with deep socialist roots, including France, Sweden, Russia, and India**, are among those **where the risk of protests against billionaires is high**. This highlights the paradox that **socialist-leaning countries can still experience a concentration of wealth** and dissatisfaction with perceived inequality.

**Example:**

**France is a country vulnerable to anti-rich populist revolts** due to the rapid rise of billionaire wealth, particularly in family firms like **LVMH**. Recent protests in France targeted billionaires, including LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault, who has become a symbol of the **perceived wealth disparity.**

**Usage: The example can be used in Social Justice, Indian Society, PSIR and Sociology Paper**

 **Context:** The UNODC World Drug Report 2023 (a yearly report) highlights the **expanding illicit drug markets and the challenges they pose to health service**s and law enforcement.

**Key findings:**

- Over **296 million** people worldwide used drugs in 2021, a **23% increase** over the past decade.
- **The increasing dominance of synthetic drugs**, such as **methamphetamine**, and **fentanyl** which have transformed **illicit drug markets** due to their low cost and ease of production.
- Drug use disorder cases have **surged by 45%** in the last ten years
- **Accelerated environmental devastation** and crime caused by drug trafficking in the Amazon Basin.
- **Only one in five individuals** with drug use disorders received treatment in 2021, with significant regional disparities in access to treatment
- **Illicit drug economies** exacerbate conflicts, human rights abuses, and environmental devastation.
- **Illicit drug economies accelerate conflicts, human rights abuses**, and environmental devastation
- **Illicit drug trade finances non-state** armed and insurgency groups in the **Sahel region.** Prioritizing public health in regulating med

**On South Asia:**

The opium ban in Afghanistan had a positive result, but concerns remain about the production of synthetic drugs. Also, farmers’ income has suffered in Afghanistan due to the Opium ban by the Taliban.

**Recommendations:**

- The report calls for **increased monitoring of public health impacts** as regulatory changes and clinical trials involving psychedelics progress.
- **Prioritizing public health, prevention, and access** to treatment services worldwide to ensure that drug challenges do not leave more people behind.

**About UNODC:** 

**United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (est. 1997; HQ: Vienna)** focuses on the trafficking and abuse of illicit drugs, crime prevention and criminal justice, international terrorism, and political corruption. It is a member of the United Nations Development Group.
