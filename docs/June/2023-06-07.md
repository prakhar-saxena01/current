### [The practice of manual scavenging in India](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/07/the-practice-of-manual-scavenging-in-india/)

####  **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Mechanisms, Laws, Institutions and Bodies constituted for the Protection and Betterment of Vulnerable Sections**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/only-66-districts-in-country-free-of-manual-scavenging-social-justice-ministry-report/article66938734.ece)

**Context:** According to the Union Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment (MoSJ&E), **only 508 districts out of the total 766** in the country have declared themselves manual-scavenging free.

**The practice of manual scavenging in India:**

- **Meaning:** Manual scavenging includes the disposal of human excreta manually from dry latrines, and public streets and the maintenance and sweeping of septic tanks, sewers and gutters.
- **Prevalence in India:** As many as **58,000** people worked as manual scavengers as of 2018. **941 people have died since 1993** due to accidents while undertaking hazardous cleaning of sewer and septic tanks.
    - The practice, which is considered the worst remaining evidence of untouchability, is **most prevalent among people from lower castes/Dalits.**

**Attempts to abolish manual scavenging:**

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/law_say.png)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/law_say.png)**

**Salient features of the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act 2013:**

- **It bans manual scavenging**.
- **It widened the definition of manual scavengers** by including it in all forms of manual removal of human excreta.
- **It lays** a **key focus on rehabilitating the manual scavengers** by organising training programs (at a stipend of Rs. 3000) and offering scholarships to their children.
- It makes the offence of manual scavenging **cognizable and non-bailable.**
- It makes it **obligatory for employers to provide** **protective tools** to the workers.

**Other efforts:**

- **The scheme for rehabilitation of manual scavengers:** Under this, ~58,000 identified sewer workers have been **given a one-time cash payout of ₹40,000 each**.
    - In addition, ~22,000 of them have been connected to skills training programmes.
- **NAMASTE scheme:** For 100% mechanisation of sewer work. The scheme for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers has now been merged with the NAMASTE scheme.

**Concerns:**

- **Lack of funding:** The Union Budget 2023-24 showed no allocation for the rehabilitation scheme and ₹100 crore allocation for the NAMASTE scheme.
- **Less than half of the identified sewer workers** are connected to skills training programmes.
- Despite all efforts, manual scavenging is **still practised in India.**

**Way ahead:**

- All local bodies must **identify and profile all septic tank/sewer workers** in their respective areas.
- Provide them with **occupational training and safety equipment.**
- Sign them up for health insurance under the **Ayushman Bharat scheme.**

**Best practice:**

- **The Bandicoot Robot** is the world’s first robotic scavenger, developed as a Make in India and Swachh Bharat Abhiyan initiative by the startup Genrobotics.
- **Kerala became the first state** in the country to use robotic technology (Bandicoot) to clean all its commissioned manholes.

### [Pulses and Edible oil production in India](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/07/pulses-and-edible-oil-production-in-india/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Agricultural Produce and Issues and Related Constraints**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/how-india-has-become-relatively-atmanirbhar-in-pulses-compared-to-edible-oil-8645756/#:~:text=Private%20trade%20estimates%20of%20production,hardly%2040%25%20for%20edible%20oils.)

 **Context:** As compared to edible oil, India has relatively achieved atma nirbharta (self-reliance)  in pulses.

**Edible oil production in India:**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/produ.png)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/produ.png)

 **Import of edible oil by India:** The quantum of imports has surged from ~**8 mt to 16 mt** between 2013-14 and 2022-23 (from ~$7 to 21 billion in value terms).

**Govt efforts to increase edible oil production:**

- **National Food Security Mission – Oilseeds and Oil Palm** **(NFSM-OS and OP):** The government has been implementing this Centrally-sponsored scheme from 2018-19 to increase the production and productivity of oilseeds in the country.
- **National Mission on Edible Oils (Oil Palm)** [NMEO (OP)]

 **Concerns:** The productivity (yield) gap between improved technology and farmers’ practices ranged **from 21% in sesame to 149% in sunflower.**

**Case of pulses:**

- India is the **largest** producer (25% of global production), consumer (27% of world consumption) and importer (14%) of pulses in the world.
- Though pulses are grown in both Kharif and Rabi seasons, **Rabi pulses contribute more than 60% of the total production.**

**Import data: In quantity terms**, India’s **imports of pulses** came down from **6.61 mt in 2016-17** to **2.52 mt in 2022-23.**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/impor.jpg)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/impor.jpg)

**Breakup of India’s imports of major pulses:**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/tones.jpg)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/tones.jpg)

**Reasons behind the reduction in pulses imports:**

- **Higher domestic production:** India’s pulses output has increased from ~**19 mt in 2013-14 to 28 mt in 2022-23**, which translates into **a self-sufficiency ratio of over 90% in pulses** (40% for edible oils).
- **Imports of chickpea (chana) have recorded dramatic drops:** The boost to chana production came from two key government measures,
    - The first is the levy of a 60% import duty on chana since March 2018.
    - The second intervention has been **government procurement at minimum support prices (MSP).**
    - **These incentivised Indian farmers to expand the area under the pulses** crop grown during the rabi (winter-spring) season.

**Concerns:**

- **Arhar/Tur/pigeon pea is the problem:** Arhar imports from Mozambique, Myanmar, Tanzania, Malawi and Sudan hit a record**0.****9 mt in 2022-23.**
- **Implications of imports:** The overall import figures have not significantly reduced as a result of the erratic production of most non-chana pulses. **This may result in inflation amid worries about El Nino.**

**Way ahead:**

- The government must address **micro-irrigation, quality seeds, marketing infrastructure and government policy issues** to decrease dependency on imports.
- **Technology and market support to farmers** are the key to increasing oilseed production.

### [Tracking SDG7: The Energy Progress Report 2023](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/07/tracking-sdg7-the-energy-progress-report-2023/)

#### **GS Paper  3**

 **Syllabus: Economy: Energy/ SDGs**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/world/sdg-7-world-still-off-track-from-achieving-universal-energy-access-to-all-says-un-report-89856)

 **Context:** The world is facing challenges in achieving Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7) by 2030. (As per the **Tracking SDG7: The Energy Progress Report 2023 report)**

The report has been released by a collaborative effort of the **International Energy Agency (IEA), International Renewable Energy Agency, United Nations Statistics Division, World Bank and the WHO**

**What is SDG 7?**

SDG 7 refers to Sustainable Development Goal 7, which aims at reaching **universal access** to electricity and clean cooking, **doubling historic levels of efficiency** improvements, and substantially increasing the share of renewables in the global energy mix.

**Factors limiting the world in achieving SDG 7 are:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Factors**|**Examples**|
|**High inflation**|Rapidly increasing energy costs affecting affordability|
|**Uncertain macroeconomic outlook**|Fluctuating economic conditions impacting energy investments|
|**Debt distress**|Countries struggling with unsustainable debt burdens|
|**Lack of financing**|Insufficient funds for energy projects and infrastructure|
|**Supply chain bottlenecks**|Delays in procuring and delivering energy equipment and materials|
|**Tighter fiscal circumstances**|Government budget constraints limiting energy-related initiatives|
|**Soaring prices for materials**|Increased costs of solar panels, batteries, and other components|
|**Currency fluctuations**|Exchange rate instability impacting energy investments|
|**The concentration of financial flows**|Limited distribution of international public financial resources|
|**The decreasing trend in international public financial flows**|Reduction in funds supporting clean energy in developing countries|

**The report provides the following recommendations:**

- Scale up efforts to **promote renewable energy and energy efficiency** to meet the targets of SDG 7.
- **Enhance financial flows and investment** in clean energy technologies, especially in developing countries (to the tune of USD **1.****4-1.7 trillion** through 2030).
- **Address the challenges of high inflation**, uncertain macroeconomic outlook, and debt distress
- **Accelerate progress in energy intensity improvement** to exceed the targeted rate and ensure sustainable energy consumption patterns.
- **Strengthen international cooperation and support for countries** facing energy challenges, especially the least-developed countries and small island developing states.
- **Monitor and track progress regularly to identify gaps** and take necessary corrective measures.

**India’s status:**

- India is **‘On-Target’** to meeting **universal access to electricity**
    - **In April 2018 India** achieved its goal, ahead of schedule, of providing electricity to **every village in India**
- Despite a national policy push for **clean fuel for cooking**, **more than two-thirds (479) of districts remain ‘Off-Target’.**

**[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/counting_rip.png)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/counting_rip.png)**

**India’s initiatives for SDG7:**

- Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana (also known as Saubhagya)
- Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY) (separation of agricultural and non-agricultural feeders to improve supply)
- Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY) (for financial restructuring and turnaround plan for state DISCOMs)
- Atal Distribution System Improvement Yojana (ADITYA)
- PM-KUSUM

**About the 2030 SDG Agenda:**

 The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, also called the 2030 Agenda, was launched by a UN Summit in 2015 and is aimed at ending poverty in all its forms. There are 17 SDGs, which are an urgent call for action by all countries in a global partnership. 2023 marks the halfway point for achieving SDGs by 2030.

### [A just energy transition for a low-carbon future](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/07/a-just-energy-transition-for-a-low-carbon-future/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Infrastructure (Energy)/Conservation, Environmental Pollution and Degradation**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/low-carbon-indian-cities-sector-coupling-urban-topology-just-transition/article66936678.ece#:~:text=Transitioning%20to%20low%2Dcarbon%20or,necessary%20to%20decarbonise%20urban%20systems.)

 **Context:** Given the significant impact that cities have on the environment, low-carbon cities are crucial to mitigate the effects of climate change.

**How are cities impacting climate?**

- In 2020, cities across the world **dumped 29 trillion tonnes of CO2** into the atmosphere.
- This **CO2** along with other GHGs poses a **serious health hazard** and also **manifests as extreme weather events**, leading to the loss of lives and livelihoods.

**Challenges ahead:** By 2050, 7 billion people will be living in cities.

**Need of the hour – A just energy-system transition:**

- This could reduce urban CO2 emissions **by around 74%.**
- The transition must be implemented **both on the demand and the supply sides**.

**Mitigation options on the supply side:** Include phasing out fossil fuels and increasing the share of renewables in the energy mix, and using **carbon capture and storage** (CCS) technologies.

**On the demand side**:

- **Using the _Avoid, Shift, Improve_ framework** – reducing and substituting the demand for fossil fuels with renewables.
- **Addressing residual emissions** in the energy sector by implementing **CO2 removal (CDR) technologies.**

**Why is a just energy transition needed?**

- **A one-size-fits-all approach** is unlikely to ensure a socially and environmentally just transition.
    - **For example**, transitioning to renewable energy sources could disproportionately affect communities and fossil fuels-dependent sectors in developing economies.
- **Other concerns include** land dispossession related to large-scale renewable energy projects, spatial concentration of poverty, gendered impacts, etc.

**Significance of Indian states to achieve energy transition goals:**

- **States as spheres of implementation**: The realisation of national goals often depends on **how they are aligned with State priorities and capabilities**.
- **States as laboratories of policy innovations**: For example, PM KUSUM is a national adoption of successful State efforts on solarizing agriculture.
- **The legacy issues must be addressed at the State level:** Such as high losses, unreliable supply and service quality in the electricity sector.

**Good news:** With **rapid advancements** in clean energy and related technologies and reduced cost, the economic and technological barriers to implementing low-carbon solutions have been crossed.

**Way ahead:**

- **Transitioning to low-carbon/net-zero cities**: It is necessary to decarbonise urban systems.
- **Sector-coupling approach:** Integrate mitigation and adaptation options in multiple sectors, including energy, buildings, transportation, industry, and urban land use.
- **A State-level framework:** To understand plans, actions, and governance processes and to broaden the transition discourse.
- **Different strategies for different cities:** The considerations are a city’s spatial form, land-use pattern, level of development, and the state of urbanisation.
    - **The strategies include** energy-efficient services and infrastructure, people-centric urban design, and **implementing building codes** while gradually shifting to low-emission construction materials.
- **For a just energy transition:** The energy supply needs to be balanced against fast-growing energy demand (due to urbanisation), the need for energy security and exports.
- **Mitigation and adaptation responses:** Must engage multiple stakeholders in energy governance and decision-making, scaling up investments and capabilities, etc.

**Conclusion:**

- In the upcoming G20 forum, **India is planning to propose a multiple energy pathways** approach to accommodate the diverse development trajectories of countries.
- The diversity of India’s States, which necessitates multiple pathways, will determine its own domestic energy transition.

 **Context:** A German factory in Hamburg has developed a process to **convert cocoa bean shells into biochar,** a black powder that has the potential to counter climate change.

The shells are heated in an **oxygen-free environment**, which locks in greenhouse gases and produces biochar that can be used as **a fertilizer or as an ingredient in “green” concrete**. **Biochar** has the ability to capture a **significant amount of carbon dioxide (CO2)** from the atmosphere.

**Usage**: Indian government has also been emphasizing ‘biochar’. The example can be used in Agriculture/Environment Questions.
