### [USA’s Indo-Pacific Strategy](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/09/usas-indo-pacific-strategy/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **International Relations**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/india-us-defence-deal-pm-modi-joe-biden-china-8649345/)

**Context:** The geopolitical turmoil in Asia as a result of China’s rise will be a crucial background for the Indian PM’s discussions with the US President, as he travels to the US for a state visit.

**US-China conflict:**

- The 20th edition of the **annual Shangri-La Dialogue (SLD) in Singapore** highlighted the deepening tensions between the US and China.
- Since its inception in **2002**, the SLD has become the premium forum where defence ministers of Asia gather to **publicly articulate their positions on regional security**.

**USA’s Indo-Pacific strategy:**

- Despite the continuing crises in the Middle East and a major war in Europe, Washington has repeatedly reaffirmed that the **Indo-Pacific remains the highest priority.**
- **Removing the Asian fear** by explicitly challenging China’s claim to regional hegemony has been at the core of the **US Indo-Pacific strategy.**

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/indo.png)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/indo.png)** 

**USA approach towards China:**

- National actions include **measures for control of technology exports to China** and growing military support for Taiwan.
- The US is **mobilising a broad-based coalition** to balance China. **For example,** it has drawn (the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada) into the grand regional coalition.
- On the other hand, the US is **resuming high-level talks** on confidence-building measures to prevent the tensions from escalating.

**China’s position:**

- China is unwilling to accept the US terms of engagement and sees USA’s persistent call for high-level dialogue as a **trap**.
- China criticises the resurgent “**cold war mentality**” and demands that “**mutual respect should prevail over bullying and hegemony**”.

**Where do Asian countries stand?**

- China has been **grabbing disputed territories** from its neighbours and it is the US that is offering help to defend territorial sovereignty in Asia.
- Many Asian nations have **stepped up political and military engagement** [Quad, AUKUS, trilateral coordination with Seoul and Tokyo, **a local quad** (Australia, Japan, Philippines)] with the US despite Chinese warnings.
- **Yet, there is a reluctance in the region** to jeopardise the deep economic relationship with Beijing and a deliberate effort to **avoid politically offending China**.

**India and Japan in USA’s Strategy to Contain China:**

- **Japan:** The US has been encouraging Japan too –
    - Raise its military capabilities,
    - Modernising the military alliance with South Korea,
    - Revitalising military partnership with Manila and
    - Enhancing security cooperation with Indonesia.
- **India:** Building a **stronger strategic partnership with India** has been a high priority for the Biden administration.
    - The shared interests in **stabilising the Asian balance of power** are objective realities demanding a solid India-US defence partnership.
    - Currently, both are in talks for a **significant elevation of bilateral defence cooperation**, including technology transfers and joint defence industrial production.

**Conclusion:**

- The USA’s recent approach towards China is seen as an attempt **to reverse the dominant perception** that China’s domination of Asia is inevitable and America’s retreat is irreversible.
- It is trying to build a ‘**New Asia**’, where a US-led coalition will be the real hegemon.

**Context:** Thailand is known for its tourism. This article highlights **lessons that can be incorporated by India to boost its tourism sector.**

**Initiatives by Thailand:**

- Introducing **visa-free travel for G20 countries and Southeast Asian neighbours**, as Thailand does, to attract more foreign tourists.
- Thailand’s ability to **respond quickly to changes in the tourism industry,** as demonstrated by their **decision to eliminate the Thailand Pass requirement, boosted tourist arrivals.**

**Statistics of Tourism in India:**

- Attracted only **11 million tourists in 2019**.
- India’s Tourism is ranked **10th position in terms of its contribution to World GDP** (Gross Domestic Product) in the **World Travel and Tourism Council’s report in 2019.**
- During 2019, the **contribution of travel & tourism to GDP was 6.8% of the total economy**.
- In FY20, the tourism sector in India accounted for **39 million jobs, which was 8.0% of the total employment in the country.**By 2029, it is expected to account for about 53 million jobs.

**Examples from Thailand:**

- The presence of **street food options in a luxurious shopping mall**, where tourists can **order using QR codes and receive VAT refunds**. The affordability of the food contrasts with the expensive fashion brands available upstairs.
- Increasing **vegan and vegetarian options to attract** more Indian tourists.

### [Reviving rubber industry](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/09/reviving-rubber-industry/)

#### **GS3/ GS1 Paper** 

 **Syllabus: Agriculture/ Geography**

**Source:** [**BBC**](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65543616)

 **Context:** India’s rubber industry is facing challenges as production falls behind growing demand.

**About Rubber:**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/rubber.png)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/rubber.png)

**Status of the Rubber Industry:**

- **History**: The first rubber plantations in India were set up in **1895 on the hill slopes of Kerala**. However, rubber cultivation on a commercial scale was introduced in 1902.
- **Distribution:** **Kerala (the** largest producer of natural rubber in India); **Tamil Nadu;** Karnataka; Tripura, Assam, Andaman and Nicobar, Goa etc are some other rubber-producing States.
- **Natural rubber is preferred over synthetic rubber**due to its **high tensile strength** and **vibration-dampening properties**, along with tear resistance. This makes it important for the **construction and automobile industries**.

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rubber_con.jpg)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rubber_con.jpg)

**Key issues faced by the rubber industry in India:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Issue**|**Examples**|
|**Falling rubber prices**|Prices have plunged from a peak of **540 cents/kg in 2011 to 130 cents/kg in recent years**, discouraging rubber producers and leading to the abandonment of plantations.|
|**High labour costs**|**Labour-intensive activities like tapping rubber trees** require skilled workers, but paying for labour amid falling prices has made rubber plantations financially unattractive.|
|**Import competition**|Imports of rubber, usually available at lower prices than the domestic market, **drive down prices and further discourage domestic production**.|
|**Production-consumption gap**|The demand for natural rubber in India, primarily driven by the tire industry, has surged, creating a significant gap between production and consumption.|
|**Climate change**|Changing weather conditions, influenced by climate change, pose challenges to rubber farming, particularly in traditional cultivation areas like Kerala.|
|**Lack of technological adoption**|Limited adoption of technological advancements in the industry hinders **productivity and competitiveness.**|
|**Land conversion and fragmentation**|Instead of finding ways to increase production, some rubber plantations are being **sold or converted for other purposes, leading to the fragmentation of rubber holdings.**|

**Government’s initiatives in the Rubber sector:**

- **Rubber Plantation Development Scheme:** To support the development of rubber plantations by providing financial assistance to farmers
- **Rubber Group Planting Scheme**: Financial incentive by the government to form rubber farmer groups and societies.
- **National Rubber Policy 2019**: It includes provisions to **support the natural rubber production** sector and the entire rubber industry value chain.
- **Sustainable and Inclusive Development of the Natural Rubber Sector (**Implemented by the Rubber Board) for R&D in the rubber plantation.
- 100% Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in Rubber Plantations allowed

**Steps that can be taken to revive the rubber industry in India:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Steps**|**Examples**|
|**Promote Research and Development**|Establish dedicated research institutes and labs for rubber, focusing on developing **new varieties, improving cultivation techniques**, and addressing climate change challenges.|
|**GM Rubber**|Rubber Board research farm is growing the **world’s first genetically modified (GM) rubber plants,** tailored for the climatic conditions of Northeast India.|
|**Encourage the Adoption of Technology**|Promote the use of **modern farming technologies**, such as **rubber-tapping machines and automation**, to increase efficiency and reduce labour costs.|
|**Enhance Financial Support and Subsidies**|Provide financial assistance, subsidies, and loans to rubber farmers for plantation establishment, replantation, and adoption of modern cultivation practices.|
|**Improve Infrastructure and Logistics**|Establish **rubber clusters and industrial parks** to create a supportive ecosystem for rubber processing and value addition.|
|**Focus on Skill Development**|Collaborate with **educational institutions and vocational training centres** to offer specialized courses on rubber farming.|
|**Strengthen Market Linkages**|Encourage tie-ups between **farmers and rubber-based industries**, such as the tire manufacturing sector, to ensure a steady demand and fair prices|
|**Promotion of Rubber in India’s North East**|Four members of the ATMA in partnership with the **Rubber Board** have a plan to create **200,000 hectares of new rubber plantations** in **Northeast India and West Bengal.**|

**Conclusion:**

By implementing these measures, the rubber industry can regain its strength, boost production, and create a sustainable and prosperous future for rubber farmers in India.

**Context:** A cyclonic storm, **named Biparjoy**, has developed in the **Arabian Sea.**

- ‘Biparjoy’ was **suggested by Bangladesh** and the word **means ‘disaster’ or ‘calamity’ in Bengali**.

**About Cyclones:**

A **cyclone is a low-pressure system that forms over warm waters**. Usually, a high temperature anywhere means the **existence of low-pressure air, and a low temperature means high-pressure wind**.

**How are cyclones named?**

The naming of **cyclones is done by countries on a rotational basis**, following certain existing guidelines.

- Worldwide, there are **six regional specialised meteorological centres (RSMCs) and five regional Tropical Cyclone Warning Centres (TCWCs)** mandated for issuing advisories and naming of tropical cyclones.
- IMD is one of the six RSMCs to provide tropical cyclone and storm surge advisories to 13 member countries under the WMO/Economic and Social Commission for Asia-Pacific (ESCAP) Panel including **Bangladesh, India, Iran, Maldives, Myanmar, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, United Arab Emirates and Yemen.**

**Context:** Palaeoanthropologists have uncovered **evidence that suggests that Homo naledi,** an extinct human species, may have **buried their dead and carved meaningful symbols in a cave**.

- These behaviours were thought to be **unique to our own species – Homo sapiens – and the Neanderthals.**

The debate around burying the dead is based on differences between what scientists called **mortuary behaviour and funerary behaviour**.

- Mortuary behaviour is **evident among chimps and elephants**, for example, when they keep watch **over a dead body or physically interact with it, expecting it to come back to life**.
- Funerary behaviours, on the other hand, **are social acts by creatures that are capable of complex thought and understand them to be separate from the rest of the natural world**. They understand the significance of what death is.

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/genetic-diversity-depends-on-species-with-larger-body-sizes-mother-care-ccmb-scientists/article66942567.ece#:~:text=Genetic%20diversity%20is%20higher%20in,mother%20cares%20for%20the%20offspring.)

 **Context:** A study conducted by scientists from the **CSIR-Centre for Cellular & Molecular Biology (CCMB)** has revealed that genetic diversity decreases in species with larger body sizes and is higher in species where the mother cares for the offspring.

- The study focused on **centipedes** and found that they have higher **genetic diversity compared to other arthropods** like spiders and insects

**Other findings of the study:**

- Genetic diversity was found to be higher in the **southern hemisphere**: The findings suggest that **historic climatic stability and low seasonality** in southern latitudes may contribute to higher genetic diversity.
- Genetic diversity increased with the geographical distance between individuals, indicating limited gene flow between distant sites.

**What is Genetic Diversity?**

Genetic diversity refers to the variation in genetic information within a population or species. It is a **fundamental component of biodiversity** and plays a critical role in the survival, adaptability, and sustainability of species and ecosystems.

**Explanation using an example:**

In a population of butterflies, **genetic diversity refers to the presence of various genetic variations** that determine traits like **wing colour and patterns**. This diversity allows butterflies to adapt to different environments. **If a disease affects butterflies** with a specific wing colour, low genetic diversity can lead to population decline. However, high genetic diversity enables some butterflies to be resistant to the disease, ensuring population survival and recovery.
