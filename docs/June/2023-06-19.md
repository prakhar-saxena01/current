### [Reforming arbitration law](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/19/reforming-arbitration-law/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Govt policies and interventions**

**Source:** [**ET**](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/centre-sets-up-panel-led-by-former-law-secy-t-k-vishwanathan-to-recommend-reforms-in-arbitration-law/articleshow/101047183.cms?from=mdr)

 **Context:** The government has set up an expert panel led by former law secretary **T K Vishwanathan** to recommend reforms in **the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996**.

**3 methods of dispute resolution:**

- **Traditional Dispute Resolution:** Involves proceedings before an appropriate court of law according to the procedure established.
- **Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR):** These are more flexible and party-centric and include **negotiation, mediation, conciliation and arbitration**, and
- Hybrid Methods of Dispute Resolution

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ADR.png)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ADR.png)

**What is arbitration and conciliation?**

- Under arbitration, the parties concerned, **instead of approaching courts, opt for private dispute resolution through arbitrators.**
    - The decision of arbitrators is **binding**.
- **Conciliation is a (non-binding) process** in which a third party helps the parties in dispute to resolve it by way of agreement. The person authorised to do so is called a Conciliator.

**Need to evolve alternative mechanisms:**

- To reduce the burden of the Courts.
- To provide speedy access to justice along with the revival and strengthening of traditional systems of dispute resolution.

**Legal backing to the alternative mechanisms:**

- **‘Section 89’ in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908**, opened the passage of statutory reference to ADR, either by the Courts or the parties themselves.
- **The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996:** The legislative intent of the Act is to bring domestic as well as international commercial arbitration in consonance with –
    - The UNCITRAL Model Rules,
    - The New York Convention and the Geneva Convention.

**Salient provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996:**

- It **consolidates and amends** the law relating to –
    - Domestic arbitration,
    - International commercial arbitration and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards, and
    - Define the law relating to conciliation.
- **The Act provides the procedure** to be followed in arbitration proceedings, arbitral tribunal, the conduct of the tribunal along with the arbitral awards to be made in a dispute.
- **The decision is binding** on the parties and given in the form of an arbitral award in an arbitration agreement.
- **It also prescribes the procedure of appeal** to courts in case of discrepancies.

**The main objective of the Act**:

- **To make provision for an arbitral procedure** which is fair, efficient and capable of meeting the needs of the specific arbitration.
- **To minimise the supervisory role of the courts** in the arbitral process.
- **To permit an arbitral tribunal** to use mediation, conciliation or other procedures during the arbitral proceedings in the settlement of the disputes.

**The main issue faced by the dispute resolution environment in India:**

- **Increased court intervention** in the whole process.
- Thus, arbitration has **no longer remained** a truly party-driven, cost-effective and time-bound process.

**Why is the T K Vishwanathan committee constituted?**

- As a continuous endeavour **to promote ease of doing business**, the Department of Legal Affairs is considering the need to further reform the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996.
- This will help India become a **hub for international arbitration and reduce the burden on courts.**

**The terms of reference for the committee:**

- **To evaluate and analyse the operation of the present arbitration** ecosystem of the country, including the working of the Arbitration Act.
- **To highlight the Arbitration Act’s strengths and weaknesses** and challenges vis-a-vis other important foreign jurisdictions.
- **To recommend a framework of model arbitration system** which is efficient, effective and economical and caters to the requirements of the users.
- **To devise a strategy for developing a competitive environment** in the arbitration services market for domestic and international parties.

### [Punchhi Commission Recommendations and Potential Solutions for Manipur Crisis](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/19/punchhi-commission-recommendations-and-potential-solutions-for-manipur-crisis/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus****: Polity – Centre-State Relations**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/how-an-old-report-can-pave-way-for-central-forces-to-stabilise-manipur-8667810/)

 **Context**: The recent crisis in Manipur has **sparked renewed interest in the Punchhi Commission Recommendations**, which offer **potential solutions for effectively managing such situations.**

**About Punchhi Commission:**

- The government constituted the **Second Commission on Interstate Relations under the chairmanship of Justice (retired) Madan Mohan Punchhi**, former Chief Justice of India along with other eminent persons in 2007.
- The **Commission set up eight task forces to examine the Centre-state relations in depth**. Their Fifth Task Force studied **criminal justice, national security and Centre-state cooperation**.
- The Commission submitted its report in 2010, **but the government could not introduce constitutional changes recommended by the Punchhi Commission**.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Recommendation**|**Description**|
|**Feasibility of legislation under Article 355**|Examined the possibility of enacting supporting legislation **under Article 355** to **enable the suo motu deployment of Central forces in states** when the situation demands.|
|**Localised Emergency provisions under Article 355**|Recommended the adoption of **“Localised Emergency provisions”** under **Article 355,** allowing the imposition of Central rule in a limited affected area of a state, such as a municipality or a district**, while the rest of the elected state government continues undisturbed.**|
|**The time limit for Central rule under Article 355**|Proposed that the **Central rule in a limited affected area should not extend beyond three months.**|
|**Amendments to the Communal Violence Bill**|Suggested amendments to the **Communal Violence Bill** to include provisions **that state consent should not hinder the deployment of Central forces in serious communal riots.** However, the deployment should be limited to one week, with post-facto consent obtained from the state.|
|**A historical example of countering insurgency**|Cited the example of countering the **Telangana insurgency in 1950,** where the entire administration, including law and order, of a portion of the state was given to the **Central Intelligence Bureau with a mandate to eliminate insurgents within six months.**|

**Significance of these recommendations**:

- The implementation of these recommendations **could have potentially allowed the Centre to take over the administration of specific areas in Manipur without disrupting the elected government**.

**Conclusion:**

If these recommendations had been codified through constitutional amendments, **they could have provided a political solution to the ongoing conflicts in Manipur and other regions**, allowing for more effective management of such situations.

### [Reforming WTO](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/19/reforming-wto/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Important International Institutions, agencies and fora – their Structure, Mandate**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/how-india-can-lead-multilateralism-at-wto-8667817/)

 **Context:** The recently concluded [G20](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/10/sansad-tv-world360-degree-g20/) working group meeting on trade and investment focused on the important issue of WTO reform.

**World Trade Organization (WTO):**

- It is a member-driven, consensus-based **intergovernmental organisation** that regulates and facilitates international trade between nations.
- It is the **world’s largest international economic organisation** (HQ – Geneva, Switzerland), with **164 member states** representing over 98% of global trade and global GDP.
- It officially began operations on January 1, **1995**, in accordance with the 1994 **Marrakesh Agreement.**
- It replaced the 1948 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).

**What led to the establishment of the WTO?**

- **The prevailing idea that trade policy is foreign policy** because economic interdependence would deter security confrontation.
- The WTO aimed at **legalising and policing economic interdependence**.

**Current situation:**

- Today’s world is dominated by **geoeconomic considerations and heightened securitisation** of international economic relations.
- **The pursuit of unilateralism** in international economic relations, especially by developed countries like the US.
- Economic policies such as **industrial subsidies and local content requirements** have made a comeback.
- There is a **deliberate effort to weaken trade multilateralism** in favour of external plurilateral alignments keeping the big power confrontation in mind.

**Challenges:** A weak WTO perfectly suits the US as part of its foreign policy aimed at strategic rivalry with China.

**The role to be played by G20:**

- The G20 members are key players in the WTO.
- The push for WTO reforms must come from **G20’s “middle powers”** such as _India, Indonesia, Brazil, and South Africa_.

**Critical areas that developing countries should focus on:**

- **The presence of special and differential treatment (SDT) principles** in WTO agreements.
    - SDT provisions give **special rights to developing countries** and obligate developed countries to treat the former more favourably.
    - However, **only 21%** of the SDT provisions in various WTO agreements oblige developed countries to actually provide differential treatment to developing countries.
    - Therefore, SDT provisions need to be given **more teeth and any effort to weaken this treaty-embedded right** in the name of WTO reform should be opposed.
- **The appellate body** – the 2nd tier of the WTO’s two-tiered dispute settlement body – remains paralysed since 2019.
    - This is part of the US’s overall game plan **to dilute the policing part of the WTO** to pursue trade unilateralism without many checks.
    - The remaining G20 countries need to either persuade the US or resurrect the appellate body without the US.
- **There is a need to develop a multilateral governance framework for plurilateral agreements**.
    - From 2017 onward, there has been **a shift away from consensus-based decision-making principles** toward plurilateral discussions on issues like investment facilitation.
    - However, forcing plurilateral agreements on non-willing members will accentuate the **trust deficit between developed and developing countries.**
    - Therefore, **a multilateral governance framework** should include key principles of **non-discrimination, transparency and inclusivity** in the WTO rulebook.
- **It is imperative to address the transparency gap in the WTO.**
    - Although WTO member countries are obliged to notify all their laws and regulations that affect trade, compliance with this obligation is poor.
    - **This increases the cost of trade, especially for developing countries.**

**Conclusion:**

- **Trade multilateralism** might be out of fashion, but remains of vital salience for countries like India.
- Therefore, under its Presidency of the G20, India should work with others to drive the WTO reforms agenda aimed at making **trade multilateralism inclusive.**

### [Groundwater Extraction Alters Earth’s Rotation](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/19/groundwater-extraction-alters-earths-rotation/)

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/excessive-groundwater-depletion-has-knocked-earths-axis-off-kilter/article66980307.ece)

**Context:** A recent study published in the journal **Geophysical Research Letters** reveals that extensive groundwater extraction by humans has had a significant effect on Earth’s rotation.

**Findings:**

**Between 1993 and 2010**, the excessive pumping of groundwater caused the **planet’s rotational pole to shift eastward by approximately 80 centimetres.** The research indicates that humans extracted around 2**,150 gigatons of groundwater** during this period, equivalent to over 6 millimetres of sea-level rise.

**How groundwater extraction influences Earth’s rotation?**

When we take a lot of water out from underground (groundwater extraction), it changes how the Earth spins (called ‘polar drift’).

**Imagine spinning a top and then adding or removing weight from one side**. The top will wobble or spin differently. Similarly, when we extract groundwater, it shifts the weight distribution on Earth’s surface, causing a slight change in its rotation. This can move the Earth’s axis (the imaginary line it spins around) a little bit.

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/axial.jpg)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/axial.jpg)

**Impact:**

**While it doesn’t affect our daily lives much**, scientists study these changes because **they can impact the Earth’s climate** over long periods of time.

**Other factors: Melting of glaciers** -Climate change has caused billions of tonnes of glacial ice to melt into oceans. This has caused the Earth’s poles to move in new directions.

**Context:** Germany has proposed **transitioning to carbon-neutral synthetic fuels** for existing internal combustion vehicles instead of phasing them out completely.

**Reasons for such a proposal:**

- **Even though electric vehicles and hydrogen fuel** cells **have zero-emission during usage**, their manufacturing processes have significant environmental impacts.
- **Approximately 90% of the world’s vehicles** are expected to be internal combustion by 2030, and replacing them entirely would not be a zero-carbon solution.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Synthetic Hydrocarbon Fuel**|   |
|**About**|Synthetic hydrocarbon fuel is a type of fuel that is artificially created through **chemical processes using carbon-based feedstocks**.|
|**Production**|Synthetic hydrocarbon fuel is produced by **combining carbon dioxide (CO2) captured from the atmosphere with hydrogen**. The carbon dioxide is **typically sourced through direct air capture or other methods**, while the hydrogen can be generated using renewable energy sources like the electrolysis of water.|
|[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/synthetic.jpg)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/synthetic.jpg)|   |
|**Benefits**|Producing synthetic fuel could be **carbon-negative if the carbon emissions** from the fuel are less than the carbon captured during the production process. Even if there is a net carbon release, it may still be **lower than the carbon impact of manufacturing a large number of electric vehicles (EVs).**|
|**Challenges**|**High initial cost compared to petrol or diesel**; engineering hurdles inefficient carbon capture; need for advancements in green hydrogen electrolysis|

**Context**: Researchers have discovered that the Y chromosome **possesses genes linked to ageing and lifespan regulation.**

- The Y chromosome, known as the **“master of maleness,”** determines **the biological male sex and carries genes that play a role in sex determination.**

**Findings:**

- Recent research has revealed that the Y **chromosome possesses genes vital to biological functions, including those related to ageing and lifespan regulation.**
- The **study of species that have naturally lost their Y chromosome**, such as rodents, provides insights **into sex-chromosome turnover and the repurposing of other chromosomes as sex chromosomes**.
- The **genome sequences of Neanderthals indicate the replacement of the Y chromosome in modern humans, suggesting that the Y chromosome may eventually yield its role as the “master of maleness” to another chromosome.**

Chromosomes are **thread-like structures found in the nucleus of cells** that carry genetic information. Chromosomes come in pairs, with **each pair containing one chromosome inherited from the mother and one from the father**. Humans typically have **23 pairs of chromosomes**, for a total of **46 chromosomes** in most cells (except for reproductive cells which have 23 chromosomes). Chromosomes play a **crucial role in cell division and inheritance.**

**Context**: Researchers **demystify the unusual origin of the Geminids meteor shower.**

- **NASA’s Parker Solar Probe** mission is providing new evidence that a violent, catastrophic event created the Geminids.

**Findings:**

- While most meteor showers originate from comets, the Geminids are believed to come from an **asteroid called 3200 Phaethon**. Unlike comets, **asteroids like Phaethon are not typically affected by the Sun’s heat.**
- By analysing the data collected by the Parker Solar Probe, the **scientists modelled three possible scenarios for the formation of the Geminid stream and compared them to existing models based on Earth-based observations**.
- They concluded that violent scenarios, **such as high-speed collisions or gaseous explosions, were the most consistent with the Parker data**. This suggests that a sudden and powerful event likely triggered the creation of the Geminid meteor stream from Phaethon.

**About the mission:** 

**The Parker Solar Probe is a NASA space probe launched in 2018** with the mission of making observations of the **outer corona of the Sun**. It will approach the **closest** to the sun by 2025.

 **Context:** The Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change has released the **“National Working Plan Code-2023”** for the scientific management of forests and evolving new approaches.

**What is Scientific Forest Management?**

Scientific forest management is an approach that involves the **application of scientific principles and techniques to manage forests sustainably**. It focuses on gathering data, conducting research, and utilizing **evidence-based practices** to ensure the long-term health and productivity of forests.

**About the plan code:**

- **Aim**: The plan aims to provide **social, economic, cultural, and spiritual benefits** from forests.
- **Standards: “Indian Forest Management Standard**” which is a part of this code, takes into account the diverse forest ecosystem in our country while trying to bring uniformity in management.
    - **The code brings uniformity and acts as a guiding principle** for the preparation of working plans across different forest divisions and states.
    - The standard aligns with **international criteria and indicators** for sustainable forest management.
- **Institutional framework:** It establishes the **policy, legal, and institutional framework necessary** for effective forest management.
    - For the first time, **continuous data collection and updation** in a centralized database are prescribed for state forest departments.
    - It enables **state** **forest** **departments to measure the effectiveness of their management practices** against the prescriptions of the working plans.

**Context:** The **wild orchids of North Bengal**, known for their beauty, fragrance, and medicinal properties, are disappearing due to **deforestation** in their natural habitat.

**About Orchids:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
||**Description**|
|Orchids are **a diverse group of flowering plants** known for their **vibrant and intricate flowers**. They belong to the family **Orchidaceae**.<br><br>[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/wild.jpg)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/wild.jpg)|   |

|**Three Types of Orchids**|**Epiphytic**: They are **plants growing on another plant** including those growing on rock boulders and are often termed lithophytes. **About 60% of all orchids** found in India are **epiphytic**.|
|**Terrestrial**: They are plants growing on land and climbers. These grow **directly on the soil and are found in large numbers** in temperate and alpine regions.|
|**Mycoheterotrophic**: They are plants **which derive nutrients** from **mycorrhizal fungi** that are attached to the roots of a vascular plant.|
|**Distribution**||
|**Himalayan Zone**: Richest in orchid species|
|**Northeast India**: Highest species concentration|
|**Western Ghats**: High endemism of orchids|
|**Highest Number of Orchid Species**: Arunachal Pradesh> Sikkim> West Bengal|
|**International Protection**|Orchid family listed under **Appendix II of CITES**, banning global trade of wild orchids|

The mass deaths of **approximately 300 wild birds along Mexico’s Pacific coast** are likely attributed to El Niño. Warmer waters (due to El Nino) cause fish to swim deeper, making it harder for seabirds to find food, which could be a contributing factor to the bird deaths. Similar occurrences of dead seabirds were reported in **Peru and Chile.**

Mexico is a country in the **southern portion of North America**. It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico.
