### [Preventing train accidents in India](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/05/preventing-train-accidents-in-india/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Infrastructure (Railways)**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/odisha-accident-senior-official-had-alerted-railway-on-serious-flaws-in-signalling-system/article66930016.ece)

 **Context:** The tragic Odisha train accident that resulted in the death of over 288 passengers has brought into sharp focus the safety mechanisms needed to prevent such tragedies.

**Why do train accidents happen in India?** 

**The Performance Audit on Derailment in Indian Railways – a CAG (2022) report** ascertains whether measures to prevent derailments and collisions were clearly laid down and implemented. 

**Findings in the CAG audit report:**

- **The main reason** behind train accidents in India is
    - **For example**, out of 217 “consequential train accidents” – that have serious repercussions in terms of either loss of human life/injury or loss of Railway property/traffic interruption, 163 (75%) were due to derailments during 2017-18 to 2020-21.
- **Factors responsible for derailments** are maintenance of tracks, deviation of track parameters beyond permissible limits, bad driving and overspeeding, and faulty signalling system (suspected cause of the Odisha train accident). 

**Some initiatives of the Indian govt. to prevent train accidents:**

**The KAVACH:**

- It is an **indigenously** developed Automatic Train Protection (**ATP**) system by the Research Design and Standards Organisation (**RDSO**) in collaboration with the Indian industry.
- **It provides protection** by preventing trains from passing the signal at Red and **activates the train’s braking system automatically** (if the driver jumps the Red signal) and avoids collision.
- **The Traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS)** helps in two-way communication between the station master and loco-pilot to convey any emergency message.
- Both the Shalimar-Chennai Coromandel Express and the Yeshwanthpur-Howrah Express were **not fitted with KAVACH-TCAS**. 

**The** **Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh (RRSK):**

- It was **created in 2017-18 with a corpus of Rs 1 lakh crore** over a period of five years with an annual outlay of Rs 20,000 crore – Rs 15,000 crore of budgetary support and Rs 5,000 crore from Railways internal resources).
- **The safety fund will be used for** improved inspection and safety work at level crossing, track repair, bridge restoration, rolling stock replacement, human resource development, etc.
- **The number of funds allocated for track renewal projects decreased** from Rs 9,607.65 crore (2018-19) to Rs 7,417 crore (2019-20), and even this amount was **not “fully utilised”.**

### [Importance of Biodiversity](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/05/importance-of-biodiversity/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Conservation, Environmental Pollution and Degradation**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/biodiversity-is-us-and-we-are-biodiversity/article66916822.ece#:~:text=Nurturing%20and%20managing%20biodiversity,from%20this%20International%20Biodiversity%20Day.)

 **Context:** Despite the importance of biodiversity that ultimately sustains all human endeavours, not enough has been done for caring and nurturing life on earth.

**Biodiversity/Biological diversity:**

- **Meaning:** The rich variety of life forms and their interconnections with each other and the environment is termed Biodiversity**.**
- **Types:** Genetic diversity (variety of genes within a species), species diversity (variety of species within a habitat or a region) and ecosystem diversity (variety of species within a habitat or a region).
- **Importance of Biodiversity:**
    - **Ecosystem services:** Species perform some or the other functions (soil formation, reducing pollution) in an ecosystem.
    - **Provisioning services**: Food, fibre, fuelwood, etc. It is biodiversity that will form the basis of a **new sustainable green economy.**
    - **Regulating services:** It is biodiversity that will restore degraded lands and polluted rivers and oceans and sustain agriculture in the face of climate change.
    - **Supporting services:** Biodiversity helps in pollination, nutrient cycling as well as recycling, GHGs reduction by sequestration.
    - **Social and cultural services:** Biodiversity provides aesthetic, and recreational pleasure.
    - **Food web maintenance:** Higher the diversity of an ecosystem, more complex is going to be the food webs.
    - **Scientific role:** Biodiversity help in scientific research, education and monitoring.
- **Threats:**

|[**The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF)**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/22/a-new-global-biodiversity-framework/)|

**Way ahead:**

- **Civil society** must play a critical role in sustaining biodiversity.
- **A paradigm shift in the care of biodiversity.**
    - **For example,** the main custodian of the natural world in India is the **Indian Forest Service.**
    - Therefore, a **multifunctional landscapes approach**, with the **direct participation of local communities** is the need of the hour.

**Some best practices from India:**

- **The Forest Rights Act 2006:** It calls for an increase in the stake of indigenous groups in ownership as well as management of biodiversity. However, the Act largely remains on paper.
- **National Mission on Biodiversity and Human Wellbeing:** It is a proposed mission (**India’s Biodiversity Collaborative** based in Bengaluru, conceptualised the idea) to have all citizens engaged in the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity.

**Conclusion:** It is time to decentralise the management of biodiversity by bringing together multiple stakeholders, especially local communities, through gram sabhas and biodiversity management committees.

### [Oil reserves in salt caverns](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/05/oil-reserves-in-salt-caverns/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus****: Economy**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/explained-economics-oil-reserves-in-salt-caverns-8643242/)

**Context:** Government-owned engineering consultancy firm Engineers India (EIL) is studying the **prospects and feasibility of developing salt cavern-based strategic oil reserves in Rajasthan**.

- This is in line with the **government’s objective of increasing the country’s strategic oil storage capacity.**

The country’s three existing [strategic oil storage](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/11/24/strategic-petroleum-reserves-spr-programme-2/) facilities — **at Mangaluru and Padur in Karnataka, and Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh** — are made up of excavated rock caverns.

**About Strategic Oil Reserves:**

- A strategic oil reserve refers to a stockpile of crude oil or petroleum products that a country maintains as a strategic **measure to ensure energy security and stability in times of emergencies or disruptions in oil supply.**
- **The International Energy Agency (IEA)** recommends that all countries maintain emergency oil **stockpiles equivalent to 90 days of import protection.**

**Statistics about Oil Reserves In India:**

- India, the **world’s third-largest consumer of crude, depends on imports for more than 85% of its requirement**.
- India currently has an **SPR capacity of 5.33 million tonnes or around 39 million barrels of crude**. India’s strategic petroleum reserves (SPR) currently **provide around 9.5 days of oil requirement coverage.**
- Additionally, oil marketing companies in India have their storage facilities, providing an additional 64.5 days of storage, totalling **approximately 74 days of petroleum demand coverage.**
- India’s strategic crude oil storages are currently located at **Visakhapatnam** (Andhra Pradesh), **Mangaluru** (Karnataka), **Padur** (Karnataka) and **Chandikhol in Odisha.**
- The construction of the **Strategic Crude Oil Storage facilities**in India is being managed by **Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserves Limited (ISPRL) (a** wholly owned subsidiary of Oil Industry Development Board (OIDB) under the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas).

**Underground storage**

It is, by far the most **economical method of storing petroleum products** because the underground facility **rules out the requirement of large swathes of land**, ensures less evaporation and, since the caverns are built much below the sea level, it is easy to **discharge crude into them from ships.**

**Two types of underground reserves:**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
||**Salt Cavern-Based Reserves**|**Rock Cavern-Based Reserves**|
|**Development Process**|Developed through **solution mining**, involving the dissolution of salt deposits|Developed through excavation|
|**Cost and Time**|Simpler, faster, and less cost-intensive|More complex, time-consuming, and expensive|
|**Sealing and Accessibility**|Naturally **well-sealed and engineered** for rapid injection and extraction|May require additional sealing measures and access points|
|**Oil Absorbency**|Extremely low oil absorbency, creating a natural impermeable barrier|Absorbency varies depending on the rock type|
|**Operation**|Can be created and operated almost entirely from the surface|Requires excavation and underground operations|
|**Examples**|**US Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR**) consists of salt cavern-based storage facilities|**Mangaluru and Padur in Karnataka, and Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh**|
|**Usage**|Primarily used for oil storage, but also **suitable for liquid fuels, natural gas, compressed air, and hydrogen**|Primarily used for oil storage|

### [E-Waste: Solar panels](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/05/e-waste-solar-panels/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus: E-Waste**

**Source:** [**BBC**](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-65602519)

 **Context:** Solar panels, hailed as a crucial tool in reducing carbon emissions, face the challenge of disposal and replacement as they only **last up to 25 years.**

**What is Solar E-Waste?**

[Solar e-waste](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/31/how-to-manage-indias-solar-pv-waste-problem/) refers to the electronic waste generated by discarded solar panels. As solar panels have a limited **lifespan of 20-25 years**, their disposal raises concerns about managing the electronic waste they create.

**What does Solar Panel consist of?**

A PV module is essentially made up of **glass, metal, silicon and polymer fractions**. Glass and aluminium, together constituting **around 80% of total weight**, are **non-hazardous.**

But a few other materials used including **polymers, metals, metallic compounds and alloys** are classified as **potentially hazardous**.

**Status:**

- PV module recycling is **still not commercially viable**
- PV waste recycling is **still at a nascent stage globally**
- **India does not have a solar waste management policy**, but it does have ambitious [solar power installation targets.](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/22/india-misses-renewable-energy-parliamentary-panel/) 
- India’s PV (photovoltaic) waste volume is estimated to grow to **2,00,000 tonnes by 2030** and around 2 million tonnes by 2050.

**Issues with Solar E-Waste Management:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Issue**|**Example**|
|**Lack of comprehensive policy**|Many countries, including India, lack comprehensive policies and regulations specifically addressing the management of solar e-waste.|
|**Increasing volume of solar waste**|India could generate over 34,600 tonnes of solar waste by 2030|
|**Limited recycling infrastructure**|Insufficient recycling plants and infrastructure|
|**High cost of recycling**|Recycling a solar panel costs between $20 and $30, while landfill disposal costs $1-2|
|**Toxic materials in the solar waste**|Solar panels contain toxic metals and minerals that can harm the environment when not properly managed|
|**Limited awareness and enforcement**|Lack of awareness among stakeholders and inadequate enforcement of recycling regulations|
|**Landfill disposal**|Improper disposal of solar waste in landfills, posing environmental risks|
|**Resource wastage**|Discarded solar panels contain valuable materials like silver, copper, and semiconductor-grade quartz.|

**Various technologies available to extract valuable materials from solar e-waste include:**

- **Mechanical Shredding**: Solar panels can be shredded into small pieces and subsequent separation techniques to recover metals like aluminium and copper.
- **Thermal Treatment**: Thermal processes, such as pyrolysis and gasification, can be employed to break down solar panels at high temperatures, recovering valuable materials and generating energy-rich gases or liquids.
- **Chemical Leaching:** Chemical solvents or acids can be used to dissolve and separate valuable metals, such as silver and copper, from the solar panel components.
- **Electrochemical Processes**: Electrochemical methods can be utilized to selectively extract metals from **solar panel components** by applying electrical currents or potential differences.
- **Automated Robotic Systems**: Advanced robotic systems equipped with **sensors and artificial intelligence** can be used to **identify and separate different components** of solar panels for efficient material recovery.

**Recent Government Initiative:**

- **The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change** added Solar Waste Treatment under [E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2022](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/11/11/government-notified-e-waste-management-rules-2022/) in November 2022.
- **Green Credit Programme**: Launched under the [Environmental Protection Act (1986)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/environmental-governance-national-legislation/) and announced in the [Budget 2022-2023](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/BUDGET-SUMMARY.pdf), it aims to promote **green growth and sustainable practices.**

**Solar waste management by other countries**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Country**|**Approach**|
|**European Union**|Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) and Directive and Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)|
|||
|**United Kingdom**|Industry-managed take-back and recycling scheme|
|**United States**|State-level regulations and Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) regulations, but no federal law|
|||
|**Australia**|**National Product Stewardship Investment Fund**: $2 million grant to develop industry-led PV product stewardship scheme|
|||
|**Japan**|**Voluntary guidelines** to ensure proper recycling of solar PV modules have been issued by the Japan Photovoltaic Energy Association (JPEA).|
|**South Korea**|Dedicated legislation to address the PV waste problem|

**What India can do to promote solar waste management:**

|   |
|---|
|**Approach**|
|**Mandating module manufacturers to use environmentally sustainable design** and materials with end-of-life in mind E.g., Similar to the **eco-design initiative** of the EU|
|**Specifying the liability and responsibility** of each stakeholder for waste management and treatment|
|Laying down standards for **PV waste collection**, treatment, and disposal|
|Encouraging **mutual recycling responsibility agreements** between module suppliers, project developers, and power purchasers|
|**Conducting surveys and assessments of existing recycling facilities** to determine their technology capabilities and capacity, identifying areas for improvement|
|Investing in **recycling infrastructure to reduce costs, improving coordination between the energy and waste** sectors to handle renewable energy waste, establishing more recycling plants|
|Including provisions for **environmentally sound disposal and recycling of the solar waste** in power purchase agreements signed by SECI/DISCOMS/government with project developers|
|**Ban on landfills:** Implementing regulations or policies that prohibit the disposal of solar panel waste in landfills|
|**Supporting research and development efforts** to drive innovation in PV design, reducing waste generation, and advancing technology to mitigate the environmental impact of renewable energy waste|

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/adverse-possession-law-commission-8645815/)

**Context:** The Law Commission, in its recent report, stated that no changes in the law relating to adverse possession are required. However, two members dissented, arguing that the law promotes false claims and should be struck off.

**About** [**Adverse possession**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/01/13/private-property-is-a-human-right-supreme-court/#:~:text=The%20state%20cannot%20trespass%20into,property%20is%20a%20human%20right.)**:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Topic**|**Information**|
|**Adverse Possession**|It refers to the **hostile possession of the property**, where a person can become the **owner of the land if they possess it openly and continuously** for a specified period of time. The concept stems from the idea that **land must not be left vacant but instead, be put to judicious use.**|
|**Example**|**If Person A neglects their land, Person B** can take care of it and treat it as their own. If Person B remains unchallenged on the land for the required period, they may claim legal ownership through adverse possession.|
|**Origin**|The concept **dates back to ancient times** and has its roots in the development of **statutes of limitation in England**.|
|**Legal Provision**|**The Limitation Act of 1963** shifted the burden of proof to the person claiming adverse possession. **Possession for 12 years on private land or 30 years on government land** can lead to ownership.|
|**Supreme Court’s View**|The Supreme Court recommended changes to the law, considering it harsh for true owners and a windfall for dishonest individuals. It burdens the courts and promotes false claims without hindering rights or neglecting land resources.|
|**SC Test for ‘Adverse Possession’ (2004)**|To claim adverse possession, a person must show the **date of possession, nature of possession, whether the other party knew about it, how long the possession has continued, and that it was open and undisturbed.**|

 **Context:** The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has released a draft of ‘Master Directions on Cyber Resilience and Digital Payment Security Controls for Payment System Operators.

**What are Payment System Operators (PSOs)?**

Payment System Operators (PSOs) are entities that facilitate the movement of funds between payers and payees in electronic payment systems. They provide the necessary infrastructure and technology to enable various payment transactions, such as online payments, card payments, mobile payments, and electronic fund transfers.

**Examples: P**opular PSOs like **PayPal, RuPay, Visa, Mastercard, and Paytm** act as intermediaries in processing and settling payments between buyers and sellers in online transactions.

**About the guidelines:**

- The proposed guidelines require PSOs to **implement inventory management**, approved cybersecurity measures, and crisis management plans, and comply with Basel standards.
- PSOs will have to **report any unusual incident** including those involving cyber-attacks, internal fraud etc. to RBI **within six hours of detection**.
- Provisions of these directions shall apply to **all authorised non-bank PSOs**.
- **The Board of PSOs** has been made responsible for ensuring adequate oversight over information

**Aim of the guidelines:** These measures are intended to **improve cyber safety and protect digital payment systems.**

 **Context:** According to a report by the [LDC](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/14/least-developed-country-status/) Group at the [World Trade Organization](https://www.insightsonindia.com/international-relations/important-international-institutions-agencies-and-further-structure-mandate-etc/wto/) (WTO), approximately **85% of the 11,000 products offered** at zero tariffs by India to least developed countries (LDCs) under the duty-free quota-free (DFQF) scheme remain unutilized.

**About the duty-free quota-free (DFQF) scheme :**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Aspect**|**Information**|
|**About the scheme**|The Scheme requires **all developed and developing country members** to provide preferential market access for all products originating from all LDCs.|
|**Origin**|The decision to provide duty-free quota-free (DFQF) access for LDCs was first taken at the **WTO Hong Kong Ministerial Meeting in 2005.**|
|**India**|India became the **first developing country to extend this facility to LDCs** in 2008, providing market access to **85% of India’s total tariff lines** to better integrate LDCs into the global trading system and improve their trading opportunities.|
|**Expansion**|The scheme was expanded in 2014, providing preferential market access on over **98% of India’s tariff lines to LDCs**. India offers 11,506 preferential tariff lines to LDCs, of which 10,991 are duty-free.|
|**Reasons for low utilization**|Lack of awareness among exporters about the scheme and its benefits.|
|Incomplete or inaccurate data regarding utilization rates.|
|Significant amounts of LDC exports entering India under non-preferential (most favoured nation) tariff route, despite being covered by DFQF.|

### [WHO: Guidelines to protect children from the harmful effects of food marketing](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/05/who-guidelines-to-protect-children-from-the-harmful-effects-of-food-marketing/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus: Science and Technology/ Government Policies: Health**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/food/who-releases-policy-recommendations-to-protect-children-from-harmful-effects-of-food-marketing-90393#:~:text=The%20World%20Health%20Organization%20(WHO,that%20promote%20unhealthy%20dietary%20choices.)

 **Context:** The World Health Organization (WHO) has released **new guidelines to protect children from the harmful effects** of food marketing that promotes unhealthy dietary choices.

**Need for the guidelines:**

In 2017, to understand the linkages between food and NCDs, the Delhi-based think tank Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) conducted the [Know your diet — school children survey](http://cdn.cseindia.org/attachments/0.37055100_1520598445_burden-packaged-food-school-children.pdf). The survey found that

- **Most schoolchildren were not eating a balanced diet**
- Children had a low frequency of intake of cereals, vegetables and millet
- **Packaged food was more popular** among children than non-packaged food

**Previous guidelines:**

- 2010 WHO [‘Set of recommendations on the marketing of foods and non-alcoholic beverages to children](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241500210)
- In March 2023, WHO published a set of nutritional criteria which **aimed to protect children from marketing that promoted unhealthy food and non-alcoholic beverages.**

**The recommendations include:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Recommendations**|**Description**|
|**Implement comprehensive mandatory policies**|Protect children of all ages from the marketing of foods and non-alcoholic beverages that are high in saturated fatty acids, trans-fatty acids, free sugars, and/or salt through the implementation of comprehensive mandatory policies.|
|**Restrict marketing of unhealthy foods**|Restrict the marketing of specific unhealthy food categories to children, including high in saturated fatty acids, trans-fatty acids, free sugars and/or salt (HFSS), fast food, etc.|
|**Address marketing in various settings**|Address food marketing in locations where children frequently gather, such as schools and sports clubs. Also, regulate marketing during children’s television viewing times, in digital spaces popular among young people, and in magazines targeting children and adolescents.|
|**Consider country context**|Take into account the country’s nutritional situation, cultural context, locally available foods, dietary customs, available resources and capacities, and existing governance structures while formulating policies.|
|**Use a nutrient profile model**|Encourage countries to use a nutrient profile model to identify and classify unhealthy foods and beverages that should be subject to marketing restrictions.|
|**Minimize migration of marketing**|Design policies that are comprehensive enough to minimize the migration of marketing across different channels or settings.|
|**Protect all children**|Emphasize the protection of all children, using the definition of a child from the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The guidelines aim to ensure that marketing regulations apply uniformly to children of all ages, including **younger and older children, to safeguard their health and well-being.**|
|**Establish strong and comprehensive regulations**|Encourage governments to establish robust and comprehensive regulations to address the aggressive and pervasive marketing of foods and beverages high in fats, sugars, and salt to children.|

**Harmful Effects of Eating Non-nutritious Food for Children:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
||**Examples**|
|**Nutritional deficiencies**|Lack of essential vitamins, minerals, and nutrients necessary for growth and development.|
|**Childhood obesity**|Excessive consumption of sugary snacks, fast food, and sugar-sweetened beverages leads to weight gain and obesity.|
|**Increased risk of chronic diseases**|Consumption of high-fat, high-sugar, and high-sodium foods is associated with an increased risk of developing chronic conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension.|
|**Poor cognitive function and academic performance**|Inadequate intake of nutrient-rich foods can impair brain development, leading to poor cognitive function and reduced academic performance.|
|**Dental health problems**|Frequent consumption of sugary foods and beverages can contribute to tooth decay and cavities.|
|**Disrupted eating habits and food preferences**|Exposure to unhealthy food marketing can influence children’s food preferences, leading to a preference for unhealthy, non-nutritious foods.|
|**Negative impact on overall health and well-being**|Non-nutritious food can contribute to low energy levels, fatigue, poor immune function, and a general decline in overall health and well-being.|
|**Development of unhealthy dietary patterns and lifelong habits**|Regular consumption of non-nutritious food during childhood can establish unhealthy dietary patterns that persist into adulthood, leading to long-term health consequences.|
|**Decreased consumption of nutrient-dense foods**|Non-nutritious food choices often replace nutrient-dense options, resulting in a reduced intake of essential vitamins, minerals, and dietary fibre.|
|**Emotional and psychological effects**|Unhealthy food consumption can contribute to emotional issues like low self-esteem, poor body image, and negative relationships with food.|
