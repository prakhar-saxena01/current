### [State Election Commission (SEC)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/23/state-election-commission-sec/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: Constitutional Bodies**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/sec-accountable-for-all-blood-shed-during-panchayat-polls-says-wb-governor/article66997962.ece#:~:text=West%20Bengal%20Governor%20C.V.,is%20shed%20in%20the%20field.)

 **Context:** West Bengal Governor C.V. Ananda Bose holds the **State Election Commission (SEC) accountable for the violence occurring** during the ongoing panchayat poll process in the state.

**Recent tussle between West Bengal CM and Governor:**

- The Governor’s recent actions, **including returning the joining report of SEC Rajiva Sinha**, have triggered a **constitutional crisis**.
- Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee **ruled out the possibility of removing the SEC** and emphasized the peaceful nature of the elections.
- Last year, then-**governor Jagdeep Dhankhar was accused of delaying bills** and interfering in matters of administration by the West Bengal Government.
- **Also, Bengal passed a Bill replacing Governor with CM** as state university Chancellor

**About State Election Commissions (SECs):**

|   |   |
|---|---|
||**Description**|
|**About**|The SEC is responsible for **conducting free, fair, and impartial elections to the local bodies within a state.**|
|**Appointment of SECs**|**Appointed by the Governor.**|
|**Powers: Article 243K(1)**|It vests the **superintendence, direction, and control of the preparation of electoral rolls** and the conduct of elections to Panchayats (Municipalities under Article 243ZA) in the State Election Commission, headed by a **State Election Commissioner appointed by the Governor.**|
|**Tenure: Article 243K(2)**|It states that **the tenure and appointment of the State Election Commissioner will be directed by the law** made by the **state legislature**.|
|**Removal**|The State Election Commissioner has the **status, salary and allowance of a Judge of a High Court** and cannot be removed from office except in like manner and **on the like grounds as a Judge of a High Court**.|

**Issues with SECs:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
||**Examples**|
|**Violence during elections**|E.g., West Bengal Governor blames SEC for violence during recent panchayat polls|
|**State government interference**|This is despite the fact that under the constitutional mandate, **it is the duty of the State to not interfere with the functioning** of the State Election Commission|
|**Lack of impartiality and Questionable accountability**|Often SECs have been found to be **hand in glove with the state government.**|
|**Appointment of serving bureaucrats**|In this regard, SC has observed that This is necessary because giving government employees the additional charge of **State Election Commissioners is a “mockery of the Constitution”.**|
|**Challenges to independence**|**Tenure and appointment of the State Election Commissioner are directed by the law** made by the **state legislature**.|
|**Conflicts with state government**|In Maharashtra (2008), then-**state election commissioner Nand Lal was arrested and sent to jail for two days in March 2008** after the Assembly found him guilty of breach of privilege in an alleged conflict over his jurisdiction and powers.|

**Suggestions for Reforms in SECs:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Supreme Court**|The Supreme Court in 2021 ruled that **serving bureaucrats must not be appointed as election commissioners** to ensure that the **independence of the office** of the election commissioner is not compromised.|
|**2nd ARC**|The 2nd ARC suggests that the State Election Commissioner should be appointed **by the Governor based on the recommendation of a collegium comprising the Chief Minister**, the Speaker of the State Legislative Assembly, and the Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly.|
|2nd ARC proposes the **establishment of an institutional mechanism to facilitate the coordination, s**haring of experiences, and resources between the Election Commission of India and the State Election Commissions.|
|**Law Commission 255th Report on Electoral Reforms**|The report recommends adding a **new sub-clause to Article 324 of the Constitution to establish a separate, independent, and permanent Secretariat for the Election Commission of India**, similar to the Lok Sabha/Rajya Sabha Secretariats under Article 98. Similar provisions can be made for the **State Election Commissions** to ensure autonomy and fair local body elections.|

### [Global Gender Gap Report 2023](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/23/global-gender-gap-report-2023/)

####  **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Issues Relating to Development and Management of Social Sector**

**Source:** [**ET**](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/india-climbs-eight-places-to-127-in-global-gender-index-says-wef-report/articleshow/101162655.cms)

 **Context:** According to the annual Gender Gap Report 2023 (17th edition) of the **World Economic Forum (WEF)**, India was ranked **127 out of 146 countries** in terms of gender parity – an improvement of 8 places from last year.

**The Global Gender Gap Report:**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/economic_.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/economic_.png)

- It is an annual index first published in **2006** by the WEF **to measure gender equality.**
- **It assesses countries** on how well they are dividing their resources and opportunities among their male and female populations, regardless of the overall levels of these resources and opportunities.
- It serves as a **catalyst** for greater awareness as well as greater exchange between policymakers.

**Highlights of the 2023 report:**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rank_country.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rank_country.png)

- **No country** has yet achieved full gender parity.
- For the 14th consecutive year, **Iceland (91.2%)** takes the top position. It also continues to be the **only country** to have closed more than 90% of its gender gap.
- **Gender parity in Europe (76.3%)** surpasses the parity level in North America (75%) this year to rank first of eight geographic regions.
- **Sub-Saharan Africa** ranks 6th (68.2%), slightly below the global weighted average score (68.3%).
- **Southern Asia (63.4%)** overtakes the **Middle East and North Africa (62.6%)** – the region furthest away from parity in 2023.

**Major challenge:**

- **The state of gender parity in the labour market** remains a major challenge.
- Not only has **women’s participation** in the labour market globally slipped, but other **markers of economic opportunity** have been showing substantive disparities between women and men.
- **For example,**
    - **Labour markets of the future:** Women remain significantly underrepresented (29.2%) in the **STEM workforce**.
    - **Skills of the future:** Women do not have equal opportunities and access to **online learning platforms**, given the persistent **digital divide.**

**Performance of India:**

- **The country had improved** by 1.4 percentage points and 8 positions since the last edition and had **closed 64.3% of the overall gender gap**.
- The country had attained **parity in enrolment** across all levels of education.
- **On political empowerment**, India has registered 25.3% parity, with women representing 15.1% of parliamentarians – the highest for the country since the inaugural report in 2006.
    - This comes after the WEF recognised the need to enumerate women’s **participation in local government bodies** in its Gender Gap Report after the Indian government raised the issue.

**Performance of India’s neighbours:** Pakistan at 142, Bangladesh at 59, China at 107, Nepal at 116, Sri Lanka at 115 and Bhutan at 103.

**Challenges for India:**

- India had reached only 36.7% parity in **economic participation and opportunity.**
- While there had been an uptick in parity in wages and income, **the share of women in senior positions and technical roles had dropped** slightly since the last edition.
- The relatively low overall rankings on the Health and Survival sub-index are explained by **skewed sex ratios at birth.**

**Way ahead:**

- **Implementing a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) programme**.
- **Increasing women’s economic participation and achieving gender parity in leadership** (both business and government).
- **Collective, coordinated and bold action** by private and public sector leaders will be instrumental in accelerating progress towards gender parity.

**Conclusion:**

The gender parity globally has recovered to pre-Covid levels but the pace of change has stagnated as converging crises slow progress.

### [Issues with the climate finance mechanisms](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/23/issues-with-the-climate-finance-mechanisms/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus:** **Effect of Policies and Politics of Developed and Developing Countries on India’s Interests**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/who-pays-for-the-clean-up-eus-carbon-border-adjustment-mechanism-flies-in-face-of-wto-regulations-8678439/lite/)

 **Context:** The industrialised countries have not walked the talk of financing the climate mitigation and adaptation efforts of the poorer countries.

**Why does the burden lie on industrialised countries? Historical responsibility**

- A bulk of the accumulated GHGs, the reason for global warming, **have come from a group of about 40 rich and industrialised countries**, usually referred to as **Annex I countries** in the 1992 UNFCCC.
- The contribution of the poorer countries (the **Global South**) was negligible.
- Additionally, countries in the Global South were already **struggling to pay their external debt**, exacerbated by the pandemic.

**Mechanisms that made industrialised countries liable:**

- **The Kyoto Protocol** (1997) recognised the “common but differentiated responsibilities” in the fight against climate change.
- **The Paris Agreement** (2015) asked countries **to set voluntary emission targets** but required the richer countries to make financial transfers to the developing economies.
    - It set a floor of **$100 billion per year** (that the developed countries had committed to raising from 2020) for these transfers.

**Concerns:**

- In the definition of climate finance, **commercial loans should not be counted.**
- In 2020, **$83 billion was paid into the climate finance** fund to be transferred to the countries of the Global South.
- Out of this, **less than $25 billion was in the form of grants**.

**Recent efforts to boost climate finance:**

- [**New Global Financing Pact**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/21/new-global-financing-pact/)
- The EU has put forward a proposal, called the [**Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/09/eus-carbon-border-tax-2/).

**CBAM:**

- This involves **imposing tariffs** on imports from other countries that are seen to be using carbon-intensive methods of production.
- This mechanism, starting in **2026**, will cover products such as cement, steel, aluminium, oil refinery, paper, glass, chemicals and electricity generation.

**The CBAM is expected to achieve three objectives**: Reduce the EU’s emissions, for the EU not lose competitiveness in carbon-intensive goods and to make the targeted countries reduce the carbon intensity of their exports.

**Issues with CBAM:**

- **The CBAM is a unilateral move**, against the spirit of **multilateralism**.
- It could be used for **protectionism**.
- **Equity considerations**, are designed to help rich countries avoid paying for creating the climate problem.
- It targets **production processes** (not the product itself) that the WTO does not approve of.

**How will it affect the Global South?** This mechanism seeks to penalise **“free riders”** – one who is not contributing, although has the means to do so.

**Most affected:**

- Only 3 of the 12 exporters to the EU have a mechanism for “pricing carbon”.
- The countries most affected will be **Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, India and China**.

**Way ahead:**

- **A global price for carbon to redress the global “externality”.**
- Clarity on the following before CBAM is implemented:
    - **First, which countries will be exempt?** These are likely to be those that possibly have a national emissions cap or a sectoral cap or are the poorest countries.
    - **Second, which emissions are included in the levying of the import tax?**
    - **Finally, which products are to be included?** Possibly, a narrow coverage with high trade and carbon exposure.

### [Organic and natural farming in India](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/23/organic-and-natural-farming-in-india/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Agriculture and related issues**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/agriculture/market-access-critical-for-india-s-sustainable-agri-transition-cse-report-90208)

 **Context:** According to a CSE report, **market access is critical for the success of India’s momentum towards organic and natural farming,** which are good for the farmer, nature and human health**.**

**[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/comp_bet.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/comp_bet.png)**

**About the CSE report:** The report highlights **how various stakeholders procure, process and sell** organic and natural produce while trying to ensure remunerative prices to farmers.

**Challenges faced by farmers:**

- **Lack of market access** → unable to sell their produce at a remunerative price.
- **Lack of certification** → detrimental to demands (domestic and exports) → becoming a barrier in India’s journey towards non-chemical farming practices.
- Organic farmers don’t get all the benefits conventional farmers get in terms of **subsidies**.

**Way ahead:**

- Working with consumers for **behavioural change** towards organic produce (as in the case of millet).
- **Coherence in the different certification systems** like Participatory Guarantee System (PGS) and third-party National Programme for Organic Production (NPOP) certification.
- **Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs)** need government support for working capital, dedicated infrastructure and support for capacity building.
- **Expand value addition and move towards shorter supply chains** for better price realisation by farmers.

**Some best practices from Himachal Pradesh:**

- **Prakritak Kheti Khushhal Kisan Yojana:** To increase agricultural income by adopting **ZBNF**. The system will not only improve soil fertility but also discourage the use of fertilisers and pesticides and reduce environmental pollution.
- **Subsidy:** To promote organic farming in the state, the state government is providing a 50% subsidy to farmers for setting up vermicompost units.

**Conclusion: Unless farmers get assured access to the market** to sell their produce at a remunerative price, the challenge of transition will remain difficult to overcome.

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/pm-modi-biden-yeats-ten-principal-upanishads-8680613/)

 **Context:** Prime Minister Narendra Modi gifted US President Joe Biden a **first edition print of the book “The Ten Principal Upanishads” (1937)** during his visit to the White House.

**About the Book:**

The book was translated from **Sanskrit by Shri Purohit Swami**, a scholar of Hindu scripture, and **Irish poet WB Yeats**. Yeats had a lifelong fascination with **Indian philosophy and literature, and his interest in the Upanishads** led to the co-translation. The book is considered one of the **best translations**, aiming to retain the **original text’s essence** while being accessible to the general reader.

**About Hindu Scriptures**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|There are broadly **two categories of Hindu sacred texts:**|   |
|**Shruti (revealed)**|Considered **authoritative**; Includes the **four Vedas** (Rig, Yajur, Sama, and Atharva) and accompanying texts; **Contains Brahmanas** (ritual texts), **Aranyakas** (“forest” or “wilderness” texts), and **Upanishads** (philosophical texts)|
|||
|||
|**Smriti (to be remembered)**|Less authoritative than shruti; Derived from shruti; Includes epics like Ramayana and Mahabharata, Dharmashastras, Puranas, and post-Vedic scriptures|
|**What are Upanishads?**|The Upanishads (also known as the Vedanta) are important Hindu religious texts that speculate on the connection between the **atman**, or the distinct, unchanging self of an individual, and the **brahman**, the ultimate reality in the universe.|
|**Ten principals of Upanishads**|Esha, Kena, Katha, Prashna, Mundaka, Mandukya, Taittiriya, Aitareya, Chandogya, Brihadaranyaka|

**About Yeats**

William Butler Yeats (1865-1939) was an Irish poet, dramatist, writer and politician. One of the foremost figures of 20th-century literature, he was a driving force behind the **Irish Literary Revival. WB Yeats’ connection to India** can be seen through his friendship with Rabindranath Tagore and his earlier poems inspired by India.

 **Yeats wrote three poems** (published in 1889) that referred to India:

- ‘The Indian to His Love’
- ‘The Indian upon God’
- ‘Anushuya and Vijaya’.

- Dr Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar (1891-1956) lived in the house **during 1921-22**

**More about the News:**

The Ministry of External Affairs has expressed its desire to take over the museum and transform it into an **autonomous unit**. The central government intends to enhance the **museum’s operations and establish it as an autonomous unit**, with a director appointed by the Indian government.

The director would report to the **Director of the Nehru Centre**, the cultural wing of the High Commission of India in the United Kingdom. The move aims to promote a broader **understanding of Babasaheb Ambedkar’s work and involve Indian students** studying in London.

The **current maintenance of the property is funded by the Maharashtra government** through the High Commission of India. The property was purchased by the **Maharashtra government in 2015 to preserve it as a historically important monument**.

**Context:**  Prime Minister Narendra Modi gifted a **7.5-carat lab-grown diamond** to U.S. First Lady Jill Biden during his state visit. The diamond was manufactured in a **Surat factory in Gujarat**, using a process that replicates the formation of natural diamonds beneath the earth’s surface.

**More about the LGD:**

- **India is a leading player in growing lab-grown diamonds**, with exports reaching over **$1.67 billion**.
- Lab-grown diamonds offer a more affordable alternative to natural diamonds and are considered eco-friendly.
- They are around **20% cheaper than their naturally-formed equivalent**
- India is the largest producer of lab-grown diamonds through **CVD technology** and contributes to nearly **25% of global LGD production through CVD technology**.
- But overall, India accounts for **15% of the global production of LGD**

**Source:** [**DST**](https://dst.gov.in/new-low-cost-technology-reduces-textile-effluent-pollution-significantly)

 **Context**: Researchers from **NIT Warangal and Prime Textiles**, with support from **IMPRINT**, have developed a **low-cost and eco-friendly technology** to treat textile wastewater.

The technology combines **biosurfactants**, **cavitation**, and **membrane processes** to effectively remove pollutants from the effluent.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Technology**|**Description**|
|**Biosurfactants**|Biosurfactants are **surface-active compounds produced by microorganisms**. In the context of wastewater treatment, biosurfactants are used to **aid in the removal of dyes from textile effluent.**|
|**Cavitation**|Cavitation is a process in which **pressure variations in a liquid create countless small cavities that rapidly form and implode**. In wastewater treatment, cavitation is employed as an advanced oxidation process (AOP) to destroy various types of pollutants. It helps in reducing installation costs and carbon footprint.|
|**Membrane Processes**|Membrane processes involve the use of **selectively permeable membranes** to separate contaminants from water or wastewater. In the case of textile effluent treatment, the membrane is **modified to decrease pore size and enhance performance**. It effectively separates pollutants, resulting in cleaner water.|

### [The Electricity (Rights of Consumers) Rules](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/26/the-electricity-rights-of-consumers-rules/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Infrastructure (Energy)**

**Source:** [**PIB**](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1934673) 

**Context:** The government has amended the Electricity (Rights of Consumers) Rules 2020 to empower power consumers, ensure a 24X7 reliable electricity supply at affordable cost, etc.

**The Electricity (Rights of Consumers) Rules 2020:**

- The Ministry of Power has promulgated the Rules under **the Electricity Act, 2003**.
- These rules shall **empower the consumers of electricity** as the consumers have the right to get **reliable services and quality electricity**.

**Rights and obligations under the Rules:**

- It is the **duty of every distribution licensee** to supply electricity on request made by an owner or occupier of any premises in line with the provisions of the Act.
- It is the **right of consumers** to have minimum standards of service for the supply of electricity from the distribution licensee.

**The changes made in the Rules:**

- Introduction of **Time of Day (ToD) Tariff**, and
- Rationalisation of smart metering provisions.

**Introduction of Time of Day (ToD) Tariff:**

- Rather than being charged for electricity at the same rate at all times of the day, **there will be separate tariffs for peak hours, solar hours and normal hours.**
- **Tariffs during solar hours** (8 hours in a day as specified by the State Electricity Regulatory Commission) shall be 10%-20% less than the normal tariff.
- **Tariffs during peak hours** will be 10 to 20% higher.
- It shall be made effective immediately after the **installation of smart metres**, for the consumers without smart metres.

**Applicable for:**

- **Commercial and Industrial consumers** have Maximum demand of 10 KW and above, from 1st April 2024 and
- **For all other consumers except agricultural consumers**, latest from 1st April 2025.

**Significance:**

- The ToD is **a win-win** for consumers as well as the power system.
- **For consumers:**
    - **The separate tariffs will send price signals to consumers** to manage their load according to the Tariff.
    - With awareness and effective utilisation of the ToD tariff mechanism, **consumers can reduce their electricity bills**.
- **For the power system:** The ToD mechanism will also ensure **better grid integration** of Renewable Energy sources thereby facilitating **faster energy transition** for India.

**Current status of ToD mechanism:**

- **In India:** Most of the State Electricity Regulatory Commissions (SERCs) have **already implemented ToD tariffs for the large Commercial and Industrial category of consumers**.
    - Various statutory provisions already exist to enable and promote the implementation of ToD tariffs (i.e. Tariff Policy 2016, Electricity Act 2003 and National Electricity Policy 2005).
- **Globally:** It is recognised across electricity industries, as an important **Demand Side Management (DSM)** measure to reduce the demand during peak periods.

**Amendment in smart metering provision:**

- The government has **simplified the rules for smart metering**.
- To avoid inconvenience/harassment of the consumers, **the existing penalties for an increase in consumer demand beyond the maximum sanctioned load/demand have been reduced.**
- Post installation of a smart metre, **no penal charges will be imposed on a consumer** based on the maximum demand recorded by the smart metre for the period before the installation date.
