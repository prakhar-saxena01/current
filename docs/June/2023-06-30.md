### [Will the Indian Ocean Dipole save the monsoon?](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/30/will-the-indian-ocean-dipole-save-the-monsoon/)

#### **GS Paper 1**

 **Syllabus: Indian Geography: Monsoon**

**Source:** [**TOI**](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-editorials/will-the-indian-ocean-dipole-save-the-monsoon/#:~:text=The%20honest%20answer%20is%20%E2%80%93%20not%20really.)**,** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/indian-ocean-dipole-what-is-it-how-it-can-limit-el-nino-effects-8689360/)

 **Context:** The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) predicts a normal monsoon despite the possibility of an [El Nino event.](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/15/el-nino-and-monsoon/)

**What is Monsoon and El Nino?**

- **Monsoon**: A seasonal reversal of wind system that brings heavy rainfall, especially in the Indian subcontinent. The Indian summer monsoon **affects a vast region spanning 25 countries and covering a distance of 18,000 kilometres** from east to west and 6,000 kilometres from south to north.
- [**El Nino**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/15/el-nino-and-monsoon/): A climate pattern characterized by warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean, which can have widespread impacts on weather patterns around the world.

**Factors that can impact the monsoon rains:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Factors**|**Impact on Monsoon**|
|**El Nino/La Nina**|El Nino can lead to **weaker monsoons**, while La Nina can enhance it.|
|**Dateline El Nino or a Central Pacific El Nino**|It is considered to have a **larger negative impact** on the monsoon, but an exception was the 2005 El Nino.|
|**Atlantic Nino**|It is the **east-west anomaly pattern in the tropical Atlantic Ocean**. It also influences the monsoon.|
|**Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)**|Positive IOD can enhance monsoon, while negative IOD can weaken it.|
|**Sea Surface Temperatures**|Warmer sea surface temperatures can enhance monsoon, while cooler temperatures can weaken it.|
|**Atmospheric Pressure**|Changes in atmospheric pressure patterns can affect monsoon circulation and rainfall patterns.|
|**Land-Sea Temperature Contrast**|Greater contrast between land and sea temperatures can influence monsoon strength and rainfall distribution.|
|**Himalayan Mountain Range**|The presence of the Himalayas can influence monsoon winds and rainfall patterns in the Indian subcontinent.|
|**Topography**|The shape and elevation of landforms can impact local wind patterns and rainfall distribution.|
|**Tropical Cyclones**|The occurrence and track of tropical cyclones can influence monsoon rainfall, especially in coastal regions.|
|**Global Climate Patterns**|Variations in global climate patterns, such as the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), can affect monsoon dynamics.|
|**Local Factors**|Factors like local vegetation, soil moisture, and land use changes can also impact monsoon conditions at a regional level.|

**What is the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)?**

IOD is a **climate phenomenon in the Indian Ocean** characterized by the fluctuation of sea surface temperatures and atmospheric pressure between its eastern and western parts. The IOD is similar in nature to the **El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon** in the Pacific Ocean but on a smaller scale.

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IOD.jpg)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IOD.jpg)**

**How the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) can affect the monsoon:**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) Phase**|**Impact on Monsoon**|**Example**|
|**Positive IOD**|Enhances monsoon rainfall over the Indian subcontinent|In 1997, a positive IOD offset the impact of El Nino, resulting in above-normal monsoon rainfall.|
|**Negative IOD**|Weakens monsoon rainfall over the Indian subcontinent|In 2019, a negative IOD contributed to deficient monsoon rainfall, particularly during the first month of the monsoon season.|
|**Neutral IOD**|Minimal or neutral impact on the monsoon|A neutral IOD does not significantly influence the monsoon and allows other factors to play a more dominant role.|

**The Earth System Science Organisation (ESSO) and the IMD take into account five conditions while making forecasts about the monsoon in April every year.**

**1) The Sea Surface Temperature (SST) gradient** between the North Atlantic and the North Pacific (conditions during December of the previous year and January of the present year)  
**2) SST of the equatorial south Indian Ocean** (conditions during February and March of the present year)  
**3) Mean Sea Level pressure in East Asia** (conditions during February and March of the present year)  
**4) The surface air temperature over northwest Europe** (conditions during January of the present year)  
**5) The warm water volume of the equatorial Pacific Ocean** (conditions during February and March of the present year)

**What are the limitations of forecasting El Nino and IOD?**

- **For the IOD and Atlantic Nino,** forecasting models currently lack the reliability to accurately predict their occurrence and behaviour. As a result, their specific role in influencing monsoon patterns in a particular season remains uncertain.
- **When it comes to forecasting El Nino events**, models face challenges in precisely predicting the location and intensity of warming during the early stages.

### [How does climate affect social issues?](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/30/how-does-climate-affect-social-issues/)

#### **GS Paper 1**

 **Syllabus:** **Indian society**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/climate-change/domestic-violence-to-rise-as-subcontinent-heats-up-study-90313)

 **Context:** According to a study, **domestic violence will rise as temperatures across the Indian subcontinent spike.**

**Findings of the study:**

- These findings highlight the **vulnerabilities and inequalities of women experiencing** **Intimate Partner Violence** (IPV) in low- and middle-income countries in the context of **global climate warming**.
- High ambient temperature may be associated with the **risk of IPV against women**. Each 1°C increase in the annual mean temperature is associated with a mean increase in IPV prevalence of 4.49%.
- **The prevalence of physical violence was highest** (23.0%), followed by emotional and sexual violence.

**How does global warming increase IPV prevalence?**

- Increasing temperature is
    - **Squeezing working hours** → impacting the income of **daily wage** earners → Family members **spend maximum time within the house** → _increasing the workload for women_.
    - **Generating requirements for comfort** which low-income groups and economically weaker sections cannot afford.
    - Directly impacting mental health.
- All of this is contributing to domestic violence.

**Challenges ahead: The IPV prevalence would increase by 21% by the end of the 21st century** under unlimited emissions scenarios.

**Case of India:**

- This comes as India witnessed several **heat-related deaths** with temperatures up to 45 degrees Celsius in certain parts of the country.
- India is likely to experience the **highest** IPV prevalence increase (23.5%) in the 2090s, followed by Nepal and Pakistan.

**Way ahead:**

- **Climate action** is an essential component in the ongoing fight to eliminate violence against women and girls.
    - **For example, under stricter emissions-cut scenarios**, the IPV prevalence would only moderately increase.
- **The world also needs greater involvement of women in climate action** → gender mainstreaming in the policymaking process.
    - UNICEF’s **Gender Action Plan (GAP)** and the **Lima work programme on Gender** (LWGP adopted at UNFCCC’s COP 20) are efforts in this direction.

**Conclusion:** Tackling the issue of violence against women and girls is an important step towards achieving the core objective of the **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**, which is to leave no one behind.

### [Challenges Faced by India’s bioeconomy](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/30/challenges-faced-by-indias-bioeconomy/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Biotechnology**

 **Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/genetically-engineered-insects-dbt-guidelines-problems-uncertainty/article67014161.ece)

 **Context:** India’s bioeconomy growth is not in sync with desired funding and policy support.

**Bioeconomy:** It is the economic activity involving the use of biotechnology and biomass in the production of goods, services, or energy.

**[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chain.png)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chain.png)**

**India’s bioeconomy:**

- According to the DBT’s ‘Bioeconomy Report 2022’ report, **India’s bioeconomy contributes 2.6% to the GDP** and by 2030 it will be ~5% of the GDP.
- **This ambitious leap** of $220 billion in eight years **will require aggressive investment and policy support.**

**Concerns:**

- **Neither funding for the DBT nor its recent policies** reflect any serious intention to uplift this sector.
- **For example,**
    - The current Budgetary allocation to the DBT is **only 0.0001% of India’s GDP.**
    - Also, **policies** that enable risk-taking appetite within Indian scientists to create an ecosystem of innovation and industrial action, **are missing**.
    - Also, the **alignment between biotechnology policies and economic goals** is missing.

**Case study – Problems in the Guidelines for Genetically Engineered (GE) Insects:**

- **Uncertainty of purpose**
    - The guidelines emphasise that GE insects **offer applications in various fields** (such as human and livestock health; crop management; etc) **uplifting the standard of living** by
        - Reducing disease burden,
        - Enabling food security and
        - Conserving the environment.
    - However, the guidelines **don’t specify the purposes for which GE insects may be approved in India**.
    - The guidelines **only provide regulatory procedures for R&D on insects** with some beneficial applications.
- **Uncertainty for researchers:**
    - The guidelines are **applicable only to research and not to confined trials or deployment.**
    - Once the insects are ‘made’ and tested in the laboratory, researchers can conduct trials with them on the approval of the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) of the MoEFCC.
    - Once deployed, **GE insects can’t be recalled and unlike GM foods they are not amenable to individual consumer choice**.
- **Uncertainty of ambit:**
    - The guidelines offer standard operating procedures for GE mosquitoes, crop pests, and beneficial insects – **but what ‘beneficial’ means, in the context of GE insects, is not clear**.
    - The lack of clarity will impede funders and scientists from investing in this research.

**Way ahead:**

- **Further efforts are needed to attract private funding** for biotechnology R&D.
- **Policies need to be significantly revised** if biotechnology is to be of any serious consequence to the economy.
- Both of the above are essential considering the **importance of biotechnology to any pandemic preparedness efforts.**

#### **GS4/GS2**

**Syllabus: Application of Ethics/ Government Policies and Related Issues**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/animal-trials-drug-development-india-amendment-2019-rules/article67019288.ece#:~:text=A%20new%20Rule%20authorises%20researchers,methods%20to%20test%20new%20drugs.&text=Photo%20Credit%3A%20AFP-,An%20amendment%20to%20the%20New%20Drugs%20and%20Clinical%20Trial%20Rules,research%2C%20especially%20in%20drug%20testing.)**,** [**BBC**](https://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/animals/using/experiments_1.shtml)

Context: The government of India recently passed **an amendment to the New Drugs and Clinical Trial Rules (2023)** that permits researchers to utilize **non-animal and human-relevant methods** for testing the safety and effectiveness of new drugs.

- It will amend the **Drugs and Clinical Trials Rules, 2019**

**The use of animals in drug testing has limitations:**  

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Limitations**|**Description**|**Example**|
|**Limited predictability for human response**|Animals may respond differently to drugs compared to humans due to **differences in biological processes, genetics, and other factors**.|The **drug Thalidomide** caused severe birth defects in humans but **did not produce the same effects in animal tests**, leading to tragic consequences.|
|**Ethical Concerns and animal welfare**|Animal testing involves the **use of sentient beings and raises ethical concerns regarding the suffering and harm caused to animals**. This includes procedures such as **force-feeding, injections, and euthanasia.**|The **Draize test**, which involves applying substances to animals’ eyes, has been criticized for causing severe pain and distress.|
|**The high failure rate in translating to human efficacy**|Despite passing animal testing, many drugs fail during human clinical trials, leading to wasted resources and potential harm to human participants.|For instance, a study published in the British Medical Journal found that **over 90% of drugs tested on animals fail** to translate into safe and effective treatments for humans.|
|**Inadequate representation of human diversity**|Animals used in testing may not accurately represent the diversity of human populations in terms of age, sex, genetic variations, and underlying health conditions.|For example, the drug **Ximelagatran** showed promise in animal studies but caused **liver damage in humans**, highlighting the need for more accurate models.|
|**Regulatory and legal considerations**|The use of animals in testing is subject to regulatory requirements and ethical considerations, which can lead to delays, increased costs, and challenges in obtaining approvals.|The **European Union has implemented a ban on animal testing for cosmetics.**|

**Ethical Issues Related to the Use of Animals in drug testing:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Ethical Dilemma**|**Description**|
|**Animal Suffering**|Animal experimentation often involves causing pain, distress, or harm to the animals, raising concerns about their welfare and the ethics of inflicting suffering on them.|
|**Moral Status of Animals**|The debate centres around the **moral consideration and rights of animals**. Some argue that **animals have inherent value and should not be subjected to experimentation**, while others believe that human benefits justify their use.|
|**Balancing Human Benefits**|The dilemma arises when weighing the potential benefits to human health and well-being against the harm caused to animals. Ethical considerations involve determining **if the benefits are significant enough to justify the use of animals in experiments.**|
|**Informed Consent and Voluntary Participation**|Unlike human clinical trials where participants can provide informed consent, **animals have no agency or ability to voluntarily participate** in experiments, raising questions about the ethics of subjecting them to testing without their consent.|

**Steps by Other Countries:**

- **In 2021, the European Union**passed a resolution on an action plan to facilitate the transition towards technologies that don’t use animals in research, regulatory testing, and education. **The U.S. passed the FDA Modernization Act 2.0** in December 2022, allowing researchers to use these systems to **test the safety and efficacy of new drugs.**
- Also, in 2022, South Korea introduced a Bill called ‘**Vitalization of Development, Dissemination, and Use of Alternatives to Animal Testing Methods’**.
- In June 2023, **Canada amended its Environmental Protection Act** to replace, reduce or refine the use of vertebrate animals in toxicity testing.

**Conclusion:**

Thus the use of non-animal methods is significant for avoiding these ethical dilemmas. However, India faces challenges in terms of **interdisciplinary expertise and the availability of resources for research** in this area. Efforts are being made to establish **centres of excellence and develop an end-to-end ecosystem** in India to support the implementation of these new technologies.

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/explained-what-the-us-supreme-courts-ruling-on-affirmative-action-means-for-colleges/article67026125.ece)

The U.S. Supreme Court recently ruled to **strike down race-conscious policies** in college admissions, bringing an end to affirmative action in higher education. Affirmative action refers to admissions policies that **aim to increase the representation of minority students, such as Black and Hispanic students, on college campuses**.

Many colleges and universities consider **race as part of a holistic approach to admissions**, along with other factors like grades and extracurricular activities, to promote **diversity and enhance the educational experience**.

**Reason for such a decision**: US Supreme Court has **narrowly emphasized individual rights** and **equal treatment** over considerations of **historical disadvantage or societal diversity**.

**Impact**: The impact of this ruling will lead colleges to explore new strategies to ensure diversity in their student populations. Also, Indian Students will be affected as well.

Usage: The example can be used as a counterargument to affirmative policies in India.

 **Context**: The **United Nations (UN)** has **removed India from its annual list of countries** affected by **armed conflict children**, citing measures taken by the Indian government to better protect children.

- India was previously included in the list due **to allegations of recruitment of young boys by separatist militant groups in Jammu and Kashmir**, as well as accusations of detention of **young boys by Indian security forces.**

**More findings:**

- The UN Secretary-General’s report highlighted that the **highest number of violations against children occurred in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Israel, Palestine, Somalia, Syria, Ukraine, Afghanistan, and Yemen**.
- **Myanmar, South Sudan, and Burkina Faso** experienced the worst deterioration in the situation.

**Context**: A new certification scheme has been **launched in India** to promote responsible antibiotic manufacturing (first of its kind)

**About the Scheme:**

- **Developed by**: the **British Standards Institute** (BSI) (a business improvement and standards company) and the **AMR Industry Alliance** (one of the largest private sector coalitions that provide long-term solutions to antimicrobial resistance)
- **Aim**: To address **environmental concerns** related to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) by limiting the release of antibiotic residues into **waterways through industrial waste**.
- **Process**:
    - The certification process involves **third-party validation to** monitor environmental practices throughout the manufacturing process.
    - **Manufacturers must demonstrate effective** environmental management and **wastewater treatment systems** to obtain certification.
    - **The concentration of antibiotics** in waste streams must be below a specified threshold to prevent the emergence of AMR in the environment.
- **Time**: The certification is valid for three years, with annual surveillance to ensure ongoing compliance.

In 2022, The AMR Industry Alliance and BSI came up with a set of [**Antibiotic Manufacturing Standards**](https://www.amrindustryalliance.org/antibiotic-manufacturing-standard/) and launched the certification to ensure their implementation. The initiative is part of efforts to promote sustainable and responsible drug production while mitigating the environmental impact of antibiotic manufacturing.

 **Context:** A recent outbreak of algae bloom – commonly known as red tide – has sickened and killed an unknown number of sea lions and dolphins off the coast of California, US.

**Sea lions (IUCN Status – Endangered):**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/sea_lion.png)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/sea_lion.png)

- **They are pinnipeds characterised by** external ear flaps, long fore flippers, the ability to walk on all fours, short and thick hair and a big chest and belly.
- **Their range extends from the subarctic to tropical waters** of the global ocean in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, except the northern Atlantic Ocean.

**Algal bloom/red tides:**

- An algal bloom is a term used for the **excessive growth of algae** over a water body causing **discolouration** of the water body.
    - Blooms can proliferate because of human causes such as **climate change and an excess of nitrates** washed out to sea.
- **Red tide** is the red colouration of seawater due to the presence of **dinoflagellate Gonyaulax.**

**Impact:**

- Algal blooms cause the production of a **neurotoxin called domoic acid** and result in the **death of fish and other aquatic organisms.**
- Small fish consume the toxin and pass it up the **food chain**. Humans are unaffected unless they eat infected shellfish.
