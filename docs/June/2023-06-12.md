 **Context:** The WHO report highlights the significant impact of the ‘Har Ghar Jal’ program on public health and economic savings.

 **The focus of the report:** The ‘Har Ghar Jal’ report focuses on **diarrheal diseases** as they contribute significantly to the **overall disease burden related to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) issues.**

**Performance of the Har Ghar Jal program (as per the report):**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Dimensions**|**Observation**|**Impact**|
|**On Piped Water connection**|Currently, over **12 crore rural households, or 62%,** have piped water connections (from about **16% in 2019** when the scheme was launched)|No programme has **this kind of direct impact on** improving the lives of individuals and families physically, mentally, and financially.|
||**Five States including Gujarat, Telangana, Goa, Haryana, and Punjab and 3 Union Territories** — A& N, Daman Diu & Dadra Nagar Haveli and Puducherry have **reported 100% coverage.**<br><br>**Even the laggard states are doing well.** Himachal Pradesh (at about 99%), Bihar (at over 96%)|Seeing the success, the government has **claimed that it will achieve 100% coverage in all states by 2024**|
|**On Health impacts of the Har Ghar Jal program**|Ensuring safely managed drinking water **for all** could avert nearly **400,000 deaths caused by diarrheal diseases** and prevent approximately **14 million Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs)** related to these diseases.<br><br>***DALY** is a measure that shows the **impact of a disease or condition on a person’s health,** combining years lost due to premature death and years lived with a disability.|This achievement alone would result in estimated cost **savings of up to $101 billion.**<br><br>**Every dollar invested in sanitation** interventions gives a **$4.3 return** in the form of reduced healthcare costs|
|**On saving time and effort for women**|In 2018, households spent a staggering over 66 million hours each day collecting water, with the majority occurring in **rural areas**|Tremendous **time and effort have been saved** for women and girls through the provision of tap water|
|**On Safe water supply**|In 2018, **36% of India’s total population, including 44%** of the rural population, lacked access to improved drinking-water sources on their premises.|Unsafe drinking water, along with inadequate sanitation and hygiene, contributed to a number of deaths (esp. among children) and DALYs|

**About the ‘Har Ghar Jal’ programme** (also called Nal Se Jal Yojana):

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**About**|The ‘Har Ghar Jal’ programme aims to provide safe and affordable tap water connections **to every rural household in India.**|
|**Launched**|2019|
|**Implementation**|Under Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) (Ministry of Jal Shakti). The scheme is based on a **unique model where paani samitis (water committee)** comprising villagers will decide what they will pay for the water they consume.|
|**Aim**|Provide fully functional, **safe and affordable tap water connections** to every rural household in India by 2024|
||***Fully functional tap water** connection defined as a **household receiving at least 55 litres of per capita per day** of potable water throughout the year|

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Indian Economy and issues relating to Planning, Mobilisation of Resources**

 **Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/business/explained-why-is-the-markets-regulator-asking-for-more-disclosures-from-foreign-portfolio-investors/article66941630.ece#:~:text=Investors%20(FPIs).-,The%20objective%20is%20two%2Dfold%2C%20firstly%2C%20to%20guard%20against,3%20(updated%20April%202020).)

 **Context:** The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has proposed additional disclosures from Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs).

**FPI vs FDI (Foreign direct investment):**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fdi.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fdi.png)

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
||**FPI**|**FDI**|
|**Distinguishing features**|Does not give investors direct ownership of a company’s assets.|**Direct control/ownership in a business.**|
|**Definition of FPI and FDI as per Arvind Mayaram Committee (2014)**|FPI results in an investor controlling **less than 10%** **of the shares of the company.**|FDI results in an investor controlling **more than/equal to 10%** of the shares of the company.|

**FPI regulation in India:**

- FPIs are registered with **SEBI** and can invest in Indian securities as per the regulations prescribed by SEBI.
- **The Foreign Exchange Management Act 1999** (FEMA) is the primary legislation governing FPI in India and has been amended several times to liberalise FPI regulations in India.

**What are SEBI’s new proposals?**

- The proposed legislation **categorises FPIs into low risk, moderate risk and high risk**.
- **The low risk** would cover government and government-related entities such as central banks or sovereign wealth funds.
- **Moderate risk** refers to pension funds or public retail funds with widespread and dispersed investors.
- **All other FPIs are categorised as high-risk.**

**Proposals for high-risk FPIs:**

- **Additional disclosure requirements** for high-risk FPIs holding more than 50% of their equity asset under management (AUM) in a single corporate group.
- The existing high-risk FPIs with an overall holding in the Indian equity market of over Rs 25,000 crore **comply with the disclosure mandate within six months**.
    - Failing this, they would have to bring down their holding within the threshold.

**Exceptions:**

- **New FPIs** that have just begun investments would be allowed to breach the threshold criteria for up to a period of six months.
- **‘Moderate risk’ FPIs**, whose India-oriented holdings are relatively small in comparison to their global portfolio, are not subjected to additional disclosure requirements.

**Need of the proposed regulations:**

- **Potential misuse** of the FPI route for circumventing Press Note 3 stipulations (2020) that required an entity sharing a land border with India to involve in FPI only via the **government route**.
- **Concentrated group investments** by FPIs to **bypass** regulatory requirements (such as that for minimum public shareholding).

**Significance of the proposed regulations:**

- **They would try to identify tangible ownership** and curtail incidences of multiple routes.
- **This would enhance transparency and help avert regulatory requirements**, and keep up with the minimum (25%) public shareholding norms.

**Concerns:** A detract from ease-of-doing investments.

### [What is happening to Arctic Sea ice?](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/12/what-is-happening-to-arctic-sea-ice/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus: Environmental Pollution & Degradation, Conservation**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/explained-what-is-happening-to-arctic-sea-ice/article66955260.ece#:~:text=As%20the%20amount%20of%20sea,sea%20ice%20and%20further%20warming.%E2%80%9D)

 **Context:** According to a recent study published in the Nature Journal, the loss of Arctic Sea ice is expected to continue in the coming decades, even if carbon emissions are significantly reduced.

**What is Arctic Sea ice?**

Arctic sea ice refers to the frozen seawater that covers the Arctic Ocean and surrounding seas during the colder months. It spreads **over one-sixth of the earth’s landmass**.

**Status:**

Data from the **Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)** indicate that the annual mean of **Arctic Sea ice levels** has been the **lowest since at least 1850**, while late summer levels have hit the lowest point in at least 1,000 years. The IPCC predicts that the **Arctic will likely experience a practically ice-free September** at least once before 2050.

**The new findings:**

- **The world will see its first ‘sea-ice-free summer’**before 2050 (corroborating IPCC findings), possibly in the 2030s.
- **The global emissions** will drive temperatures to **beyond 4.5°C** making the Arctic ice-free by 2081-2100.
- There is **no scenario under which the Arctic Sea ice** can be saved in summer.

**Factors Causing Rapid Melting of Ice:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|||
|**Arctic Amplification**|It refers to the phenomenon where the **Arctic region experiences more rapid** **warming** compared to the rest of the planet|
|**Albedo Feedback Loop**|**Ice has high reflectivity (albedo)** compared to land or water surfaces. Decreased ice cover **reduces Earth’s surface reflectivity**, leading to more absorption of solar radiation and surface warming|
|**Darker Ocean Surface**|Bright ice is being replaced by **a darker open ocean surface** in the Arctic. **Less reflection of the sun’s radiation**, resulting in additional heating and ice loss|
|**Melting permafrost**|As permafrost thaws, **it releases stored greenhouse gases**, such as methane, which contribute to additional warming.|
|**Atmospheric circulation patterns**|Changes in atmospheric circulation patterns can transport warm air into the Arctic, further raising temperatures and melting ice.|

**Impact of Melting Arctic Ice:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
||**Description**|
|**Global Climate Change**|Rising sea levels, salinity levels, and current and precipitation patterns|
|**Danger to Coastal Communities**|Increased risk of coastal flooding, coastal erosion and storm surge for coastal communities|
|**Food Security**|**Polar vortexes, heat waves, and unpredictable weather patterns** due to ice loss can damage global crop production; **Shifting fish species distributions** and impacting the Arctic food web|
|**Biodiversity Threat**|– Melting Arctic ice threatens the biodiversity of the region, impacting species such as polar bears and altering the food web|
|**Emerging Race Course**|Competition among countries like the US, China, and Russia for resource extraction and influence in the Arctic region|
|**Tundra Degradation**|**Increasingly swampy tundra** due to global warming is damaging permafrost|
|**Threat to Biodiversity**|**Polar bears and other Arctic species** face challenges due to shrinking ice cover|

**What can India do?**

India should aim to understand the **dynamics of Arctic demography and governance**, going beyond scientific exploration. With its growing stature in world affairs, India can become the **voice of Arctic tribes and raise their issues in global forums**. By actively engaging in Arctic affairs, India can leverage this opportunity to shape policies and contribute to discussions concerning the region’s future. Previously **India unveiled India’s Arctic Policy document.**

**Conclusion:**

The focus should be on establishing a **global ocean treaty that addresses the governance of the oceans worldwide**, and prioritize safe and sustainable exploration of resources. This treaty should aim to ensure collaboration and cooperation among nations.
