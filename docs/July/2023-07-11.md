### [Palliative care in India](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/11/palliative-care-in-india/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Issues Relating to Development and Management of Social Sector/Services Relating to Health**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/palliative-care-non-communicable-disease-guidelines-np-ncd/article67060231.ece#:~:text=However%2C%20the%20revised%20NP%2DNCD,quality%20of%20life%20of%20patients.%E2%80%9D)

 **Context:** Access to palliative care in India continues to be abysmal.

**What is palliative care?**

- Palliative care is the **branch of medicine** focusing on **improving the quality of life and preventing suffering among those with life-limiting illnesses** like heart failure, kidney failure, certain neurological diseases, cancer, etc**.**
- Often misinterpreted as end-of-life care, **it focuses on the person as a whole**, not just the disease.

**Objectives of palliative care:**

- **To identify patients** at risk of over-medicalisation at the expense of quality of life and financial burden on the family.
- To address the **physical, psychological, spiritual, and social domains** of the health of people suffering from life-limiting diseases.
- It also includes **bereavement/grieving support** for the caregivers in case of the death of the patient.

**How many need palliative care in India?**

- **India has experienced a steep rise** in the burden of lifestyle-related non-communicable diseases.
- **Nearly 1.4 million people** are diagnosed with cancer in India every year while diabetes, hypertension, and respiratory diseases are also on the rise.
- **Estimated 7-10 million people** need palliative care sooner or later in the disease trajectory.

**Status of palliative care in India:**

- _Skewed availability of palliative care services_ → largely been available at tertiary healthcare facilities in urban areas → **only to 1-2%** of those who require it in the country.
- **55 million people in India** are pushed below the poverty line every year due to health-related expenditures (over-medicalisation plays a significant role).

**Steps taken:**

- **A three-tier health system**, multiple national health programmes and schemes (like the Ayushman Bharat Health Insurance Scheme).
- **National Programme for Palliative Care (NPPC):** It was announced in 2012, however, the lack of a dedicated budget has prevented the implementation of the programme since its inception.
- **National Programme for Health Care for the Elderly**: Launched in 2010, to provide accessible, affordable, and high-quality long-term, comprehensive and dedicated care services to an Ageing population.
- **Some best practices:** NGOs like Pallium India, Karunashraya, and CanSupport are trying to fill the gap in palliative care in India.
    - However, NGOs have limitations on how much they can spend and that doesn’t compare in any way with how much the government can spend.
- **National Programme for Prevention & Control of Non-Communicable Diseases (NP-NCD)**:
    - Launched in 2010 to counter the rising burden of noncommunicable diseases in the country.
    - The programme envisaged the provision of **promotive, preventive, and curative care** from primary to tertiary institutes.
    - **In order to strengthen palliative care**, the GoI revised the operational guidelines of NP-NCD.

**What are the gaps in the guidelines?**

- **Mention palliative care in synonymy with cancer only:** However, the need for palliative care was higher for non-cancer illnesses.
    - Cancer is just one of 20 common health conditions that require palliative care.
- **No mention of home-based palliative care services:** Since most patients who need palliative care are suffering from debilitating diseases, home-based care forms the ideal mode of healthcare delivery.
    - However, palliative care service delivery starts only from the district hospital in the revised guidelines.
- **No mention of paediatric palliative care:** The guidelines skipped an opportunity to bring focus on children suffering from chronic diseases.
- **Linking of 11 programmes (including NPPC) to promote convergence:** The mechanisms of the linkage with a programme (NPPC) that has not yet been fully implemented are unclear.

**Way ahead:**

- **Broaden the sphere of palliative care** to include multiple diseases and services.
- **Palliative care needs to be integrated** into health systems at all levels.
- **Include palliative care along with curative treatment.**
- Increased focus should be given to the impact assessment of palliative care programmes.

**Conclusion:** It is high time for India to realise the ongoing pandemic of non-communicable diseases and strengthen its palliative care services.

### [Carbon circular economy: Promise and challenges](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/11/carbon-circular-economy-promise-and-challenges/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Conservation, Environmental Pollution and Degradation**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/carbon-circular-economy-challenges-explained/article67060440.ece#:~:text=The%20circular%20economy's%20promise%20is,without%20compromising%20on%20economic%20growth.&text=Carbon%20dioxide%20emissions%20and%20the,at%20least%20a%20partial%20one.)

 **Context:** While CO2 emissions are the problem, a circular economy could be the solution, at least a partial one.

**Why are CO2 emissions the problem?**

- As we continue to burn fossil fuels and destroy natural habitats, **CO2 continues to accumulate in the atmosphere**.
- Heat reflected by the earth doesn’t all escape to space, **some of it is trapped by atmospheric CO2** and other GHGs.
- This leads to warmer land and oceans, accelerating ice melt, sea-level rise, and **extreme weather events and triggers food shortages, disease, loss of lives and property**, forced migrations, etc.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**A linear model of economy**|**The alternative – the circular model**|
|The required natural resources from the ground are taken to make products out of them, used and then thrown away at the end of their lives.|Take, make, use, recycle, reuse. Here, the product life is extended and the waste created is used as a resource to recreate similar or other products.|
|This model is **not sustainable**|**Sustainable.** This way, **dependence on natural resources can go down** without compromising comforts or economic growth.|

**The circular economy for carbon dioxide (CO2):**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/carbon_economy.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/carbon_economy.png)

**Meaning:**

- A circular carbon economy is a framework for managing and reducing emissions.
- It is a closed-loop system involving **4Rs**: reduce, reuse, recycle, and remove.

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/reduce.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/reduce.png)**

**Need for the circular economy for CO2:**

- To stop emitting ‘new’ CO2 as well as remove some of the CO2 piled up in the atmosphere.
    - **For the latter, carbon capture and utilisation techniques are useful.**
    - These are **technologies** developed to suck CO2 out of the atmosphere, which can be used to make items such as carbonated drinks, dry ice, and fire retardants, and **to synthesise clean high-efficiency fuel**.
- **The energy transition to renewables is a slow process.** The shift to electric vehicles, and decarbonisation (of steel, cement, and plastics manufacturing) will take time.

**Challenges towards creating a circular economy for carbon:**

- **Approaches and methods are not well developed:** Some of these are already commercial but only at a small scale, while others are still being prototyped and tested.
- **The energy required to capture and repurpose the CO2**: More energy is required to capture CO2 and convert it into a litre of fuel than the energy that this new litre of fuel will produce.
- **The energy we use to capture and repurpose CO2 should be clean energy.**

**Way ahead:**

- Net-zero CO2 additions can be achieved by using the stock of atmospheric CO2 over and over again.
- The rest of captured CO2 can be stored in the ground and lie there for a long period of time.

**Conclusion:**

Reducing real and perceived hurdles to Carbon, Capture, Use and Storage (CCUS) by formulating comprehensive strategies is essential for a swift, secure, and sustainable recovery that meets affordable energy access and climate goals.

### [The problem with battery electric vehicles](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/11/the-problem-with-battery-electric-vehicles/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Environment/ Science and Technology – Developments and their Applications and Effects in Everyday Life**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/the-problem-with-battery-electric-vehicles-8822335/)

 **Context:** The government of India is solely promoting battery electric vehicles (BEVs), regardless of the problems associated with them.

**Types of EVs:**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Types**|**Description**|**Examples**|
|**Hybrid EVs (HEVs)**|These are the vehicles which combine a conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) system with an electric propulsion system → hybrid drivetrain that substantially lowers fuel usage.|Toyota Hyryder in India|
|**Plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs)**|A hybrid drivetrain uses both an ICE and electric power for motive power, backed by rechargeable batteries that can be plugged into a power source.|Chevrolet Volt|
|**BEVs**|They run on a fully electric drivetrain powered by rechargeable batteries. They have no ICE or fuel tank.|Tata Nexon in India|
|**Fuel cell vehicles (FCVs)**|They combine hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity, which runs the motor, and the only residue of the chemical process is water.|Honda’s Clarity|

**Initiatives for Promoting EVs in India:**

- National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMPP)
- The Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric and Hybrid Vehicles in India (FAME India) scheme
- Production-linked incentive (PLI) Scheme – National Programme on Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Battery Storage
- Go Electric Campaign

**Why are these initiatives launched?**

To cut emissions and reduce costly fuel imports.

**Impact of these initiatives:**

- **EV sales have increased by more than 2,218% in the last 3 years.**
    - **Overall sales of EVs in India crossed the 1 million** milestone (over 60% of these are two-wheelers) for the first time in 2022-23. However, the total EV sales are **~5%**
    - **The government target** for EV sales is 30% for private cars, 70% for commercial vehicles and 80% for two and three-wheelers by 2030.
- **Other alternatives are ignored:** Currently, the Indian government offers clear tax advantages/incentives primarily for one type of vehicle – BEVs – with almost all other vehicle technologies grouped together under the heavy tax bracket.

**Issues with BEVs:**

- **State subsidies cornered by few:** The problem is that much of the subsidy or tax breaks end up in the hands of the **middle or upper middle classes**, who are typically the buyers of battery electric four-wheelers.
- **Poor charging network:** Only about 2,000 public charging stations are currently operational across the country.
- **Different charging demands:** For example, e-2W and 3W models in India are suited to slow charging, unlike cars and buses.
- **Non-renewable electricity source:** In India, the grid is still fed largely by coal-fired thermal plants.
- **Import dependence:** India is almost entirely dependent on imports from a small pool of countries (Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, Australia and China) to cater to its demand for Li for the production of Li-ion batteries.

**Way ahead:**

- **Investing in charging infrastructure** is 4-7 times more effective in EV adoption than providing upfront purchase subsidies (WB).
- **Adopting a battery-swapping mechanism** as an alternative for cases where fast charging is required.
- **Exploring other alternatives:**
    - **Hybrids**,
    - **Flexible/flex fuel vehicle** has an ICE, but unlike a regular petrol or diesel vehicle, it can run on more than one type of fuel or even a mixture of fuels such as petrol and ethanol.
    - **Hydrogen FCVs** are practically zero emission.
    - German manufacturer Porsche is developing a **synthetic fuel** that can make an ICE as clean as an EV.

### [Chandrayaan-3](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/11/chandrayaan-3-3/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus: Science and Technology: Space**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/chandrayaan-3-moon-south-pole-significance-8823703/)

 **Context:** Chandrayaan-3 is India’s upcoming lunar mission, which aims to be the world’s first mission to soft-land near the lunar south pole.

**What is Chandrayaan-3 Mission?**

Chandrayaan-3 is **India’s third moon mission** and is a follow-up of Chandrayaan-2 (2019) which aimed to land a rover on the **lunar South Pole**. The Mission will have three major modules- the

- **Propulsion** **module** ( will carry the lander and rover configuration till 100 km lunar orbit)
- **Lander module** (capability to soft land and deploy Rover)
- **Rover** (will carry out in-situ chemical analysis of the lunar surface)

**Challenges of landing on the South Pole:**

Previous spacecraft have mostly landed near the equatorial region of the Moon, a few degrees latitude north or south of the lunar equator. Landing near the equator is **easier and safer due to the hospitable terrain**, smooth surface, absence of steep slopes, and ample sunlight for solar-powered instruments.

The lunar south pole, on the other hand, presents a challenging terrain with extreme temperatures and areas that are in permanent shadow, **receiving no sunlight**.

**Why ISRO wants to explore the Moon’s south pole?**

- **Water Resources:** The south pole region is believed to have **water molecules in substantial amounts**, possibly trapped as ice in the permanently shadowed craters.
    - Exploring and confirming the presence of water is essential for future human missions and the potential utilization of lunar resources.
- **Scientific Discoveries:** The extreme environment and the presence of permanently shadowed regions provide a **preserved record of the Moon’s history and the early Solar System**.
- **Clues to Earth’s History:** The Moon is thought to have formed from debris generated by a giant impact between **a Mars-sized object** and the early Earth.
    - By studying the lunar south pole, scientists can gain insights into the materials and conditions that existed during the formation of the Earth-Moon system.
- **Global Collaborations**: ISRO-NASA successfully confirmed the presence of water from the data taken by Chandrayaan-1. Indo-Japan collaboration, **LUPEX** aims to send a lander and rover to the Moon’s south pole around 2024.
- **Technological Advancements**: By undertaking missions to this region, ISRO can develop and demonstrate innovative technologies **for soft landing, navigation, resource utilization, and long-duration operations** that can be applied in future space missions.

The Indian government is launching a **unique initiative to establish women-only courts (**known as Nari Adalats**)** at the village level as an **alternative dispute resolution forum** for issues such as domestic violence and property rights.

- The pilot project will start in **50 villages each in Assam and Jammu and Kashmir** in August and will later be expanded to the rest of the country.

**Composition**: The Nari Adalat of each village **would have 7-9 members** – half of which (Nyaya Sakhis [legal friends]) would be the elected members of the **gram panchayat and the other half women** with social standing like teachers, doctors and social workers – who would be nominated by the villagers.

- The **head of Nari Adalat called the Mukhya Nyaya Sakhi**[chief legal friend] will be chosen among the Nyay Sakhis.

**Tenure of Head:** The tenure of the head will be **generally six months after which a new one will be selected**.

**Aim**: The courts aim to address individual cases, raise awareness about social schemes, and provide accessible and affordable justice through alternate dispute resolution, counselling, and grievance redressal.

**Part of Mission Shakti**: The initiative is part of the Sambal **sub-scheme of Mission Shakti** (Ministry of Women and Child Development), which focuses on strengthening women’s safety, security, and empowerment.

- The scheme draws inspiration from the **Parivarik Mahila Lok Adalats**, which were run by the National Commission for Women until 2014-15 and addressed family and matrimonial disputes.

**Implementation**: Collaboration between the Ministry of Women and Child Development, Ministry of Panchayati Raj, Ministry of Rural Development and Common Service Centers operated by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology.

### [Performance Grading Index for Districts (PGI-D) 2.0](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/11/performance-grading-index-for-districts-pgi-d-2-0/)

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**PIB**](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1938299)

**Context:** The **Department of School Education and Literacy (DoSE&L)**, under the Ministry of Education, has released the **Performance Grading Index for Districts (PGI-D**) combined report for **2020-21 and 2021-22.**

- This index assesses the **performance of the school education system at the district level** by **creating a comprehensive analysis.**
- PGI is aligned with new initiatives of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, to monitor indicators relating to Goal 4 of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

**Findings:**

- None of the districts secured the top two grades — **Daksh and Utkarsh**. Most districts were in the **bottom three grades (less than 10% to 30%).**
- It is grouped **under 6 categories**, Outcomes, Effective Classroom Transaction, Infrastructure Facilities & Student’s Entitlements, School Safety & Child Protection, Digital Learning and Governance Process.

### [Export control](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/11/export-control/)

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/explained-why-is-china-limiting-exports-of-raw-materials/article67058415.ece)

 **Context:** China has implemented export restrictions on **gallium and germanium**, two elements crucial for chip production, solar panels, and fibre optics.

**What is Export control?**

Export control refers to the **regulations and restrictions imposed by governments** on the export of **certain goods, technologies, and services**. It is designed to protect national security, prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and ensure compliance with international agreements.

**Why this move?**

This move is seen as a **retaliation to the export restrictions** imposed by the **US and Western allies on cutting-edge technologies**.

**Impact:**

- **Negative:** **Countries may face chip shortage**: China’s control over the supply chain and the licensing system of these minerals could give them more leverage in trade negotiations, and create constraints for other countries.
    - This development further escalates the ongoing technology war between nations (particularly between US and China)
- **Positive:** With China’s restrictions, other countries can ramp up their production to substitute for China’s supply. However, It remains to be seen how other countries will respond and diversify their supply chains for these critical materials.

**About Gallium** 

Gallium is a **soft, silvery metal** that is often found in small amounts in various minerals. Gallium has a low melting point, making it useful for applications such as thermometers and as a component in alloys. It is also used in the manufacture of **semiconductors, LEDs, and various electronic devices**.

**About Germanium:**

Germanium is a **lustrous, hard, greyish-white metalloid** that is commonly found in trace amounts in certain minerals. Germanium has semiconductor properties, making it useful in electronic devices such as transistors and diodes. It is also used in infrared optics, fibre optics, and solar cells. Germanium has a high refractive index and excellent thermal conductivity, which makes it valuable in optical and thermal applications.
