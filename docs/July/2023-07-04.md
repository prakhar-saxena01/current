### [How Indian assimilation and secularism is better than French?](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/04/how-indian-assimilation-and-secularism-is-better-than-french/)

#### **GS Paper 1**

 **Syllabus:** **Effects of Globalization on Indian Society/ Social Empowerment, Communalism, Regionalism & Secularism**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/behind-frances-street-violence-history-colonialism-flawed-assimilation-8699314/)

 **Context:** After the police killed a teenager (Nahel) of Algerian descent in Nanterre (France), violent protests spread across France.

**France’s ethnic composition:**

- France is one of the **most racially and ethnically diverse** countries in Europe.
- At least 32% of France’s population under 60 has at least one immigrant ancestor → trace their origins to countries **outside Europe, especially Africa.**

**The French African colonies:**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/french_africa.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/french_africa.png)

- The formal French presence in Africa began with the capture of Madagascar in **1642** and the establishment of a port at Saint-Louis (present-day Senegal) in **1659**.
- This was primarily fuelled by France’s desire **to secure access to commodities such as gum Arabic and groundnuts**, and the **trans-Atlantic slave trade**.
- **A second phase of French colonisation** began with the **invasion of Algiers in 1830**.
- **By the early years of the 20th century**, France held present-day Algeria, Morocco, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Benin, Guinea, Ivory Coast and Niger.
- However, almost all of France’s African colonies achieved independence by **1962**.

**The root cause behind the killing:**

- **Systemic racism in French policing**: Young men who are Black/ of North African descent, are 20 times more likely to be subjected to police identity checks than the rest of the population.
- **The Continuing France’s Sphere of Influence and Migration:**
    - Critics say **France’s exploitative relationship** (Neocolonialism/ Last Stage of Imperialism) **with its former colonies still continues**.
    - **This includes** repeatedly intervening in political affairs, having a considerable military presence and several economically extractive processes.
    - **An outcome of this situation** – Africa’s continued impoverishment and the allure of European riches and quality of life – **has been extensive migration from Africa to Europe**.
    - For former French countries, France has been the preferred destination, where minimum wages and workers’ rights are assured.
- **The failure of assimilation:**
    - After World War II, France suffered from massive labour shortages and actively l**ured cheap labour from its colonies.**
    - Over the decades, this led to a **thriving African population in France,** many of whom are today naturalised citizens.
    - However, France’s uniqueness lies in the **“physical presence and conceptual absence of cultural difference”** – as it does not see itself as a **pluralist or multicultural society**.
    - The French state has focussed on **“assimilating” its diverse population into the “French ideal”** by strictly adhering to political egalitarianism.
    - Yet, this attempt at assimilation has remained incomplete, leading to deep tensions in French society.

- **Discrimination:** African immigrants are among the poorest in the country → lowest levels of education, the highest levels of unemployment → highest rates of crime → bear the brunt of police violence, accentuated by ingrained racial attitudes.

**Lessons to be learnt from India:**

- **Secularism:**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/secu.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/secu.png)

- **Unity in diversity:**
    - It relates to the state of togetherness or integrity despite the presence of infinite diversity.
    - In India, it can be seen through national integration, growth and development, global recognition and peaceful coexistence.

**Conclusion:** In the era of globalisation and increased migration, governments should prefer a **‘salad bowl’** (an intercultural society can integrate different cultures while maintaining their separate identities) rather than **a ‘melting pot’** (monoculture) metaphor**.**

### [Comparison of Affirmative Action in India and the USA](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/04/comparison-of-affirmative-action-in-india-and-the-usa/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: Comparision of the Constitution of India with other countries**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/us-supreme-court-limits-affirmative-action-colleges-significance-8695597/)

 **Context**: The Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) recently **ruled on affirmative action in college admissions, limiting its use**. We already covered a summary of the News **(**[**Affirmative Action in Higher Education**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/30/affirmative-action-in-higher-education/)**).** Here we will compare the affirmative actions of India and the USA.

**Meaning of Affirmative Action:**

Affirmative action refers to **policies and practices aimed** at promoting **equal opportunities for historically disadvantaged groups**, particularly in areas such as **education, employment, and government contracts**.

It involves taking proactive steps to **address past discrimination and promote diversity** and **inclusion**. Affirmative action can involve measures such as **preferential treatment, quotas, or targeted outreach programs** to ensure representation and equal access to opportunities for underrepresented groups.

**Comparison of affirmative action in India and the United States:**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Dimension**|**Affirmative Action in India**|**Affirmative Action in the USA**|
|**Purpose**|Address historical **social and economic inequalities** based on caste|Address historical **discrimination based on Race**|
|**Targeted Groups**|Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), Other Backward Classes (OBC)|**African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, Asian Americans**|
|**Reservation System**|**Reservation Quota policies** provide reserved seats in education, employment, and politics|**Quota systems are not used**. Instead, diversity and inclusive policies are encouraged in the **admission practices that seek to increase** the representation of **Black, Hispanic and other minority students** in colleges and universities.|
|**Origin**|**William Hunter and Jyotirao Phule in 1882** originally conceived the idea of a caste-based reservation system. Fundamental right under **Articles 15(4) and 16(4) of the Independent India constitution.**|**Civil Rights Act of 1964** which ban discrimination on various grounds.|
|**Reservation Percentage**|**Fixed at 50%** (Indra Sawhney judgement) for OBC, SC & ST in both employment and education|**No fixed percentage**. It depends on the institution or program and varies for different states of the USA|
|**Criteria for Eligibility**|**Caste-based identity; S**ocial, Education and economic (EWS quota) backwardness|Race, ethnicity, and historical disadvantage|
|**Duration**|Originally **intended as a temporary measure in the Indian constitution**, but extended to achieve social justice|Continues to evolve based on societal changes and legal interpretations|
|**Controversies**|The debate over extending reservations to other communities and concerns about **reverse discrimination**<br><br>**e.g.,** 2006 Anti-Reservation Protests; Patel and Jats demanding reservation|Controversies around misuse of affirmative policies.|

**The Argument for Affirmative Action:**

**Affirmative Action** is a necessary policy to **rectify the long-standing historical injustices** faced by marginalized communities. It provides them with **access to education, jobs, and public services, enabling social mobility and breaking** the cycle of poverty. By promoting **diversity and inclusion**, reservation contributes to a more equitable and harmonious society.

**Argument Against Affirmative Actions:** 

While the intention of **Affirmative Action** is laudable, it has some unintended consequences. Reservation can lead to **divisions and animosity among different groups**, and it may perpetuate the **notion of caste in society**. It also hampers **meritocracy**, as deserving candidates may be overlooked in favour of less qualified candidates from reserved categories. Instead, a **more targeted and comprehensive approach** addressing economic backwardness could be considered.

**Way Forward:**

To strike a balance, **Affirmative policies** should be reevaluated to target the **most marginalized and economically disadvantaged** individuals rather than perpetuating caste-based reservations. A strong focus on **quality education and skill development** for all, regardless of caste or creed, will empower the marginalized and ensure equal opportunities.

**Conclusion:**

Public awareness and dialogue on the purpose and implementation of reservation are essential to foster understanding and cooperation among diverse sections of society.

### [Impact of CSR funds](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/04/impact-of-csr-funds/)

#### **GS Paper 2/4**

 **Syllabus:** **Development process and the development industry/ Corporate governance**

**Source:** [**ET**](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/impact-of-csr-funds-not-widely-felt-despite-jump-in-spending-mca/printarticle/101432747.cms)

 **Context:** The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) has flagged the limited impact of corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives despite a spike in such spending in recent years.

**What is CSR?**

- It is a **commitment** by businesses to integrate social and environmental concerns into their business operations.
- India became the first country in the world to make corporate social responsibility (CSR) mandatory, following an amendment to **the Companies Act, 2013 in April 2014**.
- Businesses can invest **at least 2%** of their net profit (over the preceding 3 years) **in areas** such as education, poverty, gender equality, and hunger as part of any CSR compliance.

**Significance:** Every company has a **moral responsibility** to play an active role in discharging social obligations, subject to the financial health of the company.

**CSR trends in India:**

- Since the applicability of the mandatory CSR provision in 2014, **CSR spending by corporate India has increased significantly**.
- **For example,** CSR spending stood at Rs 26,210 crore in FY21, having grown 80% from FY16.
- **The education sector received the maximum funding** (38%) followed by hunger, poverty, and healthcare (25%), environmental sustainability (12%), and rural development (11%).

 **Examples of CSR in India:**

- **Tata Group:** It has engaged in women empowerment activities, income generation, rural community development, and other social welfare programs.
- **Ultratech Cement:** The company has organised medical camps, immunisation programs, sanitization programs, water conservation programs, organic farming programs, etc.
- **Mahindra & Mahindra:** It runs programs such as **Nanhi Kali** focusing on education for girls, Mahindra Pride Schools for industrial training, and Lifeline Express for healthcare services in remote areas.

**Concerns:**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fund.jpg?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fund.jpg)

- **The impact of the CSR funds is not widely felt**.
- Programs such as technology incubators, sports, and armed forces, reducing inequalities saw **negligible spending.**
- **Regional disparities** as the Companies Act require companies should give preference to the areas around which they operate while allocating CSR funds.

**Way ahead:**

- Companies need to adopt **a long-term approach** “to yield productive results”. This will –
    - **Enhance the visibility** as well as the impact of invested funds
    - **Strike the right balance** of capital investments and operational expenses
    - Ensure the initiatives undertaken become **self-sustaining** – running seamlessly without being a burden on the companies themselves.
- **The highest quality risk management framework** needs to be adopted, so as to make the CSR projects sustainable
- It is imperative to **strike a balance between local area preferences with national priorities** to avoid any concentration of CSR funds in specific regions.

**Conclusion:** The emphasis should be on creating an appropriate structure for CSR, ensuring that the funds go towards the well-being of the community.

### [6 years of GST](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/04/6-years-of-gst/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Indian Economy and issues relating to Planning, Mobilization of Resources**

**Source:** [**HT**](https://www.hindustantimes.com/business/6-years-of-gst-tracing-role-of-manmohan-singh-atal-bihari-vajpayee-arun-jaitley-and-others-101688198857589.html)

 **Context:** With the implementation of a Goods and Services Tax (GST) on July 1 2017, India took a huge step towards modifying its indirect taxation system.

**About Goods and Services Tax (GST):** 

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/gst_ind.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/gst_ind.png)

- It is an **indirect tax** (not directly paid by customers to the government) that came into effect on July 1, 2017, as a result of the **101st Amendment to the Indian Constitution**.
- It is imposed on both manufacturers and sellers of goods, as well as suppliers of services.
- For tax collection, it is divided into five tax slabs – **0%, 5%, 12%, 18%, and 28%.**

**About GST Council:**

- It is **an apex committee** to modify, reconciles or make recommendations to the Union and the States on GST, like the goods and services that may be subjected or exempted from GST, model GST laws, etc.
- **Article 279A** of the Indian Constitution empowers the President of India to constitute a joint forum of the Centre and States called the GST Council.

**Need for GST:**

- **The inclusion of several indirect taxes** at various levels of the supply chain **hampered the Indian tax system**.
- **This resulted in a complicated and fragmented tax framework** that included excise duty, service tax, VAT, central sales tax (CST), and other taxes.
- These led to tax **cascading (tax on tax)**, raising the entire tax burden on goods and services.
- Hence, the primary goal of GST is –
    - **To simplify the tax system by substituting a single indirect tax for several indirect levies**
    - Eliminating tax cascading by establishing a uniform tax structure

**Achievements of GST:**

- **Revenue collection:**
    - The average growth rate of Gross GST revenue from 2018-19 to 2022-23 stands at **3%**, surpassing the nominal GDP growth rate of 9.8%.
    - **The (June 2023) collection has crossed the 1.6 lakh crore mark** for the 4th time since the inception of GST.
    - This is noteworthy as indirect taxes **typically exhibit lower buoyancy** – an increase in its revenue rate without increasing the tax rate.
- **A seamless market and digitised compliance:**
    - GST laid the foundation for a seamless national market, r**eshaping India’s tax landscape and driving economic growth**.
    - By digitising processes from registration to return filing, the GST portal ensured **smoother compliance for businesses, fostering a tech-enabled environment**.
    - It paved the way for **other significant indirect tax reforms, including e-way bills and e-invoicing**, promoting transparent data sharing between businesses and the government.
- **Empowering the manufacturing sector:** GST’s impact on the manufacturing sector was remarkable, as it eliminated the cascading effect of taxes and reduced manufacturing costs.

**Challenges still persisting:**

- **Complexities** in return forms and the **ambiguity** surrounding tax rates and **classifications** of certain goods and services lead to **disputes and uncertainty**.
- **Combating tax fraud remained a priority**, with measures in place to ensure compliance and weed out fraudulent businesses.

**Some areas that deserve attention are:**

- **Commence taxation** of petroleum crude, high-speed diesel, petrol, natural gas and aviation turbine fuel and similarly, alcohol meant for human consumption;
- **Inclusion of other levies** such as electricity duty, stamp duty, etc;
- **Clarifying** taxation of online gaming activities, transactions involving cryptocurrency, etc.
- **The officials should also look into** rationalisation of the tax rates (slabs); upgrading the law to deal with a digital world and keep up with the various technological developments.

**Conclusion:**

- The implementation of GST has definitely been a success **but is still a new reform with the potential to witness phenomenal growth and harmonisation** in the coming years.
- **GST has shown immense promise**, reshaping the economy and driving digitization while also confronting challenges and fraud.
