### [The Collegium system](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/17/the-collegium-system/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Structure, Organization and Functioning of the Judiciary**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-collegiums-quiet-transparency-is-driving-a-change/article67087258.ece#:~:text=Since%20early%20this%20year%2C%20the,court%20and%20the%20High%20Courts.)

 **Context:** The SC Collegium under CJI DY Chandrachud has quietly and transparently streamlined the appointment process of judges to the constitutional courts.

**The Collegium system:**

- **About:**
    - **The collegium system,** which has evolved through judgments of the SC, is the way by which judges of the SC and HCs are **appointed and transferred**.
    - **It is a five-member body**, headed by the incumbent CJI and comprises the four other senior most judges of the SC at that time.
- **Evolution – Three Judges Cases:**
    - P. Gupta & Others v. Union of India (1981), Advocate on Record Association v. UoI (1993) and re Presidential Reference case (1998).
    - It was established that the recommendation made by the CJI **without following the consultation process** for the appointment of SC and HC Judges is **not binding** on the government.
- **Criticism:**
    - **The system is non-transparent** since it is seen as a closed-door affair with no prescribed norms regarding eligibility criteria, or selection procedure.
    - **The system is opaque and not accountable**. Judges do not appoint judges all over the world, but in India, they do.
    - **Limited role of the government,** may object to and seek clarification on the collegium’s choices, but if the collegium reiterates the same names, the government is bound to appoint them.
- **Efforts to reform the collegium system:** NJAC, Memorandum of Procedure (MoP), etc.

**How has the appointment process been streamlined recently?**

- **Adding a balanced mix of merit and seniority** through a selection procedure which involves meaningful discussion on and assessment of candidates’ judicial acumen.
- **Recommendations of the Collegium are now notified within days by the government.**
- **The requirements for candidates**’ **consideration** have been made public by the Collegium’s resolutions.

**Points under the Collegium’s consideration:**

- **Quality of judgments of the candidates:** A Judgment Evaluation Committee goes through the judicial work of the candidates.
    - **Justice Dipankar Dutta’s** name was the first to be cleared for SC appointment by the Collegium in this manner.
- **The seniority of Chief Justices and senior puisne Judges** in their respective parent HCs as well as overall seniority of the HC Judges.
- **The merit, performance and integrity** of the judges are under consideration.
- **The need to ensure diversity and inclusion** in the SC. Diversity and inclusion means –
    - Representation of HC not/inadequately represented;
    - Appointment of persons from marginalised and backward segments of society;
    - Gender diversity (Justice Sunita Agarwal appointed as the CJ of the Gujarat HC); and
    - Representation of minorities.
- **The need to ensure the better administration of justice:** As a result, the Collegium did not bow to the request made by three HC judges against their out-of-State transfers.

### [Issue of succession faced by the regional political parties in India](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/17/issue-of-succession-faced-by-the-regional-political-parties-in-india/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus:** **Pressure Groups & Formal/informal Associations & Their Role in Polity**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/are-regional-parties-in-india-facing-a-succession-problem/article67076019.ece)

 **Context:** 24 years after its formation, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) split over the question of succession.

**Similar cases:**

- **The Shiv Sena,** **Samajwadi Party (SP)** have gone through this churn.
- **The Biju Janata Dal (BJD)** seems poised to undergo this churn.

**The rise of regional parties in India:**

- It coincided with the decline of Congress in the **1990s**.
- They were basically **caste-based alignments**, with the Mandal movement providing the necessary prompt.

**Characteristics of regional parties in India:**

- **Have a regional agenda** (concentrates on regional or local matters) and recognise a distinct religious, ethnic, cultural or linguistic group.
- **The electoral ground** is restricted to a specific state or region.

**Reasons for succession battles in several regional parties in India today:**

- **Have become ‘Hindu undivided families’:** Consisting of all those who have directly descended from a common ancestor as well as their wives and unmarried daughters.
- **Have given up their larger purpose:**
    - Many of these parties began with the goals of promoting sub-nationalism, protecting their own caste or ethnicity and larger federal interests (DMK).
    - But over a period of time, **they have all become parties strangled in family feuds**.
- **Have a centralised party structure**, _low intra-party_ **democracy**, and are often **controlled by a single family.**
- **Have not evolved with time:** There is splintering within castes and caste identity itself has gone through a lot of change.
    - **The ideological divide is thinning,** forcing everybody to go beyond family, caste, or ethnic loyalty to create a larger purpose.

**Implications of these succession battles:** With the decline of regional parties, **the challenges to a dominant party system will reduce**.

 **Challenges for regional parties:**

- **The paradox** about regional parties is that the family is central to their survival, but the family is also a liability.
- **Absence of charismatic leaders:** For example, for the BJD, who will be the leader after Naveen Patnaik is a worrying question.

**Way ahead:**

- The regional parties have to come up with an **internal decision-making process** for anointing the next leader.
- These regional parties can have a **think tank** (like RSS for BJP) that sits as the arbitrator to look for an alternative when required.

### [Efforts to reform the statistical system in India](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/17/efforts-to-reform-the-statistical-system-in-india/)

####  **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Government Policies and Interventions for Development in various sectors**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/government-forms-new-panel-to-review-all-official-data/article67087739.ece#:~:text=The%20government%20has%20constituted%20a,citing%20'data%20quality%20issues'.)

 **Context:** The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) has constituted a Standing Committee on Statistics (SCoS) to **reform the statistical system in India.**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**India’s statistical machinery**|   |
|**MoSPI**|It came into existence as an Independent Ministry in **1999** after the merger of the Department of Statistics and the Department of Programme Implementation.|
|It has two wings **– Statistics and Programme Implementation**.|
|**The Statistics Wing**|Called the National Statistical Office (**NSO**), it consists of the Central Statistical Office (**CSO**), the Computer Center and the National Sample Survey Office (**NSSO**).|
|Besides these two wings, there is the National Statistical Commission (NSC) and one autonomous Institute of National importance – the Indian Statistical Institute.|
|**Mandate of NSO**|NSO is the **nodal agency** for the planned development of the statistical system in the country.|
|It coordinates the statistical work in respect of the **Ministries or Departments** of the Government of India and maintains liaison with **international statistical organisations** (UNSD, ESCAP, etc).|
|It prepares **national accounts** as well as publishes annual estimates of national products and provides **statistical information** to assess and evaluate the changes in the growth, composition and structure of the organised manufacturing sector.|
|It compiles and releases the Index of Industrial Production **(IIP)**, Conducts the Annual Survey of Industries **(ASI), all-India Economic Censuses** and follow-up enterprise survey.|
|**Criticism**|**Bibek Debroy** – the chairperson of the Economic Advisory Council (EAC) to the PM, had suggested an overhaul of the system and contended that the Indian Statistical Service has “**little expertise in survey design**”.|

**About the SCoS:**

- **It will replace:** The Standing Committee on Economic Statistics (SCES), which was constituted in 2019 to examine economic indicators only.
- **Chairman:** India’s first chief statistician and the former chairman of the NSC – **Pronab Sen**, has been named the chair of the new committee.
- **Mandate:**
    - To provide a new internal oversight mechanism for official data, and
    - To review the framework and results of all surveys conducted under the aegis of the NSO.
    - While the panel will help finalise survey results, the NSC will have the ultimate authority to approve the publication of those results.
- **Terms of reference:**
    - **To ensure more coverage**, the panel –
        - Has 10 official members and 4 non-official members who are eminent academics.
        - Will look beyond economic data and advise the Ministry on technical aspects (sampling, design, methodology) for all surveys.
    - **To identify data gaps** to be filled by official statistics, along with an appropriate strategy to plug those gaps.
    - **To explore the use of administrative statistics** to improve data outcomes.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Concerns Related to the Indian Statistical System**|   |
|**Institutional and Structural Issues**|**Not released timely:** The government have a timetable for the release of national accounts, the Index of Industrial Production and inflation. But there are **no specific timelines for the release of labour force statistics** and consumption expenditure surveys|
||**Apprehensions regarding NSSO:** Under MoSPI, it has become part of the general bureaucracy and ceases to exist as an autonomous body. Moreover, the fear is that in the absence of the oversight of independent bodies like the CSI and NSC, the statistical system may become amenable to political interference.|
|**Methodology**|Use of small surveys for estimations|
|Challenges in price adjustment for GDP calculations|
|The faulty approach in data collection and collation|
|The incoherence of GDP data|
|**Nature of Data**|Unreliable data on the unorganised sector|
|Shortcomings in MCA21 data used for GDP calculations|

### [Breaking Barriers and Building Inclusivity – Women still minority](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/17/breaking-barriers-and-building-inclusivity-women-still-minority/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus****: Social Justice**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://epaper.thehindu.com/ccidist-ws/th/th_delhi/issues/43908/OPS/G2EBG9K9E.1+G3KBGAFJC.1.html)

**Context:** Preeti Aghalyam, **the first woman to become the Director of an Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)**, highlighted the **underrepresentation of women on IIT campuses**.

- Her appointment coincides with a broader effort by various **IITs to address the gender imbalance on their campuses**.

The enrolment ratio of **men to women in engineering colleges in India** has improved over the years. However, the proportion of women in IITs remains low, **with some institutes having as little as 5% to 12% female representation in 2014.**

**Implications of Underrepresentation of Women in Higher Education in India:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Implications**|**Examples**|
|**Limited Access to Opportunities**|Women miss out on **educational and career opportunities**, limiting their potential for growth and advancement.|
|**Gender-Based Stereotyping and Bias**|Stereotypes reinforce **gender roles**, limiting women’s choices in pursuing certain fields of study or careers.|
|**Unequal Workforce Representation**|Fewer women in higher education result in a limited pool of qualified female professionals in various sectors, **leading to gender imbalance in the workforce.**|
|**Economic Disparities**|Women’s lower participation in higher education can contribute to the **gender pay gap and economic disparities** between men and women.|
|**Lack of Diverse Perspectives**|The absence of women’s voices and perspectives in academia limits the **development of inclusive knowledge** and hinders innovation.|
|**Reinforcement of Social Norms**|The underrepresentation of women in higher education perpetuates **traditional societal norms and expectations**, hindering progress towards gender equality.|
|**Missed Contributions to Research and Innovation**|Society misses out on the **unique talents, perspectives, and contributions that women** can bring to research and innovation in various fields.|

**Government Schemes for Women:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
||**Description**|
|**Digital Gender Atlas**|Ministry of Human Resource Development has prepared a digital gender atlas for advancing girls’ education in India.|
|**National Scheme of Incentive to Girls for Secondary Education (NSIGSE)**|The objective of the scheme is to establish an enabling environment to reduce dropouts and to promote the enrolment of girl children in secondary schools.|
|**Nai Manzil**|An integrated education and skilling scheme in partnership with the World Bank, aimed at **minority youth without a formal school leaving certificate**, providing formal education and skills for better employment and livelihoods. **30% target allocation for women beneficiaries.**|
|**Naya Savera**|A scheme providing financial support to students from minority communities to prepare for competitive examinations. **30% allocation for women beneficiaries**.|

**Conclusion:**

Efforts for gender parity continue as women remain a minority at IITs. While progress has been made, there is still a long way to go in improving the gender ratio at these institutions.

### [Lightening: Natural Disaster](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/17/lightening-natural-disaster/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus****: Disaster Management**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://epaper.thehindu.com/ccidist-ws/th/th_international/issues/43913/OPS/GJ2BG7PAO.1+GH7BGA0UI.1.html)

**Context**: The Indian Union government is **reluctant to declare lightning a natural** [**disaster**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/disaster-management/background-of-disaster-management/types-of-disaster/), as it believes that deaths **caused by lightning can be prevented through awareness of safety measures**.

- India **currently has an early warning system for lightning**, providing forecasts **from five days to up to three hours in advance.**

Some states like **Bihar and West Bengal have been urging the government to classify lightning deaths as natural disasters.** If declared, victims would be eligible for compensation from the **State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF), with the central government contributing 75% to the fund.**

**Status of death due to lightning:** According to **data from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB),** lightning strikes **caused 2,880 deaths in 2021, accounting for 40% of all accidental deaths** caused by natural forces.

**What is a Disaster?**

A disaster is a result of **natural or man-made causes that leads to sudden disruption of normal life**, causing severe **damage to life and property** to an extent that available **social and economic protection mechanisms are inadequate to cope.**

 In India, the criteria for declaring a disaster as a natural disaster are typically based on the guidelines provided by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).

**Criteria for Declaring a Natural Disaster in India:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
||**Description**|
|**Non-Anthropogenic**|The disaster should **not be primarily caused by human activities or interventions and** should result from natural phenomena beyond human control.|
|**Impact**|The disaster should cause **significant damage, loss of life, or disruption to the environment, infrastructure,** or socio-economic activities, requiring specialized response and recovery measures.|
|**Verification**|The occurrence and impact of the disaster should be **verified and confirmed by relevant government authorities,** scientific institutions, or disaster management agencies.|
|**Recognition**|The disaster should be recognized as a natural disaster by the **concerned state or central government authorities** responsible for disaster management.|

**About** [**Lightening**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/07/14/how-lightning-strikes-3/)**:**

- It is a **very rapid and massive discharge of electricity into the atmosphere.**It is the process of **occurrence of a natural ‘electrical discharge of very short duration and high voltage between a cloud and the ground or within a cloud’**, accompanied by a bright flash and sound, and sometimes thunderstorms.

|---|---|
|**Impacts of Lightning**|**Description**|
|**Human Casualties**|Between **1972 and 2019**, around 90,632 people were killed due to lightning strikes.<br><br>Lightning is the **biggest contributor to accidental deaths** due to natural causes.|
|**Agriculture Sector**|Frequent lightning strikes **adversely impact small and marginal farmers**. Around **77 per cent of farmers are killed due to lightning** as they work in agricultural fields during the Kharif cropping season in the monsoon period.|
|**Rural Areas**|Mainly, **rural and forest areas are the most vulnerable due to lightning because** of the presence of **water bodies and tall trees**, with almost **96 per cent of deaths occurring in rural areas compared to urban areas**. Regarding deaths due to lightning, the population in rural areas is more vulnerable than in urban areas.|
|**Tribal Population**|The **Annual Lightning Report 2020-2021 confirms that 60-70 per cent of deaths** occurred in tribal populations due to lightning in Jharkhand, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, and other states.|
|**Other Sectors**|Lightning also adversely impacts the **aviation, power, and communication sectors.**|

### [J Robert Oppenheimer](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/17/j-robert-oppenheimer/)

#### **GS Paper 4**

 **Syllabus: Ethics of War/nuclear weapon**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/j-robert-oppenheimer-atom-bomb-gita-8839175/#:~:text=In%201965%2C%20speaking%20on%20the,worlds'%2C%E2%80%9D%20Oppenheimer%20said.)

1. Robert Oppenheimer was the **scientific director of the Manhattan Project**, the USA’s World War II program to develop the first nuclear weapons. He is known as the **“Father of the Atomic Bomb”.**

However, after witnessing the destructive power of nuclear weapons, Oppenheimer became a **vocal advocate against their proliferation**. He found solace and philosophical guidance in the Bhagavad Gita, quoting the famous line **“I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.”**

Oppenheimer **actively opposed nuclear weapons** and worked to curtail their spread. Unfortunately, he faced **political persecution during the Cold War era** and lost his security clearance. Today, Oppenheimer’s story serves as a cautionary tale and highlights the ethical dilemmas faced by scientists involved in creating powerful weapons.

- **Moral Responsibility**: Scientists must consider the potential destruction and harm caused by their weapons.
- **Dual-Use Technology:** The technologies they create can be misused or have unintended consequences, raising ethical concerns.
- **Impact on Innocent Lives:** Scientists question the effects on civilians, as powerful weapons often cause collateral damage.
- **Contributing to Conflict**: Scientists grapple with the ethical dilemma of their work potentially exacerbating conflicts and violence.
- **Long-Term Consequences**: Scientists must weigh the lasting effects, including proliferation and the risk of an arms race.
- **Personal Accountability:** Scientists may face moral conflicts and be held accountable for the ethical implications of their inventions.

**There are three principles for conduct in war**:

- **Discrimination** (distinguishing between enemy combatants and non-combatants)
- **Proportionality** (the harms must be proportional to the gains)
- Actions must be **militarily necessary**

**Insta Mains:** 

**Can a war ever be justified on moral grounds? Support your answer with suitable arguments. (10M)**

### [“I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds”](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/17/i-am-become-death-the-destroyer-of-worlds/)

#### **Content for Mains Enrichment**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/j-robert-oppenheimer-atom-bomb-gita-8839175/)

**Context**: J Robert Oppenheimer used this quote to display regrets about his invention of nuclear weapons.

The quote **“Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds”** is not directly from the Bhagavad Gita but rather a paraphrase of a verse in the Gita.

**Translated into English, this verse means**:

**“The Supreme Lord said: Time I am, the great destroyer of the worlds, and I have come here to destroy all people.”**

The verse is part of a **conversation between Lord Krishna and Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra**. Krishna reveals his **universal form**, a divine manifestation displaying his supreme power and **cosmic nature**. Arjuna is **awe-struck and becomes aware of the immense destructive power that Krishna** wields as the **God** **of Time.** 

Oppenheimer, who was familiar with the Bhagavad Gita, invoked this quote to **express the profound impact and consequences of the atomic bomb**, which, like Krishna, brought immense destructive power and the potential to annihilate entire worlds.

Refer to the CME article on J Robert Oppenheimer for the ethical dimension of it.

### [Endogamy and harmful genetic variants in India](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/17/endogamy-and-harmful-genetic-variants-in-india/)

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/south-indian-population-homozygous-genotypes-genetic-disorders-study/article67070500.ece)

 **Context:** A study by researchers at the **Institute for Human Genetics**, University of California, focused on **genetic differences among South Asian populations, particularly in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.**

- The researchers found **distinct genetic patterns among different regions, including smaller geographies within India, attributed to endogamous practices like caste-based and region-based marriages**.

**About Endogamy:**

- Endogamy is the practice of **marrying within a specific social, cultural, or ethnic group, often with the aim of preserving traditions, customs, and identity within that group.**

**Key Findings:**

- The study also revealed a worrying trend of **higher frequency of homozygous genotypes in the South Asian cohort, which can increase the risk of genetic disorders**.
- The research highlighted the need for a **detailed map of the Indian genome to understand the country’s incredible diversity and address major hereditary disorders**.

Conducting such studies within the country would also **protect vulnerable communities from exploitation**. Harnessing the power of genetic studies **could lead to interventions for major health concerns in India.**

 **Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/synthetic-biology-minimal-genome-natural-adaptation/article67082934.ece)

 **Context:** Recent research demonstrates that synthetic life forms with minimal genomes can evolve and out-compete non-evolved versions.

**What is evolution?**

Evolution is the process of **gradual change and development in living organisms over time**. It involves the **passing on of traits from one generation to the next**, leading to the diversity and adaptation of species to their environment.

**What is Synthetic Genome?**

A synthetic genome is **an artificially created or modified genetic material** that can be inserted into a living organism. It involves **designing and constructing DNA sequences** in a laboratory setting, allowing scientists to engineer or manipulate the genetic makeup of an organism.

- For example, scientists have synthesized genomes for bacteria like **Mycoplasma** **mycoides**, creating synthetic life forms capable of replication.

**Significance of Evolution of Synthetic Genome:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Significance**|**Examples**|
|**Enhanced understanding of life processes**|Synthesis of **JCVI-syn1.0,** the first synthetic life form, helped unravel molecular mechanisms of life|

 **Context**: The conservation **status of the hoolock gibbon**, **India’s only ape species**, has become a matter of **concern at a global event on gibbons held in China.**

 **About Gibbons:**

 **It is the smallest and fastest ape** and is found in **tropical and subtropical forests** in Southeast Asia. The hoolock gibbon, **unique to India’s northeast, is one of the 20 gibbon species on Earth, with an estimated population of 12,000.**

- All 20 gibbon species, including the **hoolock gibbon**, are at a **high risk of extinction due to dramatic declines in their distribution and populations since 1900,** leaving only **small populations in tropical rainforests.**
- **Threats:** The primary threat to the hoolock gibbon in India is the **felling of trees for infrastructure projects.**
- **Initiatives**: The **Global Gibbon Network (GGN)** aims to **protect and conserve gibbons** and their habitats by **promoting participatory conservation policies and actions**.
    - **Aaranyak**, a non-profit conservation organization based in Assam, India, **is one of the founding organizations of the GGN from seven countries.**

**Controversy regarding conservation status:**

Initially believed to be two separate species, a genetic analysis by the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) in Hyderabad in 2021 revealed that there is **only one species of ape in India, the hoolock gibbon**.

However, the **International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List classifies the western hoolock gibbon as endangered and the eastern hoolock gibbon as vulnerable**, which adds complexity to their conservation status.
