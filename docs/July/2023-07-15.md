### [Impact of Moon on Earth](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/15/impact-of-moon-on-earth/)

#### **GS Paper 1**

 **Syllabus: Evolution of the Solar System and Earth**

**Context**: India successfully sent its Chandrayaan 3 mission to the moon.

**Formation of Earth and Moon:**

The formation of the Earth and Moon is believed to have occurred around **4.5 billion years** ago. The process can be summarized as follows:

- **Accretion**: Small particles in the early solar system collided and stuck together, forming larger objects called planetesimals and eventually protoplanets.
- **Giant Impact**: A Mars-sized protoplanet called **Theia** collided with the young Earth, causing a massive impact that ejected debris into space.
- **Formation of the Moon:** The debris from the impact began to orbit the Earth and eventually came together to create the Moon.
- **Differentiation**: Both the Earth and Moon underwent differentiation, where materials separated based on density. Heavier elements sank towards the core, while lighter elements rose to the surface, forming distinct layers.
- **Lunar Evolution:** The Moon cooled and solidified over time. It experienced volcanic activity and large impact events, leading to the formation of craters, basins, and other geological features like lunar maria.

**The moon has had a profound impact on the evolution of life on Earth:**

- **Water on Earth**: The planet that collided with Earth, ‘Theia’ came from the outer solar system and delivered large quantities of water to Earth.
- **Impact on Tectonic Plates**: The moon’s pull of gravity might have set our tectonic plates.
- **Impact of moon’s** **gravitational pull**: Moon’s gravitational pull helps transport heat away from the equator and towards the poles, fundamentally shaping the earth’s climate.
- **Impact on Earth’s rotation**: Moon also stabilises the Earth’s rotation on its axis by **slowing Earth’s rotation on its axis**.
    - The Moon’s presence **helps stabilize Earth’s axial tilt and its climate**. This stability has allowed for the **development of seasons,** which have had a significant impact on the distribution of water and the evolution of life.
- **Impact on Earth**: The moon’s presence **stabilizes Earth’s climate, transports heat and helps regulate the Earth’s rotation** on its axis.
- **Impact of Tides:** The regular movement of water that **exposes the land at the edge of the ocean,** could have encouraged **life to adapt and move from the oceans to land.**
- **Impact on biological cycle**: Lunar cycles affect the **reproductive cycles of marine life** and other animal behaviours.
    - The **laying and hatching of turtles’ eggs** depend on the timings of tides
    - Moonlight affects the **behaviour of nocturnal animals and triggers species-wide reproduction e.g., Corals**.

**Conclusion:**

Moon holds much significance for humankind from geological as well as space exploration points of view. India’s Chandrayaan 3 mission is a step in that direction to better understand the moon’s geology and its potential for humankind.

### [Challenges posed by sand and dust storms](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/15/challenges-posed-by-sand-and-dust-storms/)

#### **GS Paper 1/ 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Geophysical phenomena/Climate/Conservation, environmental pollution and degradation**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/world/road-to-2030-why-sand-dust-storms-pose-challenge-to-achieving-multiple-sdgs-90622#:~:text=Sand%20and%20dust%20storms%20often,contribute%20to%20climate%2Drelated%20impacts.)

 **Context:** According to the UN, sand and dust storms (SDS) have increased dramatically in frequency and severity in recent years.

**What is SDS?**

- They are **common meteorological hazards in arid and semi-arid regions**, usually caused by thunderstorms/ strong pressure gradients associated with cyclones, which **increase wind speed over a wide area.**
- These strong winds **lift large amounts of sand and dust from bare, dry soils** into the atmosphere, transporting them hundreds to thousands of km away.

**Impact:**

- **On weather/climate/environment:**
    - Dust particles act as **condensation nuclei** for cloud formation **affecting the amount and location of precipitation.**
    - Airborne dust functions in a manner similar to the **greenhouse effect**, which affects the energy reaching the Earth’s surface.
    - SDS are recurring environmental phenomena which reduce **air quality, and visibility.**
- **On human health:**
    - **Particles larger than 10 μm** are not breathable, and thus can only damage external organs.
    - **Particles smaller than 10 μm**, often get trapped in the nose, mouth and upper respiratory tract, and thus can be associated with respiratory disorders such as asthma, etc.
- **On the land and marine ecosystems:**
    - Surface dust deposits are a **source of micronutrients** for both continental and maritime ecosystems. **For example**, Saharan dust is thought to fertilise the Amazon rainforest.
    - But dust also has **many negative impacts on agriculture/food security**, including
        - Reducing crop yields by burying seedlings,
        - Causing loss of plant tissue,
        - Reducing photosynthetic activity and
        - Increasing soil erosion.

**Primary hotspots of the dust storm are:**

- Sahara Desert,
- Middle East,
- Taklamakan Desert in northwest China,
- Southwest Asia,
- Central Australia,
- Etosha and Makgadikgadi basins of southern Africa,
- Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia and
- Great Basin in the US

**Concerns raised by the UN:**

- **Around 2 million tonnes** of sand and dust enter the atmosphere annually.
- SDS often originate in dryland areas, which cover **41% of the Earth’s land surface** and comprise some of the most fragile ecosystems, highly susceptible to global climate change.
- **Human-induced climate change** has increased the frequency and intensity of SDS.
- The impact of SDS is felt in **all regions of the world**, both in developed and developing countries.
- The growing intensity and frequency of SDS **present a formidable challenge to achieving SDGs**.
- SDS are linked to at least 11 of 17 SDGs. These include –
    - SDG 1 on ending poverty,
    - SDG 2 on ending hunger,
    - SDG 3 on health for all,
    - SDG 6 on water and sanitation,
    - SDG 8 on inclusive and sustainable economic growth,
    - SDG 11 on sustainable cities,
    - SDG 13 on climate action and
    - SDG 15 focuses on combating desertification, land degradation.
- These will **especially affect Africa and the Middle East** where desertification is most common.
- However, **the global recognition of SDS as a hazard is generally low**.

**Steps taken/needed:**

- **The UN General Assembly recognised** (in 2015) that SDS pose a great challenge to the sustainable development of affected countries and regions.
- **The UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD)** observed the first-ever **International Day of Combatting Sand and Dust Storms** on July 12, 2023.
- **Achieving SDGs ⇄** Reducing the occurrence and impact of SDS in affected areas.
- **Arresting land degradation:**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ldn.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ldn.png)

- **The SDS policy and planning** should reduce societal vulnerability by mitigating the effects of wind erosion.
- **A multi-sectoral process bolstered by information-sharing** should involve short-and long-term interventions, engage multiple stakeholders and raise awareness of SDS.

**Conclusion: Addressing SDS requires an integrated approach**, which involves sustainable land management, climate change mitigation and adaptation, and disaster risk reduction including early warning systems and international cooperation.

 **Context**: Western Ghats has experienced a **5% loss in evergreen forest cover**, with an increase in built-up and agriculture areas, according to a s**patiotemporal** (belonging to both space and time or to space–time) analysis of land use.

**Key findings:**

- **Only 25% of the forest landmass consists** of interior forests, indicating fragmentation pressure and its impact on local ecology.
- The region witnessed **large-scale land cover changes during the past century** due to unplanned developmental activities with industrialisation and globalisation.
- Highlights **high ecological fragility in the area.**

**Significance**: The findings emphasize the **need for conservation measures and sustainable development** policies in the Western Ghats to address the threats to forests and water security in the region.

**What is Ecological fragility?**

It refers to the **vulnerability of an ecosystem to disturbance or damage**, often resulting in the loss of biodiversity and disruption of ecological processes. It represents the **delicate balance and sensitivity of natural systems** to human activities and environmental changes.

For example, **deforestation in a rainforest can disrupt the intricate web of species interactions**, causing species extinction and the loss of vital ecological functions such as carbon sequestration and water regulation.

**About the analysis:** 

**The Indian Institute of Science’s Energy and Wetlands Research Group** launched the Western Ghats Spatial Decision Support System (WGSDSS) to enhance governance transparency and aid in the management of the ecologically vital **Sahyadri hill ranges**. The system provides comprehensive information on **ecological, socio-economic, biodiversity**, and environmental aspects, supporting effective decision-making.

**About Western Ghats:**

The Western Ghats, also known as the Sahyadri Hills, is a **biodiversity hotspot in India** ( it is among **36 global biodiversity hotspots**). It is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is home to a rich and unique assemblage of flora and fauna.
