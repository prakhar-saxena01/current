### [Managing microplastic pollution in India](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/25/managing-microplastic-pollution-in-india/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Conservation, Environmental Pollution and Degradation**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/water/managing-microplastic-pollution-is-important-for-meeting-sustainable-development-goals-in-india-90789)

 **Context:** Microplastic pollution – a significant environmental problem, has not attracted much attention in India.

**Microplastics:**

- These are **tiny plastic particles** (less than 5 mm long) that result from both commercial product development (microbeads in personal care products, synthetic fibres from clothing, etc) and the breakdown of larger plastics.
- **They are found everywhere**, from terrestrial ecosystems to freshwater rivers, lakes, ponds, estuaries, seas and oceans, even in Antarctica.

**Threats posed by microplastics:**

- Microplastics are not only **toxic** for the ecosystems but also act as **vectors** to transport other toxic chemicals in the aquatic ecosystems.
- **As a pollutant**, microplastics are a significant **environmental problem** and pose risks to marine life, terrestrial organisms and **human health**.
- As a result, many scientists are using a new historical epoch – **Plasticene**, due to the global distribution and abundance of microplastics.

**Factors contributing to microplastic pollution in India:**

- **Rapid industrialisation, urbanisation and population growth** have led to increased plastic consumption and waste generation.
- **Inadequate waste management systems**, including limited recycling infrastructure and improper disposal practices. **For example,**
    - Municipal areas in India generate 133,760 metric tonnes per day (TPD) of municipal solid waste (MSW).
    - Of which only 91,152 TPD waste is collected and 25,884 TPD treated.
    - **Of which only 9,250 TPD plastic waste is recycled.**
- **The vast coastline and numerous rivers** make it susceptible to the transport of microplastics from inland areas to the marine environment.

**Challenges India is facing:**

- **Most populous country** in the world with a population of 1.42 billion → Demand for water is rising.
- **Access to water** plays a critical role in **all 17 SDGs** either directly or indirectly.
- **Misuse, poor management and contamination of freshwater systems** have amplified the water stress.
- Thus, achieving SDGs by 2030 is a mammoth task amid microplastic pollution.

**Some SDGs that have direct and intricate relations with water:**

- SDG 2: Zero hunger
- SDG 3: Good health and well-being
- SDG 6: Clean water and sanitation
- SDG 7: Affordable and clean energy
- SDG 14: Life below water
- SDG 15: Life on land

**Steps taken in India:**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/environment.png)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/environment.png)

- **The Plastic Waste Management Amendment Rules 2021** prohibited single-use plastic items by the end of 2022.
- **The permissible thickness of plastic carry bags** was increased from 50 to 75 microns and then 120 microns from December 31, 2022.
- **Several nonprofits and civil society organisations** (Bengaluru-based **Saahas**) are actively working to tackle the issue through research, advocacy and community engagement.

**Way ahead:**

- **Focus on the key targets of SDG 6:**
    - Achieving universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all.
    - Improve water quality by reducing pollution and increasing water treatment.
    - Increase water-use efficiency in all sectors and ensure sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater.
    - Implement integrated water resources management to support the sustainable use of water resources.
    - Protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes.
- **India should focus on improving waste management infrastructure**, promoting recycling and responsible consumption and raising awareness among the public and industries.
- **It is essential to implement stricter regulations**, enhance monitoring and research on microplastics and promote sustainable alternatives to single-use plastics.

**Conclusion:** It is important to note that managing microplastics is a complex task that requires a comprehensive approach involving government agencies, industries, communities and individuals working together to reduce plastic waste and protect the environment.

**In case of disaster, 3 kinds of assessment need to be conducted:**

- **Before the disaster:** A Hazard-Vulnerability-Capacity mapping to guide the preparedness activities most needed,
- **During Response:** A Rapid Needs Assessment (RNA) which can be completed in a day and point out the immediate needs of the affected population,
- **During Recovery and Reconstruction:** A detailed Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) which –
    - Highlights the long-term needs of the community and
    - Helps the administration **“build back better” and “update”** to mitigate against future disasters.

**Other Indian efforts towards reducing the risk of disasters:**

- **G20 Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) Working Group:** India has established the first G20 Working Group on DRR to elevate DRR as a priority for G20 through its presidency.
- **Expanding disaster early warning:** During Cyclone Biparjoy, effective systems for end-to-end early warning and action helped achieve zero deaths from the event in India.
- **UN Secretary General’s Early Warnings for All Initiative:** India is working to realise the goal of the initiative, which seeks to create universal coverage for everyone by the end of 2027.
- **Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CRDI):** India launched CRDI with the UN in 2019, to spur policy development and capacity support for disaster resilient infrastructure, especially in developing countries.

**Best practices – Disaster response in Odisha:**

- **Sneha Abhiyaan:** Under this, self-help groups (SHGs) in the village are entrusted with managing cyclone shelters, including the distribution of cooked food.
- **Mamta Gruhas:** These safe spaces provide comprehensive care for women, children and other vulnerable sections of society.
- **Training and capacity building of frontline workers (ASHAs, SHGs):** SDRF provides training in first aid, shelter management, rescue operations, government regulations concerning trafficking and compensation norms.

**Way ahead:**

- To build resilience within affected communities, it is essential to focus on **long-term rehabilitation.**
- **The leadership of women collectives** plays a vital role in this process.

**Conclusion:** As the world is at the midpoint of the **Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030,** a renewed sense of urgency and a people-centred approach can significantly reduce disaster losses by 2030.

### [Sixth Person (Geneva patient) cured of HIV](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/25/sixth-person-geneva-patient-cured-of-hiv/)

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/health-wellness/geneva-hiv-patient-cured-stem-cell-transplant-8854081/)

 **Context**: A sixth person, known as the **Geneva patient,** has likely been cured of HIV after receiving a **stem cell transplant for leukaemia**. His virus level remained undetectable 20 months after discontinuing antiretroviral therapy.

- However, his **cells are still susceptible to HIV,** leaving the possibility of the virus returning.

**What is a stem cell transplant?** 

A stem cell transplant (SCT) is a **medical procedure in which healthy stem cells** are infused into a patient to **replace damaged or diseased stem cells**. Stem cells are special human cells that can replicate and differentiate into various types of cells in the body. The transplant aims to **restore the body’s ability to produce healthy blood cells**, boost the immune system, and treat certain diseases like **leukaemia and lymphoma.**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/work.jpg?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/work.jpg)

**Can SCT be used for treating all HIV patients?**

Stem cell transplant is **unlikely to become a routine treatment for HIV** due to challenges in finding **matching donors and the mutation being mainly found in Caucasians**. Stem cell transplantation also comes with risks, such as **the risk of patient rejection** and the virus finding other ways to infect cells.

**Why Caucasians are able to recover while other races are not?** 

The recovery of HIV through stem cell transplantation has been **more commonly observed in Caucasians because a specific gene mutation known as CCR5 delta 32** is more prevalent in this racial group. People who inherit **two copies of this mutation** (one from each parent) are **naturally resistant to certain strains of HIV** due to the lack of receptors on their immune cells that the virus uses to enter and infect the cells.

**Effective antiretroviral therapy remains the primary treatment for HIV**, suppressing the virus and allowing **CD4 immune cell count to bounce back**. Although it doesn’t remove the virus completely, **it reduces viral particles** to undetectable levels and prevents transmission to others.

Other patients who have achieved HIV remission through stem cell transplantation include the Berlin patient, the London patient, and the New York patient. Stem cell therapy using **umbilical cord and adult stem cells may make transplants possible in people from other races as well.**

 **Context:** India is taking its **first step towards introducing Controlled Human Infection Studies (CHIS),** a research model used in other countries for vaccine and treatment development.

**What is CHIS?**

It is a research model used to **intentionally expose healthy volunteers to pathogens in a controlled environment** to study diseases and develop vaccines and treatments for diseases like malaria, typhoid, and dengue. The goal is to gain insights into **disease pathogenesis** and find efficient and cost-effective ways to prevent and treat infectious diseases.

**The issues with CHIS (Controlled Human Infection Studies) include:**

- **Ethical Sensitivity:** CHIS involves intentionally exposing healthy volunteers to pathogens, raising concerns about deliberate harm and protecting participants’ rights.
- **Disproportionate Payment**: Concerns about inducements and potential financial incentives for volunteers to participate in risky studies.
- **Third-Party Risk**: The risk of transmission of the pathogen to individuals outside the study, leading to potential community spread.
- **Research with Vulnerable Participants:** Ensuring that vulnerable individuals, such as pregnant women or children, are not exposed to undue risks during CHIS.
- **Technical and Clinical Challenges**: Ensuring proper scientific procedures and safety protocols are followed in the controlled environment.
- **Legal Contentions:** Addressing potential legal issues related to participant consent and liability.
- **Socio-Cultural Context**: Considering unique socio-cultural factors that may impact the acceptability and feasibility of CHIS in different communities.

**The Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) Bioethics Unit** has introduced a consensus policy statement, open for public comment, to address the ethical concerns associated with CHIS. The aim is to conduct research in India **while protecting human participants and ensuring ethical principles** are upheld.

 **Context:** The invasive weed Ludwigia peruviana is **threatening elephant habitats** and foraging areas in Valparai, Tamil Nadu.

**About Ludwigia Peruviana:**

The Ludwigia peruviana, **an aquatic plant with pale yellowish flowers**, is causing significant challenges in **various swampy areas worldwide**. Originally introduced as an **ornamental plant for its tiny yellow flowers in Tamil Nadu**, it now grows rapidly, particularly in wetlands, due to the pre-monsoon temperature and monsoon rains. This fast growth is disrupting the **balance of perennial foraging grounds**, hindering the growth of grass and **native plants that elephants** and other animals such as Gaur, rely on for food.

- **Origin**: It is popularly **called primrose willow**, it is a native of **Central and South America**.
- It is among the **22 priority invasive plants in Tamil Nadu**.
- It has infested the **majority of the hill station’s swamps**, locally known as **vayals** .
