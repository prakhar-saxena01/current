### [Senior advocates in the SC](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/18/senior-advocates-in-the-sc/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Structure, organisation and Functioning of the Judiciary**

 **Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/guidelines-designation-senior-advocates-8843877/)

**Context:** The SC has published new guidelines for the designation of senior advocates practising mainly in the Apex Court.

**Background: The new guidelines come after the SC’s ruling** seeking modification in the guidelines issued by the SC (in 2018) aftermath of its **Indira Jaisingh ruling (2017)**.

**How were advocates designated before the 2017 ruling?**

- **The Advocates Act 1961** states two classes of advocates – **senior advocates and other advocates.**
- A senior advocate **must be a deserving candidate** [ by virtue of his ability, standing at the Bar, or special knowledge or experience in law] in the opinion of the SC or an HC].
- It was the **Chief Justice and the judges who designates** an advocate as a ‘senior’ advocate.

**What did the court decide in the Indira Jaising case?**

- Indira Jaising (India’s first woman Senior Advocate) challenged the existing process as **opaque, arbitrary and fraught with nepotism.**
- The SC (in 2017) decided to lay down guidelines for itself and all HCs on the process of designating senior advocates.
- It decided the setting up of a **permanent committee and a permanent secretariat.**
- **Permanent secretariat –**
    - Is a body tasked with receiving and compiling all applications for designation.
    - **Published** the proposal for designation on the official website of the concerned court, inviting suggestions and views.
    - **Forward** these suggestions to the permanent committee for scrutiny.
- **The committee then interview the candidate** and made an overall evaluation based on **a point system** that gave marks for –
    - years of practice
    - pro-bono work undertaken
    - judgements
    - publications and
    - a personality test
- Once a candidate’s name was approved, **it was forwarded to the Full Court to decide on the basis of the majority.**
- **The Full Court could also recall** the designation of a senior advocate.
- The SC had acknowledged (in its 2017 ruling) that the **guidelines are not exhaustive** and left them open for consideration by this Court.

**The Guidelines to Regulate the Conferment of Designation of Senior Advocates 2018:**

- These were released **to bring greater transparency** to the designation process.
- The guidelines **discouraged the system of voting by secret ballot**, except in cases where it was unavoidable.
- **A permanent committee** was created and empowered with powers of conferment.
    - **The CJI-chaired committee** was to consist of two senior-most SC judges, the Attorney General of India, and a member of the Bar nominated by the chair and other members.
    - **The Committee was to meet at least twice a year.**
- **The CJI or any other judge could recommend** the name of an advocate for designation.
- Alternatively, **advocates could submit their applications** to the Permanent Secretariat.

**Issues with the 2018 guidelines:**

- **The point-based system** (which awarded 40% weightage to publications, personality and suitability) is **subjective, ineffective** and dilutes the esteem and dignity of the honour being conferred traditionally.
- **The rampant circulation of bogus journals** could be published by paying a nominal amount.
- **Discontinuation of a secret ballot** disincentivises the judges from expressing their views about the suitability of any candidate.

### [Reforms in India Railway](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/18/reforms-in-india-railway/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus: Economy: Infrastructure**

**Source:** [**BS**](https://www.business-standard.com/opinion/editorial/speed-and-strategy-123071600605_1.html)

 **Context:** The launch of the **Vande Bharat trains has received attention**, but overall improvements in **railway services are necessary**.

**Challenges hindering the development of Railways in India:**

- **Congested networks:** Overstretched infrastructure with 60% plus routes being more than 100 per cent utilized, leading to a reduction in the average speed of passenger and freight trains.
- **Efficiency:** Low efficiency of the Railways in terms of the human resources it employs, and their capacity.
- **The decline in the growth of internal revenue generation**: A decline in the growth of internal revenue generation has meant that Railways has been funding its capital expenditure through budgetary support from the central government and borrowings.
    - While the support from the central government has mostly remained consistent, Railways’ borrowings have been increasing.
- **Centralised decision making:** Currently, decision-making in Railways is centralised.  The Railway Board has the powers of policy-making, operations, and regulation.  Railway zones have very limited powers with regard to raising their own revenue.
    - Therefore, they are unable to contribute more effectively towards improving Railways’ revenue.
- **Safety and poor quality of service delivery:** There have been a number of accidents and safety issues. However, it has declined off late.
    - Poor cleanliness of trains and stations, delays in booking/train departures and arrivals and in booking tickets are key issues.
- **Competition from the Aviation Industry:** Due to an increased quality of life and rapid lifestyle changes necessitated by an increase in personal disposable income, the Indian railways are also facing stiff competition from airlines as a means of transportation and travel which doesn’t bode well for the railways.
- **A vicious cycle for Railways:** Poor finances of Railways had led to low investment in infrastructure.  Low investment means Railways’ infrastructure and services take a hit (resulting in low speed, delays, and safety issues).
    - Poor infrastructure and services result in loss of remunerative business for Railways which leads to further deterioration of finances.

**Measures taken by Indian Railways:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Measure**|**Description**|
|**New Trains**|·        The benefits of the Vande Bharat trains include **stimulating local manufacturing** and providing an upgraded travel experience<br><br>·        **Vistadome Trains**: Running in most scenic routes and improves tourism|
|**Special Freight Train Operations Scheme**|Allows private enterprises to run freight trains from their private terminals, leading to speedier cargo evacuation.|
|**Mission Raftaar**|Aims to **double the average speed of freight trains** and increase the average speed of **Superfast/Mail/Express trains by 25 kmph.**|
|**Amrit Bharat Station Scheme**|Aims to equip stations with facilities inspired by the mega-upgradation of marquee stations such as New Delhi and Ahmedabad, but at a lower cost.|
|**Indian Railway Management Service (IRMS)**|Marks a paradigm shift in the management of Indian Railways, aiming to rationalize the top-heavy bureaucracy.|
|**TCAS (Train Collision Avoidance System)**|An indigenously developed system to minimize accidents caused by human error.|
|**Measures to expedite project commissioning**|·        Assured finance through extra-budgetary resources for throughput enhancement works.<br><br>·        Emphasis on proper project preparation, advanced land acquisition, **EPC contracts, mechanization in construction**, and intensive project monitoring to increase the pace of commissioning.|

**Role of** **National Rail Plan (NRP) for 2030:** Indian Railways have recently prepared a National Rail Plan (NRP) for India – 2030 to create a ‘future ready’ Railway system by 2030. The objective of the Plan is to create capacity ahead of demand, which in turn would also cater to future growth in demand right up to 2050.

**Features of the plan:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Feature**|**Description**|
|**Focus on freight:**|Increase the modal share of Railways in **freight to 45% by 2030.**|
|Substantially **reduce transit time by increasing the average speed of freight trains to 50 kmph.**|
|**National Rail Plan, Vision 2024:**|Accelerated implementation **of critical projects by 2024.**|
|100% electrification and multi-tracking of congested routes.|
|Upgradation of speed to **160 kmph on Delhi-Howrah and Delhi-Mumbai routes.**|
|Upgradation **of speed to 130 kmph on all other Golden** Quadrilateral-Golden Diagonal (GQ/GD) routes.|
|**Elimination of all Level Crossings** on GQ/GD routes.|

**Conclusion**

The need of the hour is to find a balanced solution that would incorporate the pros of both private and government enterprises and enhance the image of Indian Railways as it continues to serve the world’s largest democracy.

### [Local Currency Settlement System (LCSS)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/18/local-currency-settlement-system-lcss/)

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/india-uae-establish-local-currency-settlement-system-explained-8840067/)

**Context: India and the United Arab Emirates (UAE)** signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to establish **Local Currency Settlement System (LCSS)** for using local currencies, **the Indian rupee (INR), and the UAE Dirham (AED), for cross-border transactions.**

- **LCSS will** promote **the use of INR and AED for current accounts and permitted capital account transactions between the two countries**.
- India-UAE trade was approx **USD 85 billion in 2022**. UAE is **India’s third-largest** trading partner while India is UAE 2nd largest trading partner.

**What is a Local Currency Settlement System (LCSS)?**

The Local Currency Settlement System (LCSS) is a mechanism that enables **cross-border transactions between two countries** to be conducted in their respective domestic currencies.

- It allows **exporters and importers to invoice** and make payments in their local currencies, reducing the reliance on a third-party currency such as the US dollar.

**For example**,

Let’s consider a scenario where a **company in India exports goods** to a company in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). With the LCSS in place, the Indian exporter can issue an invoice in Indian rupees (INR), and the UAE importer can make the payment in UAE dirhams (AED).

**Advantages:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Advantages**|**Examples**|
|**Reduction in foreign exchange costs**|An Indian exporter can **invoice in INR, and a UAE importer can pay in AED,** eliminating the need for currency conversion to a third-party currency like USD.|
|**Mitigation of exchange rate risks**|Companies can **hedge exchange rate risks** by transacting in local currencies, limiting losses caused by fluctuations in exchange rates.|
|**Improved transaction efficiency**|Transaction processes can be streamlined as **parties can invoice and settle payments in their domestic currencies**, reducing complexities and time delays.|
|||
|**Enhanced trade and investment opportunities**|The use of LCSS promotes **bilateral trade and investment between** India and UAE by facilitating easier and more efficient cross-border transactions.|
|||
|**Optimized remittances**|Indian residents in the UAE can **send remittances in INR**, benefiting from **lower transaction costs and faster settlement times**.|

**Other agreements between India and UAE:**

- The two countries agreed to **link India’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI) with UAE’s Instant Payment Platform (IPP)**.
- The two countries agreed to **link their respective Card Switches** vis-a-vis RuPay switch and UAESWITCH to enable **mutual acceptance of domestic cards** and processing of these card transactions.
- **India’s Structured Financial Messaging System (SFMS)** will be linked with messaging system in UAE to ease their financial messaging.
- Also, India will establish an **IIT-Delhi campus in Abu Dhabi**, which would be the second IIT abroad after Tanzania.

 **Context:** Climate change is aiding the **spread of the deadly Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus** in Europe, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

**What is CCHF?**

Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a viral disease transmitted by ticks (Hyalomma ticks). It can also be contracted through contact with infected animal tissues.

- **Background**: Congo fever was **first discovered in Crimea in 1944**and was later named as **Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever**.
- **Threat**: CCHF outbreaks pose a public health threat, as the virus can lead to **epidemics** and has a **high fatality rate**.
- **Symptoms**: It includes fever, muscle ache, headache, and bleeding.
- **Vaccine**: There is currently **no vaccine for CCHF**, and treatment involves **managing symptoms** and using **antiviral drugs in some cases.**
- **Region**: It is endemic to Africa, the Balkan countries, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.

**How Climate change is contributing to its spread?**

Rising temperatures and disrupted climate patterns have **created favourable conditions** for viruses not typically found in colder climates. Climate change contributes to the spread of diseases by expanding the habitat of disease-carrying insects, altering water habitats, and causing changes in animal migration patterns, increasing human contact with infected animals.

 **Context: Researchers from the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences (ICTS), Bengaluru, the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune**, and the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), have proposed a **new method to determine the Hubble constant, a value critical in understanding the universe’s expansion rate.**

**About the Universe:**

The universe, **born from the Big Bang around 13.8 billion years ago**, has been expanding, with its expansion rate initially rapid and then slowing down. However, **about five to six billion years ago, dark energy caused the universe’s expansion to accelerate again.**

**What is Universe Expansion Dispute?** 

The dispute surrounding the expansion of the universe centres on determining the **precise rate at which it is expanding, known as the Hubble constant**. Multiple methods have been used to calculate this constant, including analyzing the **brightness of supernovae**, studying the cosmic microwave background, and observing gravitational waves.

However, these methods have **provided conflicting results**, with some measurements reporting **higher values than others**. This discrepancy has led to a **crisis in cosmology**, as scientists seek to reconcile these differing measurements and understand the true rate of expansion.

**What is the new method?**

In an effort to address this dispute, researchers from various institutions have proposed new methods, such as **using lensed gravitational waves**, to independently estimate the Hubble constant. The researchers believe that **upcoming gravitational-wave detectors** could identify lensed gravitational waves, which can then be used to calculate the Hubble constant more accurately.

**Source:** [**DST**](https://dst.gov.in/low-cost-perovskite-solar-cells-superior-thermal-and-moisture-stability-developed-indigenously)

 **Context**: Indian scientists at the **International Advanced Research Centre for Powder Metallurgy and New Materials (ARCI), Hyderabad**, have developed highly **stable, low-cost Carbon-based perovskite solar cells (CPSCs)**.

- These solar cells overcome the challenges of degradation during operation, **making them suitable for large-scale commercialization.**

**What are Perovskite solar cells (PSCs)?**

 Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are a **type of solar cell that utilizes perovskite materials as the light-harvesting active layer to convert sunlight into electricity**. The most commonly used perovskite material **in solar cells is methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3)**.

**Issues with PSCs?**

 **Perovskite solar cells (PSCs)** **face stability issues when exposed to heat, moisture, and other environmental factors**.

**Solution:**

The scientists engineered **MaPbI3 to enhance thermal stability by incorporating Guanidinium iodide (GuI)** and moisture stability by using **5-amino valeric acid iodide (5-AVAI) for surface passivation**. This breakthrough can **resolve stability concerns** and reduce fabrication costs, potentially **accelerating the commercialization of perovskite-based niche products.**

**Significance of PSCs:**

 They have gained significant attention in recent years due to their potential to revolutionize the solar energy industry, **offering advantages such as low-cost manufacturing, high efficiency, and the ability to be printed onto flexible substrates.**

 **Context**: In early July this year, the Ghaggar River and its tributaries in Haryana, caused widespread devastation after reclaiming their floodplains.

- The river, including its tributaries **Tangri, Markanda, and others**, were previously considered dead and heavily encroached upon. However, due to heavy monsoon rains in the **Shivalik hills,** the rivers flooded their catchment areas and breached their banks, resulting in significant losses.
- Additionally, unscientific and illegal mining has harmed the natural balance of rivers like the Ghaggar and Yamuna.
