### [Strengthening Multilateral Development Banks: The Triple Agenda](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/21/strengthening-multilateral-development-banks-the-triple-agenda/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Important International Institutions, agencies and fora – their Structure, Mandate**

**Source:** [**CGDEV**](https://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/The_Triple_Agenda_G20-IEG_Report_Volume1_2023.pdf)

 **Context:** An Independent Expert Group (IEG) that was commissioned by the Indian G20 Presidency has released the ‘Strengthening Multilateral Development Banks: The Triple Agenda’ report.

**What are Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs)?**

- An MDB is **an international financial institution** consisting of member nations from developed and developing countries.
- **MDBs provide loans and grants** to member (especially poor/ developing) nations **to fund projects that support their social and economic development.**

**The emergence of MDBs:**

- **At the end of WWII**, delegates from 44 countries met in Bretton Woods (US) to agree upon a series of new rules for international cooperation and reconstruction.
- This led to the creation of the **IMF and World Bank Group (WBG)** in **1944**.
- The WB was responsible for providing **financial assistance for the post-war reconstruction and economic development** of the less developed countries.
- **While the WBG is the oldest and the largest MDB**, there are ~15-16 prominent MDBs and Regional development banks (RDBs) today.

**The role played by MDGs:**

- MDBs have a key role to support the needed reforms and resources.
- **They work with governments and the private sector** to create the conditions for investment and transformation.
- They are the most effective institutions **to provide low-cost, long-maturity financing,** to mitigate and share risks (in the most efficient way) faced by private investors.

**Challenges faced by MDBs:**

- **No longer suited to address the emerging global challenges:** They lack resources, cultural ethos, methods and will to address the challenges like **climate change and pandemics.**
- **They are in a state of stagnation:** Trapped in their procedures, approach and methods of work and resistant to structural changes.
- Therefore, to transform development, the MDBs will have to transform themselves.

**Recommendations of the IEG report – Triple agenda to harness the potential of MDBs:**

**The three elements of this agenda are:**

- Adopting a triple mandate of eliminating extreme poverty, boosting shared prosperity, and contributing to global public goods;
- Tripling sustainable lending levels by 2030; and
- **Creating a third funding mechanism** which would permit flexible and innovative arrangements for purposefully engaging with investors willing to support elements of the MDB agenda.

**How can it be achieved?**

- Effective implementation of the triple agenda **requires important changes in the ways that MDBs operate**.
- **MDBs must become effective agents** in all developing countries for integrating development and climate agendas.
- **They must work with governments and the private sector** to reduce, share and manage risks and thereby bring down the cost of capital.
- **They must change their culture**, become more client-responsive, and take more risks.
- **Timelines** for project preparation should be shrunk and **procedures**
- They must also increase the scale and nature of their activities.

**Way ahead:**

- One of the greatest opportunities for transformation is in **MDB’s engagement with the private sector.**
- **The MDB system must become more than the sum of its individual entities**. Their strength has come from **heterogeneity**, which permits innovations in different parts of the system.

**Conclusion:** While the reform agenda needs to be decisively put on track, there is a need for an independent monitoring group to encourage the full implementation of recommendations and report to G20 on progress.

### [Facilitating Investment in the Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/21/facilitating-investment-in-the-sustainable-development-goals/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: Government Policies and Investment**

**Source:** [**UNCTAD**](https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/diaepcb2022d3_en.pdf)

**Context:** The UNCTAD released a new publication – “Facilitating Investment in the Sustainable Development Goals”.

**About the publication: It is part of UNCTAD’s investment advisory series**, which provides practical advice and case studies of best policy practices for **attracting FDI that contribute to sustainable development.**

**Highlights of the publication:**

- **To shore up funding for the UN SDGs**, countries need more proactive and tailored services for investors.
- **An estimated $4 trillion** is required in developing countries annually to achieve the SDGs. This can be made possible through foreign investment**.**
- **The role of the investment promotion agencies (IPAs)** can be significant, as they are the focal point for government-wide efforts to facilitate foreign investment.

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/IPA.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/IPA.png)

**Investment promotion vs facilitation:**

- **Investment promotion** is meant to attract potential investors that have not yet selected an investment destination.
- Whereas facilitation starts at the pre-establishment phase **when an investor shows interest in a location.**

**Why does investment facilitation matter?**

- **Investment facilitation aims** at making it easier for investors to establish and expand their investments, as well as conduct their day-to-day business in host countries.
- **This can happen by providing** relevant information, making rules and regulations more transparent and streamlining administrative procedures for investors.

**How can IPAs bolster SDG implementation through investment facilitation?**

- **By ensuring** that investment facilitation services are inclusive. This will address the specific needs and opportunities of SDG-related sectors, and specific investor groups.
- When establishing a project, **IPAs can assist in filling in the information gap** by pointing investors to potential partners and incentive programmes.
- **They can forge new partnerships** with local governments and national ministries dealing with SDG-related investment opportunities.
- To stay competitive in a digitalised economy post-COVID-19, **IPAs have increasingly turned to digital platforms** to conduct many of their promotional and facilitation services.

**Challenges:**

- While sustainable investment continues to grow, **such financing remains heavily concentrated in the world’s richest economies.**
- **Most of it goes to sectors related to climate change adaptation** (renewable energy), and far less towards sectors such as health, education, water and sanitation.

**Way ahead:**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SDG.png)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SDG.png)

- **Developing SDG project pipelines** by prioritising sectors where funding is needed the most.
- **Defining related targets** and preparing relevant investment project profiles.
- **There is a need for stronger knowledge management** of insights and lessons learned on SDG investment.

**Best practice – Invest India:**

- **The IPA** has an online Industrial Land Bank that showcases all available land in several subregions that can be used for development.
- The agency is in the process of **aggregating** the tool at the national level.

**Conclusion:** Investment is particularly important for SDGs-related investment, which often requires more proactive and more tailored services for investors than traditional investment.

### [Credit Guarantee Scheme for Livestock Sector](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/21/credit-guarantee-scheme-for-livestock-sector/)

**Source:** [**PIB**](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1940935)

 **Context:** The Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry, and Dairying has launched the **“Credit Guarantee Scheme” under the Animal Husbandry Infrastructure Development Fund (AHIDF)** to support the **rural economy by leveraging Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in the Livestock sector**.

**What is Credit Guarantee Fund?**

The Credit Guarantee Fund is a **financial mechanism that provides risk mitigation** for lending institutions, by lending to individuals or businesses, even **without sufficient collateral.** If the borrower defaults, the **fund reimburses the lending institution** for the guaranteed portion of the loan.

**The Credit Guarantee Fund Trust,** established in **March 2021**, is India’s **first-ever fund trust** under the Credit Guarantee Scheme for the agriculture and Animal Husbandry sector. It aims to significantly **increase the number of MSMEs benefiting** from the **AHIDF scheme** and strengthen the **ecosystem for collateral-free credit from banks**.

**Features of the Scheme:**

Under the scheme, the Department of Animal Husbandry & Dairying has established a **Credit Guarantee Fund Trust of Rs. 750.00 crores (**under **NABARD)**, which **provides credit guarantee** coverage of **up to 25% for credit facilities** extended to MSMEs by eligible lending institutions.

**Advantages:**

This initiative aims to improve access to finance for underserved livestock entrepreneurs, especially first-generation and underprivileged individuals who lack collateral security.

**About AHIDF**

It is a **Central Sector Scheme** launched by the Ministry of Animal Husbandry, Fisheries, and Dairying. Its aim is to **encourage investments** in dairy and meat processing infrastructure, as well as animal feed plants.

 **Context:** A remarkable fossil d**iscovered in north-eastern China sheds light on the complex interactions between mammals and dinosaurs during the Mesozoic Era**, around 125 million years ago.

- The fossil shows a small badger-like **mammal called Repenomamus robustus attacking a medium-sized, plant-eating dinosaur named Psittacosaurus lujiatunensis**.
- The fossil provides evidence of a **smaller mammal preying on a larger dinosaur, challenging the traditional belief that dinosaurs always ate smaller mammals.**

The discovery suggests that **Mesozoic food webs were more complex than previously thought**, with some mammals being **active predators rather than just prey**. This find also challenges the idea that **mammals only scavenged dinosaur carcasses**. The interaction between **Repenomamus and Psittacosaurus is a unique example of a mammal preying on a dinosaur.**
