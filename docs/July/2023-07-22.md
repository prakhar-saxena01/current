### [Use of women as weapons of assault in a conflict](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/22/use-of-women-as-weapons-of-assault-in-a-conflict/)

#### **GS Paper 1**

 **Syllabus:** **Women-related issues**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/who-is-accountable-in-manipur-8850423/)

**Context:** A video of two Kuki women being paraded naked by a mob during the ongoing clashes in Manipur is circulating on social media.

**The larger question:** Women’s bodies have become sites of male violence, especially during communally charged conflicts.

**Reasons behind this grim reality:** India’s social contract [an implicit agreement among the members of a society to cooperate for social benefits, by sacrificing some individual freedom for state protection] seems to be melting.

**Two aspects of this meltdown:**

- The systems of violence in and around Manipur.
- The structures of silence around it.

**The systems of violence in and around Manipur:**

- The state is witnessing civil strife.
- **Social cleavages** between Meitei and Zo-Kuki communities have turned into a **partition** with well over a hundred dead, and thousands displaced.
- **Even the state administration stands partitioned**. Meitei police officers don’t operate in the hills, and Kuki-Zo officers don’t operate in the Valley.
- Essentially, **India is witnessing fresh partitions** and associated armed ethnic mobilisation in Northeast India.

**Such systems of violence are a by-product of** Competing desires for regional hegemony – demands for access to resources and power within the Union and **vote-bank politics**.

**The structures of silence:**

- It relates to what feminist scholars called **systemic violence against women** in Manipur.
- It took **a leaked video and associated public shock** for Manipur police to order an investigation.

**The issue of gender-based violence in conflicts:**

- Unfortunately, the issue **has not received adequate attention** in the discourse on gender equality and sustainable development.
- Sexual violence in conflict zones has often been regarded as an inevitable by-product of civil strife/ war and the **perpetrators of violence have seldom been punished.**

**What needs to be done?**

- **Addressing the deeply entrenched patriarchal attitudes** of the administration (say, police) to improve reporting and conviction rates.
- **Bridging the gap** between gender-based violence laws.
- **SDG 5 calls for ending violence against women and girls** in public and private spheres. As India is committed to the achievement of SDGs, **the governments need to take a tough stance** against the perpetrators of violence (in scenarios like Manipur).

**Conclusion:**

- India’s social contract seems to be weakening because wrongdoers in power aren’t being held accountable.
- Whether it is Manipur or Delhi, where India’s wrestling champions have been fighting for justice against sexual harassment by those in power, **the only way to deliver justice is to ensure accountability.**

### [ED’s powers to arrest and seek custody](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/22/eds-powers-to-arrest-and-seek-custody/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus: Statutory bodies**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/explained-senthilbalaji-case-what-has-the-sc-said-about-eds-powers-to-arrest-and-seek-custody-in-the-past/article67089535.ece)

 **Context:** The Madras High Court **upheld the legality of Tamil Nadu Minister V. Senthilbalaji’s arrest by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in a money-laundering case** linked to a **cash-for-jobs scam.**

**HC observations in the case:**

- **ED can subject any person accused in a case booked under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) to custodial interrogation**
- **ED officials are not police officers** as per the law laid down by the Supreme Court in **Vijay Madanlal Choudhary v. Union of India (2022)**

**Previously,**

 **In Central Bureau of Investigation v. Anupam J. Kulkarni (1992),** the Supreme Court laid down the law that **no police custody can be allowed beyond the first 15 days** from the date of arrest; any further remand during an investigation can only be in judicial custody.

However, SC (in April this year) said that **money laundering is an independent offence**; if an arrest is possible then seeking custody for further investigation is permissible. Also, SC has said previously that **interim protection granted against CBI action** cannot operate against **the ED** even if the underlying allegations are similar.

**What is Custodial interrogation?**

It refers to the **questioning of a suspect or accused by law enforcement** authorities while they are in their custody or under arrest. Under the Indian Constitution and the Indian Penal Code (IPC), **custodial interrogation is permissible**, but it must be carried out in accordance with the **rights and protections granted to individuals under Article 20(3)** of the Constitution and Section 161(2) of the IPC, which safeguard **against self-incrimination during questioning.**

**Difference between Police and Judicial Custody:**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Aspect**|**Police Custody**|**Judicial Custody**|
|**Definition**|The accused is held in custody under the **police’s authority and supervision.**|The accused is held in custody under the order of a **judicial authority (court).**|
|**Purpose**|Police custody is **primarily for investigation and interrogation purposes.**|Judicial custody is for the **period between trial hearings or during the trial.**|
|**Duration**|In India, police custody generally lasts for a **maximum of 15 days,** as per the Supreme Court’s ruling.|Judicial custody can last until the **conclusion of the trial,** depending on the case’s complexity and duration.|
|**Role of Magistrate**|A magistrate’s approval is not required for police custody.|**A magistrate’s approval** is necessary to extend judicial custody beyond a certain period.|
|**Example**|In a murder case, the accused is arrested by the police and taken into police custody for interrogation.|After the police complete their initial investigation, the accused is presented before a magistrate, who remands them to **judicial custody until the trial begins.**|

**Way forward:**

While the ED has been given **expansive powers under PMLA**, there must be a balance between these **powers and adherence to constitutional provisions** to prevent political misuse.

### [Why is the oral polio vaccine still crucial to eradicate polio?](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/22/why-is-the-oral-polio-vaccine-still-crucial-to-eradicate-polio/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Issues related to health**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/oral-poliovirus-vaccine-role-disease-transmission/article67105487.ece#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20being%20inexpensive,called%20the%20mucosal%20immune%20response).)

**Context:** It seems that the last mile to realising the dream of a polio-free world is going to be challenging.

**Why?**

- **The US, UK and Israel recently reported polio cases** in unvaccinated people after having been polio-free for more than a decade.
- Their silent outbreaks in countries with **excellent sanitation and hygiene infrastructure have raised eyebrows**, adding a new dimension to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI).

**Polioviruses:** These are **enteroviruses** that are transmitted primarily by the **faecal-oral route**. There are **different types of polio vaccines** available.

**The oral polio vaccine (OPV)**: It is a live attenuated vaccine, that contains weakened polioviruses (all three types – 1, 2, and 3) to induce an immune response in the human body without causing disease.

**The advantages of the OPV:**

- **Inexpensive and easy to administer** to a large population and can help prevent transmission.
- **It triggers a robust immune response** in the gut lining (called the mucosal immune response) in addition to the significant immune response in the blood (the systemic immune response).
- **It is excellent at preventing disease** as well as person-to-person transmission of the virus.
- **It is also easier to manufacture** as the “seed virus” required for the vaccine is an attenuated (weakened form) virus.

**Drawbacks of the OPV:**

- **Its ‘uptake’ by the immune system** after being administered is not as good as is desirable, especially in developing countries like India.
- **The OPV can reverse the virus’s neurovirulence in rare cases**, leading to vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP).
- When the virus’s ability to jump from one person to another is restored, the result can be **vaccine-derived paralytic poliomyelitis** (VDPVs).

**The inactivated polio vaccine (IPV):**

- It contains inactivated polioviruses (all three types) and is administered by **injection**.
- It **induces a strong systemic immune response**, thus protecting against paralytic poliomyelitis, **without any risk of causing VAPP or VDPV**.
- **Its downside** is that it hardly elicits mucosal immunity and is thus **unable to prevent silent infections and transmission**. So, in the event of an outbreak, only the OPV is used.
- Also, manufacturing the IPV requires **a high level of biosafety measures**, because wild viruses are chemically inactivated.
- As a result, most economically developing countries are unable to produce it locally and are **forced to import it from richer countries.**

**A global switch to tackle the disadvantages of both vaccines:**

- **90% of VAPP and VDPV** cases have been due to poliovirus type 2 and this virus was eradicated worldwide in 1999.
- As a result, the **OPV has attenuated versions of types 1 and 3** of the viruses (since April 2016).
- This was accompanied by the **introduction of IPV** in countries that still depended on OPV in their national immunisation programmes.

**Risks associated with this global switch:** The number of VDPV cases increased after April 2016 – the cases in the US, UK and Israel were all VDPVs

**Why did the global switch fail?**

- Limited supply/ availability of the IPV due to a sudden increase in the demand for IPV after the switch
- Cost/ logistics
- As the new OPV lacked the type-2 poliovirus, **the population immunity against the type-2 virus dropped**, giving the virus a new lease of life.
- **The interruption in routine immunisation** during COVID-19 also played a part in increasing the fraction of unvaccinated and/or under-vaccinated individuals.

**How can OPV help?**

- A child vaccinated with only the IPV will resist the virus’s ability to cause a paralytic disease, **but will still be at risk of being infected**, contributing to silent transmission of both vaccine-derived and wild polioviruses.
- **Hence, it would be dangerous and unethical to discontinue OPV in a hasty manner.**

**The success story of India:**

- **The polio vaccination programme** has successfully reduced the prevalence of polio cases by 99.9% worldwide since it was launched in 1988.
- **On 13 January 2023, India completed 12 polio-free years** – a remarkable achievement that was made as a result of consistent, determined efforts and genuine commitment at all levels.
- Since the transmission of wild poliovirus is rampant in India’s neighbouring countries (mainly Pakistan), it has persisted with **pulse polio rounds** that administer OPV.

**Way ahead:**

- **New alternatives:** Efforts are on to develop better polio vaccines to tackle the disadvantages of both the OPV and the IPV. For example, **a novel OPV (nOPV)** has recently been used in African countries.
- **nOPV:** It is manufactured using attenuated polioviruses in which certain mutations have been introduced using genetic engineering, making it five times harder for the virus to regain its neurovirulence.
- **Make IPV manufacturing safer**: Researchers are trying to use attenuated viruses instead of wild viruses.
- **Testing specific adjuvants:** That can be added to the IPV to induce a mucosal immune response.

**Conclusion:** The OPV is a champion that has succeeded in bringing the world to the brink of eradication of a dreaded disease. Until a better effective solution is available, it would be inadvisable to skip the OPV.

### [The Forest (Conservation) Amendment Bill 2023](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/22/the-forest-conservation-amendment-bill-2023/)

####  **G****S Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Environment, Conservation**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/governance/forest-act-amendments-will-help-india-achieve-net-zero-emissions-targets-moefcc-in-joint-committee-report-90748#:~:text=Published%3A%20Thursday%2020%20July%202023,a%20joint%20parliamentary%20committee%20report.)

**Context:** The Forest Conservation (Amendment) Bill 2023 is expected to be tabled for clearance during the monsoon parliament session that began on July 20, 2023.

**The Forest (Conservation) Act 1980:**

- It was enacted to ensure that **India’s forest land is not willingly usurped for non-forestry purposes.**
- The Act empowers the Centre to require that any forest land diverted for non-forestry purposes be **duly compensated.**
- it broadens its purview **to include territory that is not formally designated as “forest”** in State or Central government records.

**Need for the latest amendments:**

- This forest-clearance approval is one of the **most difficult permits to obtain in India**, requiring a wait of as long as 365 days and lakhs of rupees in bribes.
- **India’s land records are in terrible shape**, parcels marked as forests in one official record can be given a different classification in another.
- To make matters worse, **the court order was worded** such that it led states to avoid reclassifying forests.
- According to the Centre, these amendments are necessary **to remove ambiguities and bring clarity about the applicability of the Act on various lands**.

**Some of the proposed amendments:**

- **Cultivating plantations on non-forest land** that could (over time) increase tree cover.
- **Removing the (1980 Act’s) restrictions** on creating infrastructure that would aid national security and create livelihood opportunities for those living on the periphery of forests. **For example,**
    - **In geographically sensitive areas** within 100 km of the International Borders or the Line of Control, no forest clearance is required to construct highways, hydel power projects, etc.
    - No forest clearance is required to establish **zoos, safari parks and ecotourism activities.**
    - **No central protection for vast tracts of so-called ‘deemed forests’** (forests not officially recorded as forests) and permitting activities such as tourism.

**For more features** [**click here:** **Forest Conservation (Amendment) Bill 2023**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/06/forest-conservation-amendment-bill-2023/)

**Concerns raised by the environmentalists:**

- **Amending the name of the Act:** To Van (Sanrakshan Evam Samvardhan) Adhiniyam (translated as Forest Conservation and Augmentation) from the existing Forest (Conservation) Act.
- **The reclassification of forest areas adds confusion:**
    - The Bill states that the FCA will only apply to areas recorded as forests in government records, as on or after **25 October 1980.**
    - This has raised fears that the amendment will **invalidate the SC’s 1996 judgment in T.N. Godavarman vs Union of India,** which expanded the purview of the FCA by interpreting the meaning of forest as its dictionary definition.
    - **If these areas are declassified**, 1,97,159 sq km of forests (**27.****62%** of total 7,13,789 sq km) that lie outside Recorded Forest Areas will lose all protection.
- **Framed without taking real scenario into consideration:**
    - **Only 21%** of India’s land area has forests and **only 12.37%** of this is intact natural forest.
    - While the **India State of Forest Report 2021** has shown a marginal increase (2261 sq. km) in forest cover, **it hides a pattern of deforestation in some parts of the country**.
    - **For instance**, the most biodiversity-rich **north-eastern hill States show** a net decline of 3199 sq. km of forest cover from 2009-2019.
    - Also**,** this marginal increase in forest cover can be ascribed to commercial plantations, which **can’t replace the ecological functions performed by intact natural forests.**
- **Exemptions will remove the necessity of forest clearances:**
    - In border areas, which are home to the most ecologically important ecosystems in the country.
    - **This will be in conflict with the rights of forest-dwelling tribes**, as they will no longer be consulted before seeking forest clearances.
- **The Bill was referred to a joint committee (JPC) instead of the standing committee**: The 31-member joint committee (18 are from the ruling party) has 21 members from the Lok Sabha and 10 from the Rajya Sabha.
    - The JPC has not suggested any changes in the original version of the Bill.

**Government’s intention:**

- **This is a rare opportunity for India to correct a 27-year-old policy logjam** that is holding up growth and employment opportunities, without helping the country substantially conserve its forests.
- **The changes are necessary** considering the dynamic changes in the ecological, strategic and economic aspirations of the country.
- **The amendments will** –
    - Support the country’s objective to increase forest and tree cover up to a third of its land area.
    - Help the country **achieve Net Zero emissions by 2070** and **maintain or enhance forest carbon stocks** through ecologically balanced sustainable development.
    - Help **create a carbon sink** amounting to 2.5-3 billion tonnes of CO2-equivalent by 2030 under the **Nationally Determined Contribution targets.**
- **The scope of this act can be further expanded** with emerging ecological challenges of forest conservation, restoration, compensatory mechanism, mitigation measures, etc.

**Way ahead:**

- The Bill should not be tabled in Parliament **without additional consultations with domain experts**.
- As the devastating impacts of climate change and environmental degradation become clearer (recent floods across north India), **this is the time for the government to reaffirm its commitment** to protecting the country’s immense biodiversity.

**Conclusion:**

- While ensuring the military security of the country is a priority, the Bill should not come at the cost of losing ecological security.
- These natural ecosystems play a crucial role in buffering against increasingly unpredictable weather patterns caused by climate change.

### [Novak Djokovic](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/22/novak-djokovic/)

#### **Content for Mains Enrichment**

Following a **challenging defeat in the 2010 French Open, Novak Djokovic**, a renowned tennis grand slam winner **ranked No. 3 globally**, contemplated **quitting tennis**. Overwhelmed by the **pressures of rankings and external expectations**, he confided in his coach, Marián Vajda.

In response, Vajda posed a crucial question to Djokovic: **Why did he start playing tennis in the first place?**

Reflecting on his early memories, Djokovic realized his love for a **mini tennis racket and soft foam ball,** which ignited his passion for the sport.

Encouraged by Vajda, **Djokovic chose to prioritize the joy of playing over external demands.**

From that moment on, **he embraced the sheer pleasure of playing for its own sake.** The subsequent season **witnessed Djokovic’s remarkable transformation**. He achieved one of the **greatest seasons in sports history, securing 43 consecutive victories**, claiming three Grand Slam titles, including his **first Wimbledon win, and culminating as the world’s top-ranked player.**

By reconnecting with his genuine passion for tennis, Djokovic played with newfound freedom, rediscovering the pure joy of being a carefree kid on the court. This inner connection paved the way for his phenomenal success.

**Learnings from his life**: Balancing Ambition with Enjoyment, Embracing a Playful Mindset, Being True to Yourself, Focusing on Intrinsic Rewards, Authenticity and Self-Awareness and Passion and Love for the thing you are doing.

**Usage**: You can use the story for the essay as well as in the examples of ethics.

 **Context:** The **India Meteorological Department (IMD)** has recently introduced the Heat Index on an **experimental basis**.

- The Heat Index is designed to **offer general guidance for regions in India where the apparent temperature, also known as the “feel-like” temperature**, is higher due to a **combination of heat and humidity**, causing discomfort for people.

The Heat Index is calculated using an **equation similar to the one used by the National Weather Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the USA**. It takes into account the impact of humidity on high temperatures to provide a more accurate representation of how the weather feels to humans, indicating the level of discomfort.

**The Heat Index is categorized into colour codes for easy interpretation:**

- Green: Experimental Heat Index below 35°C
- Yellow: Experimental Heat Index in the range of 36-45°C
- Orange: Experimental Heat Index in the range of 46-55°C
- Red: Experimental Heat Index above 55°C

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/electron-rains-on-mercury-cause-x-ray-auroras-finds-bepicolombo-during-close-flyby-8848269/)

 **Context**: Recent observations by the **BepiColombo mission by ESA and JAXA** provided valuable insights into **auroras on Mercury.**

- On Mercury, **auroras are caused by electrons from solar wind directly interacting with its surface**.
- During the mission’s close Mercury flyby, the spacecraft observed the **planet’s magnetosphere, the region influenced by its magnetic field.** The magnetosphere was found to be **unusually compressed, likely due to the high pressure from the solar wind.**
- The “dawn side” of Mercury’s magnetosphere appeared to **accelerate high-energy electrons that eventually fell onto the planet’s surface**. Since Mercury lacks a substantial atmosphere to hinder their progress, these electrons interact with the surface material, emitting X-ray auroras.

It **confirms that the mechanism generating auroras on Mercury is similar to that found throughout the Solar System**. It sheds light on the process of X-ray auroras on the planet, **a significant step in understanding the interactions between the solar wind and planetary surfaces.**

**What are Auroras?**

Auroras are **natural light displays that occur in the Earth’s polar regions**, mainly near the **Arctic and Antarctic circles**. They are caused by **charged particles from the sun colliding with the Earth’s atmosphere.** The Northern Lights (Aurora Borealis) occur near the North Pole, while the Southern Lights (Aurora Australis) occur near the South Pole.

### [Mutual Funds to introduce five new categories under the ESG Scheme](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/22/mutual-funds-to-introduce-five-new-categories-under-the-esg-scheme/)

**Source:** [**LM**](https://www.livemint.com/mutual-fund/mf-news/mutual-funds-can-launch-five-new-categories-under-esg-scheme-sebi-11689860261053.html)

**Context**: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has permitted mutual funds to introduce **five new categories under the ESG** (environmental, social, and governance) scheme.

- Currently, mutual funds can launch only one ESG scheme under the thematic category of equity schemes.

**What is ESG Scheme?**

ESG aims to **encourage sustainable and ethical business practices**, including climate change, pollution, human rights, corporate governance, and more. SEBI issued a guidance **note in 2012, urging companies listed on Indian Stock Exchanges** to disclose their ESG performance in annual reports.

- With effect from the **financial year 2022-2023, filing of Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR**) has been made mandatory for the **top 1000** listed companies by SEBI.
- ESG schemes are **mandated to invest at least 65% of assets** in listed entities with BRSR Core assurance, while the balance can be invested in companies with BRSR disclosures, starting from October 1, 2024.

**How ESG differs from** [**corporate social responsibility (CSR)**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/10/30/corporate-social-responsibility/#:~:text=What%20is%20Corporate%20Social%20Responsibility,corporation's%20business%20model%20and%20culture.)**?**

- India has a robust CSR policy codified in the Companies Act 2013, mandating that corporations engage in initiatives that contribute to the welfare of society by **spending at least 2% of their net profit over the preceding 3 years on CSR activities.**
-  ESG regulations **differ in process and impact**. For example, The U.K. Modern Slavery Act requires companies to publish the efforts they have taken to identify the risks of child labour in their supply chain, etc.

**Five New Categories of Mutual Funds:**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Categories**|**Description**||
|**Exclusions**|Exclude certain industries or companies based on ESG criteria.|Avoiding investments in fossil fuel companies.|
|**Integration**|Integrating ESG factors into investment decision-making.|Assessing companies’ environmental practices before investing.|
|**Best-in-Class and Positive Screening**|Selecting companies with leading ESG performance in their industry.|Investing in companies with top-notch labour practices.|
|**Impact Investing**|Investing in businesses or projects with positive social and environmental impact.|Funding renewable energy projects.|
|**Sustainable Objectives**|Investing in alignment with specific sustainability goals.|Supporting companies committed to reducing waste.|

**Aim of the New measures**: It aims to facilitate **green financing and requires enhanced disclosures to mitigate greenwashing**.
