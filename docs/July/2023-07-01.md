### [Draft Guidelines for Resource Adequacy Planning Framework for India](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/01/draft-guidelines-for-resource-adequacy-planning-framework-for-india/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Infrastructure (Energy)**

**Source:** [**CEA**](https://cea.nic.in/wp-content/uploads/irp/2022/09/Draft_RA_Guidelines___23_09_2022_final.pdf)

 **Context:** The Ministry of Power, in consultation with the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), has released draft Guidelines for Resource Adequacy Planning Framework for India.

**About the draft guidelines:**

- The guidelines have been formulated under the **Electricity (Amendment) Rules 2022**.
- Under the new framework, the distribution companies (DISCOM) **will create a report detailing**
    - The expected demand,
    - The rate of demand growth,
    - The current contracted capacity, and
    - The amount of power obtained from power exchanges.
- The resource adequacy exercise will be conducted with a **10-year planning horizon** on a continuous basis.
- **The National Load Despatch Center** (NLDC) is required to release an annual short-term national resource adequacy plan covering one year.

**The objective of the plan**:

- **To reliably fulfil the peak demand** with the help of adequate supply of generation and demand response.
- **To optimise the generation of electricity** at the lowest possible cost while meeting the demand. **This includes minimising overall system costs**, such as –
    - Operational and maintenance expenses,
    - Fuel costs,
    - The costs associated with starting up and shutting down power-generating units, etc.
- **To take into account various constraints** related to power plant operations, such as –
    - Limits on ramping up or down generation,
    - Renewable purchase obligation (RPO) targets,
    - Capacities for solar rooftop or distributed generation, etc.

**Significance:**

- A set of guidelines to establish **an institutional mechanism** for resource adequacy, spanning from the national level down to the DISCOM.
- **It will ensure the availability of resources** at each level to meet the demand.
- **It will help proactively assess** the requirements for new generation capacities, energy storage, and other flexible resources well in advance.

**Key challenges:**

- The ongoing challenge of **catering to the peak demand reliably** is being faced by the utilities in India.
- Infrastructural and management challenges while sharing **inter-state and inter-region power**.
- Increasing share of **variable renewable energy and higher frequency of extreme weather events** due to climate change.

 **Way ahead:**

- Given the limited capacity and the learning curve associated with the detailed resource adequacy plan, **DISCOM be allowed a grace period of 2-3 years** before implementation of the same.
- Such a preparatory period would allow the discoms to explore the methodology, collect relevant data and **put an internal institutional mechanism in place.**

### [The Open Market Sale Scheme](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/01/the-open-market-sale-scheme/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Issues of PDS, Buffer Stocks and Food Security**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/explainer-open-market-sale-scheme-supply-to-states-discontinued/article67023932.ece)

 **Context:** The Food Corporation of India (FCI) has imposed quantity restrictions on states to procure **two food grains (wheat and rice)** through its Open Market Sale Scheme (OMSS).

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**The issue related to the OMSS**|   |
|**About OMSS**|Under the OMSS, the **FCI sells (from time to time) surplus food grains (especially wheat and rice) from the central pool in the open market to traders,** bulk consumers, and retail chains, at pre-determined prices.|
|**How?**|Through **e-­auctions**, where open-market bidders can buy specified quantities.|
|**OMSS and States**|States are also allowed to procure food grains (over and above what they get from the central pool to distribute to NFSA beneficiaries) through the OMSS **without participating in the auctions**.|
|**Objective of OMSS**|**Ensure food security** by enhancing the supply of food grains during the lean season, **control inflation** by moderating the open market prices, especially in the deficit regions|
|**Revision of OMSS**|The Centre decided to restrict the quantity that a single bidder can purchase from 3,000 metric tonnes (MT) to 10­-100 MT.|
|**The objective behind the revision**|**To accommodate more small and marginal buyers, curb retail prices as allowing smaller bids should ideally break monopolies of bulk buyers, allowing more competitive bids by small buyers.**|
|**Impact of Revision on States**|The Centre stopped the sale of rice and wheat from the Central pool under the OMSS to State governments, also disallowing private bidders to sell their OMSS supplies to state governments.|
|**Steps Taken by States**|Considering **alternative methods** of obtaining wheat and rice. **For example,** TN is trying to purchase rice from government agencies other than FCI.|
|**Allegations of States**|States such as Karnataka (which runs the Anna Bhagya scheme) and Tamil Nadu (which runs the universal PDS) have criticised the government for engaging in “politics” at the expense of marginalised beneficiaries of State welfare schemes.|
|**Centre’s reply**|**Restrictions are imposed to curb inflation and regulate supply. The Centre is already distributing grains to 80 crore marginalised beneficiaries under the NFSA.**|

**FCI:**

- It is a **statutory** body set up setup under the **Food Corporation Act 1964**, in order to fulfil the following objectives of the Food Policy:
    - **Effective price support operations** for safeguarding the interests of the farmers.
    - **Distribution of food grains** throughout the country for a PDS.
    - **Maintaining a satisfactory level of operational and buffer stocks** of foodgrains to ensure National Food Security.
- It comes under the **Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution**, Government of India.
- Since its inception, FCI has contributed significantly to India’s success in transforming its food security system from one that was focused on crisis management to one that is stable.

 **Context:** Scientists have **found evidence suggesting the presence of a continuous background of gravitational waves** in the universe.

**About Gravitational Waves:**

- Gravitational waves are **disturbances in the fabric of spacetime** caused by the **movement of large objects, such as the collision of two black holes**.
- The waves were first **detected in 2015**, but this new research indicates that **multiple gravitational waves constantly deform and reshape spacetime**, influencing the motion of celestial bodies.

**Findings:**

Scientists have **discovered a ‘background hum’ rumbling throughout the universe**. It confirms the **presence of low-frequency (long-wavelengths) gravitational waves**, thought to be constantly rolling through space noise.

India’s **Giant Metre wave Radio Telescope (GMRT, Pune**) was among the world’s six large telescopes that played a vital role in providing evidence. **The other 5 are located in Germany, the UK, France, Italy and the Netherlands.**
