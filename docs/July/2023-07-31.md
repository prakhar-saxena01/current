### [All India Tiger Estimation 2022](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/31/all-india-tiger-estimation-2022/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Environment and Conservation**

 **Source:** [**PIB**](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1943922)

 **Context:** On the occasion of Global Tiger Day (July 29), a detailed report on the All-India Tiger Estimation 2022 was released.

**Highlights of the report:**

- According to the Wildlife Institute of India’s (WII) 5th quadrennial tiger census, **India’s tiger population increased to 3,682 in 2022**.
- The numbers in the report, revised from 3167 earlier, **reflect a commendable annual growth rate of 6.1% per annum.**
- **The largest tiger population of 785 is in MP**, followed by Karnataka (563) and Uttarakhand (560), and Maharashtra (444).
- **The tiger abundance within the Tiger Reserve is highest in Corbett (260),** followed by Bandipur (150), Nagarhole (141), Bandhavgarh (135), Dudhwa (135)**,**
- **Central India and the Shivalik Hills and Gangetic Plains** witnessed a notable increase in tiger population, **while the Western Ghats experienced localised declines**, necessitating targeted monitoring and conservation efforts.
- Some states, including **Mizoram, Nagaland, Jharkhand, Goa, Chhattisgarh and Arunachal Pradesh**, have reported disturbing trends with small tiger populations.

**Efforts to conserve the species:**

- **Global Tiger Day (July 29):** It was instituted in **2010** at the **Tiger Summit** in St Petersburg, Russia when the 13 tiger range countries came together to create **Tx2** – the global goal to double the number of wild tigers by the year 2022.
- **Project Tiger of India:**
    - It was launched by the Central government on **April 1, 1973**, at the Jim Corbett National Park of Uttarakhand to promote the conservation of the tiger.
    - It didn’t just focus on the conservation of the big cats but also **ensured the preservation of their natural habitat as tigers are at the top of the food chain.**
- **National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) of India:** It was established in 2005, following a recommendation of the Tiger Task Force, to reorganise the management of Project Tiger and India’s many Tiger Reserves in India.
- **Management Effectiveness Evaluation (MEE):**
    - It was adopted from the framework of the IUCN World Commission on Protected Areas.
    - Since its inception in **2006**, MEE has been jointly conducted by the NTCA and the WII and has paved the path for a successful evaluation of national tiger conservation efforts in India.

**The success story of India’s conservation efforts:**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tiger_population.png)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tiger_population.png)

- Today, there are 54 tiger reserves across India, spanning 75,000 sq km.
- Nearly 75% of the global tiger population (in the wild) can today be found in India.

**Challenges for the world and India:**

- **Overall**, the designated year (2022) for achieving the goals of Tx2 saw uneven progress. **For example**, the countries in Southeast Asia struggled to control population decline.
- **For India,**
    - The tiger population of the country **cannot be increased at the same pace** because that will result in an increase in conflict with human beings.
    - **Action on key agendas** like carbon capture and climate change, fund flow as well as village relocation **has been the weakest performing area for Indian tiger reserves**.

**Way ahead:**

- **There is a need to strongly continue the eco-friendly development agenda**, minimise mining impacts, and rehabilitate mining sites.
- Vital steps to protect the country’s tiger populations include –
    - Fortifying protected area management,
    - Intensifying anti-poaching measures,
    - Employing scientific thinking and technology-driven data collection, and
    - Addressing human-wildlife conflict.

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**CNBC**](https://www.cnbctv18.com/economy/pm-narendra-modi-rajasthan-launch-what-is-urea-gold-17350961.htm)

 **Context:** Urea Gold is **a new variety of urea coated with sulphur**, launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Rajasthan’s Sikar.

**Aim**: It is designed to **address sulphur deficiencies in the soil,** benefiting farmers by enhancing agricultural productivity.

**Urea Gold is said to be better than conventional forms of Urea (including Neem coated urea)**

- **Slow release**: Sulphur-coated urea facilitates a **gradual release of nitrogen**, thereby enhancing its availability and uptake by crops.
- **Extended Life**: The inclusion of humic acid in Urea Gold further extends its lifespan as a fertilizer.
- **Reduces overall fertilizer usage**: According to the report, **15 kg of Urea Gold** provides comparable benefits to **20 kg of conventional urea**, making it a more efficient and effective choice for farmers.

**About Urea:**

The main function of Urea fertilizer (40% of Nitrogen content) is to provide the plants with **nitrogen to promote green leafy growth. It** also **aids the photosynthesis process of plants**. Since urea fertilizer can **provide only nitrogen and not phosphorus or potassium**, it’s primarily **used for bloom growth**.

**Source:** [**Weather**](https://weather.com/en-IN/india/science/news/2023-07-26-ureilite-meteorite-created-dhala-impact-crater-in-madhya-pradesh)

 **Context:** A recent study suggests that **Madhya Pradesh’s famous Dhala impact crater** was created by an extraordinarily rare and ancient meteorite known as **Ureilite**.

**About the meteorite:**

Meteorites are **extra-terrestrial rocks or metallic objects that survive** their journey through **Earth’s atmosphere and land** on the planet’s surface. They originate from **asteroids, comets, or other celestial bodies in space**.

**What are Ureilites?**

These are a **rare class of primitive meteorites** that consist of **silicate rock with olivine and pyroxene**, along with **less than 10% of carbon, metal sulphides**, and fine-grained silicates.

The Ureilite that created the Dhala crater was approximately one kilometre in diameter and crashed into Earth’s atmosphere at an extraordinary speed of 15 km/s about 2500 to 1700 million years ago.

**Significance**: With this discovery, **scientists hope to uncover more secrets about the rare meteorite crater** and its potential role in **Earth’s early history**, including its impact on **bringing water to the planet** and the development of life.

- The Dhala crater is **Asia’s largest and the world’s seventh-largest impact crater.**

**In India, three meteor impact craters are found:**

- Ramgarh in Rajasthan
- Lonar in Maharashtra
- Dhala in MP
