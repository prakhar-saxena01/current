#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Important Aspects of Governance, Transparency and Accountability**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/jan-vishwas-amendment-bill-2023-monsoon-session-parliament-bill-explains/article67095334.ece)

**Context:** The Jan Vishwas (Amendment of Provisions) Bill 2023 is set to be taken up during the ongoing Monsoon Session of the Parliament.

**Objective of the Bill:**

- To redefine the regulatory landscape of the country with decriminalisation of minor offences under 42 Acts.
- To reduce compliance burden and promote ease of living and doing business in the country.

**More about the Bill:**

- The Bill was tabled in Parliament by the Union Ministry of Commerce and Industry (December 2022) and then referred to a Joint Parliamentary Committee.
- As per reports, most recommendations of the JPC have been approved by the Union Cabinet, clearing the way for its passing.

**Salient provisions of the Bill:**

- **Decriminalising:** 180 offences across 42 laws governing environment, agriculture, media, industry and trade, etc.
- **Completely remove/ replace imprisonment clauses:** With monetary fines.
- Compounding of offences in some provisions.
- Removes all offences and penalties under the Indian Post Office Act, 1898.
- **Changes in grievance redressal mechanisms**: Appointment of one or more Adjudicating Officers for determining penalties.
- **A periodic revision of fines and penalties:** An increase of 10% of the minimum amount every 3 years for various offences in the specified Acts.

**Some key laws covered in the Bill:**

- The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981
- The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986
- The Indian Forest Act, 1927
- The Agricultural Produce (Grading & Marking) Act, 1937
- The Information Technology Act, 2000
- The Copyright Act, 1957
- The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988
- The Cinematograph Act, 1952
- The Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, etc

**Need for the Bill:**

- **A large number of compliances govern doing business in India:**
    - Currently, there are 1,536 laws which translate into around **70,000 compliances** that govern doing business in India.
    - Among these, **26,134 have imprisonment clauses** as a penalty for non-compliance.
- **Lengthy processing times for the needed approvals:** Escalating costs and dampening the entrepreneurial spirit.
- **Implications:**
    - Excessive compliances have proved burdensome for business enterprises, especially **MSMEs**.
    - **Creating barriers** to the smooth flow of ideas and the creation of jobs, wealth and GDP.

**Significance of the Bill:**

- Reducing the compliance burden gives **impetus to the business ecosystem and improves the well-being of the public.**
- Smoother processes will attract more investment.
- **It will reduce judicial burden,** as settlement by compounding method, adjudication and administrative mechanism will save time, energy and resources.
- In short, the Bill seeks to bolster **‘trust-based governance’** – promoting ease of doing business and ease of living.

**Concerns:**

- **Quasi-decriminalisation:** The monetary fines or penalties are not a good enough attempt at decriminalisation.
- **Remove the deterrence effect of the environmental legislation:** The blanket removal of imprisonment provision might remove deterrence, especially for large corporations profiteering from the offence.
- **Adjudicating Officers may lack the technical competence:** Necessary to decide all penalties under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1981 and the Environment (Protection) Act 1986.
- **Many offences** (like theft or misappropriation of postal articles) proposed to be removed have nothing to do with its objective of decriminalisation to promote ease of doing business**.**

**Conclusion:**

- The cornerstone of **democratic governance** lies in the government trusting its own people and institutions and **a web of outdated rules and regulations causes trust deficit**.
- After resolving the above issues, **the Jan Vishwas Bill will help to clear the burdensome collection of old and outdated legislation.**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/cinematograph-amendment-bill-2023-passed-in-rajya-sabha-new-provisions-on-piracy-certifying-of-movies-8864136/#:~:text=Rajya%20Sabha%20on%20Thursday%20(July,those%20making%20its%20pirated%20copies.)

**Context:** Rajya Sabha passed the Cinematograph (Amendment) Bill 2023, which cracks down on film piracy along with changing how movies are certified by the censor board.

**The background:**

- **The Cinematograph (Amendment) Bill 2019** was introduced in the Rajya Sabha proposing changes **related only to film piracy**.
- This Bill was referred to the Standing Committee on Information Technology, whose recommendations included **age-based categories of certification.**
- The revised Cinematograph (Amendment) Bill 2021 and the final version (2023 Bill) were drafted after consultations with industry stakeholders and the public.

**About the 2023 Bill:**

- Introduced by the Ministry of I&B, the Bill seeks to amend **the Cinematograph Act 1952.**
- **The 1952 Act authorises the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC)** to require cuts in films and clear them for exhibition in cinemas and on television/ refuse the exhibition of a film.

**Why does the Cinematograph Act 1952 need amendments?**

- **To harmonise the law** with various executive orders, SC judgements, and other legislations like the Copyright Act, 1957 and the IT Act (IT) 2000.
- **To improve the procedure** for licensing films for public exhibition by the CBFC, and
- **To expand the scope** of categorisations for certification.
- **To curb the menace of piracy,** there was a huge demand from the film industry to address the issue of unauthorised recording and exhibition of films, which is causing them huge losses (Rs 20,000 crore annually).

|**Salient features**|**The Cinematograph Act 1952**|**The Cinematograph (Amendment) Bill 2023**|
|**Additional certificate categories**|Under the Act, film may be certified for exhibition: without restriction (‘U’); without restriction, but subject to guidance of parents or guardians for children below 12 years of age (‘UA’); only to adults (‘A’), or only to members of any profession or class of persons (‘S’).|The Bill adds certain additional certificate categories based on age. It **substitutes the UA category** with the following three categories to also indicate **age-appropriateness**: UA 7+, UA 13+ or UA 16+.<br><br>This is in line with the Shyam Benegal committee’s (2017) recommendations.|
|**Separate certificate for television/other media**||Films with an ‘A’ or ‘S’ certificate will require a separate certificate for exhibition on television, or any other media prescribed by the central government.<br><br>The Board may direct the applicant to carry appropriate deletions or modifications for the separate certificate.|
|**Unauthorised recording and exhibition to be punishable**|**Provides for certain exemptions –** use of copyrighted content without owner’s authorisation in case of reporting of current affairs, etc.|**In order to stop piracy,** the Bill prohibits carrying out or abetting the unauthorised recording and unauthorised exhibition of films**.**<br><br>Exemptions under the **Copyright Act 1957 will also apply to the above offences.**<br><br>**The above offences will be punishable with:** imprisonment between 3 months and 3 years, and a fine between 3 lakh rupees and 5% of the audited gross production cost.|
|**Validity of certificates**|For 10 years|Perpetually/always valid|
|**Revisional powers of the central government**|Empowers the central government to examine and make orders in relation to films that have been certified or are pending certification.  The Board is required to dispose of matters in conformance with the order.|Removes this power of the central government.|

**Significance of the Bill:**

- It will make the certification process **more effective**, in tune with the present times.
- By comprehensively curbing the menace of film piracy, **it will help in faster growth of the film industry and boost job creation in the sector.**

**Concerns:**

- **OTT platforms out of the purview of the Bill:** What if an uncut movie is broadcast on OTT?
- **Age-appropriate categories are self-regulatory:** It places the onus on parents and guardians to determine if the material is appropriate for viewers of a particular age range.

 **Context:** The Offshore Areas Mineral (Development and Regulation) Amendment Bill 2023 to amend the offshore areas mineral law was introduced in Lok Sabha.

**About the bill:**

The bill, prepared by the **Ministry of Mines**, seeks to amend the Offshore Areas Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act **2002**, to allow auction of minerals mined offshore.

**Purpose behind amending the 2002 Act:**

- **To mine rocks under the sea:** Under the original Act, not even a single rock could be not mined out from the sea bed mainly due to pending litigations.
    - Hence, the Bill allows the use of the national wealth in the sea for the use of the people of the country.
- **To provide an auction of minerals mined offshore:** The original Act does not allow the auction of such minerals.
- **To facilitate private sector participation:** In the mining of non-atomic minerals in India’s territorial waters and continental shelf.
    - Meanwhile, the bill includes a provision to grant mineral concession without competitive bidding to Government companies or corporations.
    - However, private companies might be encouraged **to contribute cutting-edge technologies for the execution of complex mining operations**.
- **To improve transparency in the allocation of mineral resources**: With a provision for granting production leases only through auction, Mint reported.
- **To grant an exploration licence or production lease:** Only to a government company in case the quality of minerals in that particular area is equal to or above the threshold value decided by the Centre.
- **To propose area under a production lease:** Such areas shall comprise contiguous standard blocks and shall not exceed an area of 15 minutes latitude by 15 minutes longitude.
- **To promote ease of doing business**: A provision has been made for easy transfer of exploration licence, composite licence or production lease.
- **To remove discretion in the grant of renewals**: The provisions for renewal of production leases have been removed and the period of production lease has been increased to 50 years.
- **To grant powers to the central government:** To revise the order made by the Administering Authority, issue directions and call for information from the Administering Authority, in the public interest.

**What India gains from this Bill?**

- As India aims to become a high-growth economy, it needs to harness its maritime resources to its optimal capacity.
- The bill encourages the participation of the **public-private sector.**
- **The private sector** will bring the necessary expertise and technology to explore and mine the mineral resources present in the EEZ.

**Context:** The Jharkhand government has released draft rules for public consultation to implement **The Provisions of the** [**Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act (PESA) enacted in 1996**.](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/functions-and-responsibilities-of-the-union-and-the-states-issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure-devolution-of-powers-and-finances-up-to-local-levels-and-challenges-therein/devolution-of-powers-and-finances-up-to-local-levels-and-challenges-therein/73rd-amendment-act-panchayati-raj/pesa-act-1996/#:~:text=Panchayats%20(Extension%20to%20Scheduled%20Areas,Scheduled%20Areas%20of%20the%20country.)

- In Jharkhand, Scheduled Areas are identified by the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution, covering 13 out of 24 districts in the state.

The draft rules **grant gram sabhas in Scheduled Areas certain rights**, such as **resolving traditional and family disputes**, hearing specific cases under the Indian Penal Code (IPC), and maintaining peace and order in accordance with the principles of the Constitution.

**About** [**PESA Act**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/functions-and-responsibilities-of-the-union-and-the-states-issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure-devolution-of-powers-and-finances-up-to-local-levels-and-challenges-therein/devolution-of-powers-and-finances-up-to-local-levels-and-challenges-therein/73rd-amendment-act-panchayati-raj/pesa-act-1996/#:~:text=Panchayats%20(Extension%20to%20Scheduled%20Areas,Scheduled%20Areas%20of%20the%20country.)**:**

- The PESA Act was enacted in 1996 **“to provide for the extension of the provisions of Part IX of the Constitution relating to the Panchayats to the Scheduled Areas”.**
- Part IX, **comprising Articles 243-243ZT of the Constitution**, contains provisions relating to municipalities and cooperative societies.

Under the Act, Scheduled Areas are those **referred to in Article 244(1),** which says that the provisions of the Fifth Schedule shall apply to the **Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes in states other than Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.**

The Fifth Schedule provides for **a range of special provisions for these areas.**

Ten states — Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Rajasthan, and Telangana — **have notified Fifth Schedule areas that cover (partially or fully) several districts in each of these states.**

**Purpose:**

Self-governance recognises the right of tribal communities and empowers Gram Sabha.

 India has introduced a [**Cooling Action Plan (ICAP)**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/03/10/india-cooling-action-plan-icap/#:~:text=The%20goals%20emerging%20from%20the,%25%20by%20year%202037%2D38.) that aims to achieve a **20% reduction in cooling load** through climate-appropriate **building envelopes and a 30% reduction** in cooling energy through improved efficiency and practices.

The key to **providing thermal comfort lies in recognizing** the appropriate cooling technologies for different climatic conditions.

**Examples include:**

- Ceiling fans for heat dispersal
- Desert coolers for hot and dry months
- Ventilation and dehumidification for humid climates

**Innovative Cooling solutions include:**

- Using the Earth’s potential as a heat sink through tunnels embedded underground
- Evaporative cooling by passing air through water-saturated mediums
- Indirect evaporative cooling cools incoming air without adding moisture
- Dehumidification for extremely humid weather conditions.

 **Context:** Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the **international exhibition-cum-convention Centre (IECC) complex** named **Bharat Mandapam** at Pragati Maidan in New Delhi.

- The IECC complex is India’s largest **MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences, and exhibitions) destination** and features **state-of-the-art facilities**, including a **convention centre, exhibition halls, and an amphitheatre.**

The **architectural design of the convention centre incorporates elements from India’s traditional art and culture**, representing the **nation’s rich heritage and modern achievements**.

The term **‘Bharat Mandapam’ is derived from** [**Lord Basaveshwara’s**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/24/basavanna-2/) **concept of ‘Anubhav Mantapa,’** which was a significant institution in the 12th century. Anubhav Mantapa is considered one of the **earliest parliaments in human history**, where poets and socio-spiritual reformers known as **Sharanas** discussed and deliberated on various reforms.

**In this historical context:**

- **Prabhudeva**, a renowned Yogi, served as the President, while Lord Basaveshwara acted as the Prime Minister.
- The members of the Anubhav Mantapa were **not elected by the people**; instead, they were chosen or nominated by the higher authorities of the Mantapa.

- The government’s response to the Parliamentary committee’s earlier recommendations explained that data on PwDs is primarily **derived from decennial censuses and sample surveys on disability**.
- The government also introduced **Unique Disability ID (UDID) cards** for individuals covered under **disability schemes**, but the committee found this approach insufficient, **as the number of issued UDID cards did not match the estimated PwD population.**

**Recommendation:**

The committee emphasized the **need for innovative solutions and recommended that the government collaborate with State governments and other departments/organizations** involved in PwD welfare schemes to arrive at a realistic assessment of the PwD population in the country.

### [India’s Rice Export Ban](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/28/indias-rice-export-ban/)

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/business/imf-indias-rice-export-curbs-could-spur-food-price-inflation/article67120785.ece#:~:text=India's%20move%20to%20restrict%20exports,Olivier%20Gourinchas%20said%20on%20Tuesday.)

 **Context:** IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas stated that India’s decision to restrict exports of certain types of rice could contribute to food price inflation and should be reversed.

Previously, **India has implemented** [**restrictions on non-basmati white rice exports**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/08/agricultural-exports-imports/) to ensure **sufficient availability in the domestic market** at reasonable prices. The export ban is also intended to support the **ethanol-blending program**, reduce costly oil imports, and benefit the animal husbandry and poultry sectors by **lowering animal feed costs**.

**India’s status in rice exports:**

India is the **second-largest producer of rice** in the world, after China. India has become the **largest rice exporter globally,** accounting for **nearly 40% of global rice exports in 2022/23**. Non-basmati white rice constitutes **approximately 25% of** the total rice exported from the country.

**Impact of the ban**:

- IMF predicts a potential **rise of 10-15% this year** in international rice prices.
- **Countries in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa,** which heavily rely on India as a major supplier of rice, may face vulnerability due to potential disruptions in the rice market.
