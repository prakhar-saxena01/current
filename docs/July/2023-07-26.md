### [The DNA Technology (Use and Application) Regulation Bill 2019](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/26/the-dna-technology-use-and-application-regulation-bill-2019/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Government policies and interventions for development in various sectors and issues arising out of their design and implementation**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/what-is-the-dna-bill-8857810/#:~:text=What%20are%20the%20objections%20against%20the%20Bill%3F,of%20the%20individual%20is%20protected.)

 **Context:** The Union government withdrew the DNA Technology (Use and Application) Regulation Bill 2019 from the Lok Sabha.

**What is DNA technology?**

- **DNA/Deoxyribonucleic acid is the genetic material** of the cell and contains all of the instructions for cells to carry out their structure and function.
- DNA technology is the **study and manipulation of genetic material,** which includes sequencing, analysis, and cutting-and-pasting of DNA.
- Using this technology, **scientists are able to manipulate DNA** to study the biology of living organisms and to improve human life (treatment of diseases).
- However, the technology can be abused through **unauthorised access to databanks and unauthorised disclosure of information.**

**Background of the Bill:**

- **First proposed in 2003** (by the Ministry of S&T), the Bill has gone through numerous changes, led by both the Department of Biotechnology and the Law Ministry, over the years.
- **In 2019**, it was referred to the **Parliamentary Standing Committee** on S&T after being introduced in the Lok Sabha.
- **In 2021**, the panel’s report was released, which highlighted that **the Bill could be misused to target segments of society** based on religion, caste or political views.

**About the DNA Technology (Use and Application) Regulation Bill:**

- **It seeks to create a regulatory framework** for obtaining, storing and testing DNA samples of human beings –
    - **Mainly for the purposes of criminal investigations**, and
    - With the objective of establishing the identity of a person.
- **The proposed law seeks to bring in a supervisory structure** –
    - To oversee practices (already used in criminal investigations, establishment of parentage, and search for missing people), and
    - Frame guidelines and rules so that the DNA technology is not misused.
- It also specifies –
    - The **circumstances under which a person can be asked to submit DNA samples**,
    - The purposes for which such requests can be made, and
    - The exact procedure for handling, storing and accessing these samples.

**The Bill proposes to set up institutional structures:**

- **At the national level,**
    - **DNA regulatory board:** The board is proposed to be the main regulatory authority and would frame the rules and guidelines for DNA collection, testing and storage.
    - **DNA data bank:** It would be the repository of all DNA samples collected from various people under specified rules.
- **Regional centres** of the board as well as the data bank can be set up at the state level too.

**Powers of the DNA regulatory board:** The testing of DNA samples can be carried out only at laboratories that are authorised to do so by the regulatory board.

**Objections against the Bill:**

- **Three issues** – whether DNA technology is foolproof, whether the provisions adequately address the possibility of abuse of DNA information, and whether the privacy of the individual is protected.
- **DNA information can be extremely revelatory** and collecting and storing such intrusive information could lead to **abuse and violation of a person’s privacy**.

**The government’s argument:**

- **Nearly 60 countries have enacted similar legislation** and all important matters related to privacy, confidentiality and data protection have been taken into account.
- **Very limited information is proposed to be stored** in the indices, which can tell nothing about the individual and only act as a unique identifier.

**Why is Bill withdrawn?**

As per reports, most of the provisions of the Bill were broadly covered in the [Criminal Procedure (Identification) Act 2022](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/05/05/sansad-tv-perspective-the-criminal-procedure-identification-bill-2022-unmasking-criminals/) brought by the Ministry of Home Affairs.

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Mechanisms, Laws, Institutions and Bodies constituted for the Protection and Betterment of these Vulnerable Sections**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/manipur-naked-parade-video-manipur-violence-ncw-dcw-women-commissions-in-india-8858184/)

 **Context:** The cases of molestation and rape of women in Manipur have brought the functioning of Women’s commissions in India into focus.

**National Commission for Women (NCW):**

- It is a **statutory body o**f the Government of India that was founded on **January 31, 1992**, by **the National Commission for Women Act, 1990.**
- **Its mandate is to:**
    - Review the Constitutional and Legal safeguards for women;
    - Recommend remedial legislative measures;
    - Facilitate redressal of grievances and
    - Advise the Government on all policy matters affecting women.
- **Functions:**
    - Investigate and examine all issues concerning the protection provided to women under the Constitution and other legislation.
    - Report on the effectiveness of those safeguards to the Central Government.
    - Make recommendations in such reports for the effective application of those protections.
    - Propose corrective legislative actions to address any flaws in laws.
    - Investigate complaints and **take suo moto action** in cases involving the denial of women’s rights.

**The Manipur State Commission for Women (MSCW):**

- **Each state also has its own commission** and MSCW was constituted in **2006** as a statutory body under the Manipur State Commission for Women Act, 2006.
- **It is mandated to safeguard the interests of women** with a wide mandate that covers all aspects of women’s development.

**Major Issues around the Working of Women Commission:**

- **Financial assistance** provided to the Commissions is extremely less to cater to its needs.
- **Their members are appointed by the government** and therefore lack the independence to work without the influence of the government.
- **They lack concrete legislative power**. **For example,** its reports are only recommendatory.

**Implications of the above:**

- These commissions at the national and state levels have become **toothless tigers**, failing to prioritise field visits over paperwork.
- Most of the commissions are **afraid to criticise the governments.**

**Case of Manipur:**

- **The NCW had received a large number of complaints** about the violation of women’s rights in the state.
- **The NCW forwarded them to the state**. The state police or its other wings probably ignored the forwards or did not have time to do justice to each of them.

**Way ahead:**

- **Commissions need to be strengthened** (either by giving them Constitutional status or by amending their parent laws) so that they can concentrate on providing physical, emotional, legal and psychological aid to women in distress.
- **Advertising the posts of chairpersons and members of these commissions**.
- Genuinely interested and capable individuals would then be selected by a **selection committee –** consisting of LoP, judges from the SC, civil society organisations, etc.
- **A social audit of the performance** of different commissions by competent external agencies on a regular basis would give citizens an idea of their actual work.
- **There is a need for an increase of awareness and enlightenment** especially required mainly among women in rural areas that such a commission exists to address their rights.

**Conclusion:** Women’s commissions in India were set up with a lot of high expectations. However, a review of their work and responses to the issues of women is the immediate need of the hour to prevent incidents like Manipur.

### [Issues faced by gig workers in India](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/26/issues-faced-by-gig-workers-in-india/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Indian Economy and related issues**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/panel-asks-labour-ministry-to-implement-welfare-schemes-for-gig-workers-8857900/)

 **Context:** A parliamentary panel has asked the Ministry of Labour and Employment (MoL&E) to formulate and implement welfare schemes for gig and platform workers and unorganised sector workers at the earliest.

**Why?**

Since such workers do not come under the purview of the Employees’ Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, appropriate/ specific welfare schemes for them need to be put in place by the government.

**What is a gig economy?**

- **It is a labour market** that relies heavily on temporary and part-time positions filled by independent contractors and freelancers rather than full-time permanent employees.
- **Gig workers gain flexibility and independence but little or no job security.**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Gig workers**|   |
|Gig workers refer to workers outside of the traditional employer-employee relationship. There are two groups of gig workers.|   |
|**Platform workers**|**Non-platform workers**|
|When gig workers use online algorithmic matching platforms or apps to connect with customers, they are called platform workers.|Those who work outside of these platforms are non-platform workers, including construction workers and non-technology-based temporary workers.|

**Gig economy in India:** According to the NITI Aayog estimates, **nearly 23.5 million workers** will be engaged in the gig economy by **2029**.

**Issues faced by gig workers:**

- Since the gig economy **falls outside the scope of traditional, full-time employment**, gig workers usually **lack basic employment rights** such as
    - Minimum wages,
    - Overtime pay,
    - Medical leave, and
    - A statutorily bound resolution of employer-employee disputes.
- Gig workers display **characteristics of both employees and independent contractors** → as a result fall outside the ambit of statutory benefits under –
    - the Minimum Wages Act 1948, EPF Act 1952 and the Payment of Bonus Act 196 (for **employees**)
    - the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act 1970 (for **contract labourers**)

**What is the proposed law for gig workers?**

- **The Code on Social Security 2020**, which has proposed social security schemes for gig workers and platform workers on matters relating to –
    - life and disability cover,
    - accident insurance,
    - health and maternity benefits,
    - old age protection, etc.
- However, the Code is yet to come into force.

**Other efforts:**

**A MoU** has been signed between the MoL&E and the NLSIU (Bangalore) **for assistance in framing a new scheme** for the gig and platform workers as well as workers in the unorganised sector.

**Concerns:**

- Out of the four new labour codes proposed, **gig work finds reference only in the Code on Social Security**.
    - Hence, they **cannot create legally recognised unions and access a national minimum wage** that applies to all forms of employment.
    - They also remain **excluded from accessing the specialised redressal mechanism** against their employers.
- Gig workers are excluded from the category of ‘unorganised workers’ or ‘wage workers’.
- They also do not have the **right to collective bargaining** – a fundamental principle of modern labour law.
- All the above leads to the violation of their fundamental rights under **Articles 14 and 21** and comes within the meaning of **forced labour under Article 23.**

**Best practices:**

- **The Rajasthan Platform-Based Gig Workers (Registration and Welfare) Act 2023:** Rajasthan has become the first state in the country to pass a law for the welfare of lakhs of gig workers earning their livelihood through online platforms (Ola, Swiggy, etc).
- **Germany’s** Temporary Employment Act provides for equal pay and equal treatment of gig workers.
- **Singapore** has also proposed legislative changes to extend work injury insurance and pension coverage to such workers.

**Conclusion:** A specific scheme for such workers, as recommended by the Standing Committee on Labour, Textiles, and Skill Development may resolve the above concerns.

### [India’s ethanol push](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/26/indias-ethanol-push/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/the-ethanol-impetus-8856449/lite/)

**Context:** At a G20 Energy Ministers’ meeting, the Indian PM stated that India **has rolled out 20% ethanol-blended petrol this year** and aims to cover the entire **country by 2025.**

**Ethanol:**

- Ethanol is basically **9%** pure alcohol that can be blended with petrol.
- It is different from the 94% rectified spirit (having applications in paints, and pharmaceuticals) and 96% extra neutral alcohol that goes to make potable liquor.

**India’s ethanol production programme:** It has come a long way in the past five years, both in terms of the quantities supplied by sugar mills/distilleries to oil marketing companies (OMCs) and the raw material used.

**Raw material used:** 

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ethanol.jpg?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ethanol.jpg)

**What does it mean?**

- **India’s ethanol programme is no longer reliant on a single feedstock or crop**.
- It has diversified only from molasses and cane to rice, maize and other grains as well.

**Implications of diversification of feedstocks:**

- It will **minimise supply fluctuations and price volatility** on account of any one crop.
- The incorporation of new feedstocks **can create new demand for grains**.
    - **For example,** if UP (a major sugarcane grower) and Bihar (maize) could supply rice, barley and millets to distilleries, they can “fuel India” the way Punjab, Haryana or MP “feed India”.

**How was this diversification made possible?**

- **Differential pricing:**
    - Till 2017-18, the OMCs were paying a uniform price for ethanol produced from any feedstocks.
    - From 2018-19, the government began fixing higher prices for ethanol produced from B-heavy molasses and whole sugarcane juice/syrup.
    - **This gave flexibility and incentive** for mills/distilleries to use multiple feedstocks.
    - **This has given stimulus** **to ethanol production,** which can be seen from its all-India average blending with petrol touching 75% in 2022-23, as against 1.6% in 2013-14.
- **Byproduct benefits:**
    - The liquid effluent (spent wash) generated during alcohol production in distilleries can pose **serious environmental problems** if discharged without proper treatment.
    - The new molasses-based distilleries have MEE (multi-effect evaporator) units, where the spent wash is concentrated to about 60% solids.
    - The concentrated wash is used as **a boiler fuel along with bagasse** (the fibre remaining after crushing sugarcane).

**While the ethanol program has numerous benefits, there are also some concerns**. Increased demand for grains for ethanol production may impact food supply and prices. Additionally, distilleries’ liquid effluent can pose environmental challenges, but advancements such as multi-effect evaporator units have enabled the utilization of spent wash as boiler fuel and the production of fertilizer and animal feed as by-products.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, the ethanol program holds promise for reducing dependence on fossil fuels, promoting sustainable practices, and providing opportunities for farmers and industries.

####  **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Environment and Conservation**

**Source:** [**FAO**](https://www.fao.org/3/cc2274en/cc2274en.pdf)

 **Context:** At a time when the world is reeling under challenges like hunger, COVID-19, ecosystem degradation and inequalities, the presentation of the FAO Strategy on Climate Change 2022-2031 is timely.

**How?**

The Strategy rests on the **vision of climate-resilient agriculture to transform agri-food systems** to be more efficient, inclusive, resilient and sustainable.

**[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/today.png)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/today.png)**

**Why?**

Sustainable and resilient agrifood systems provide a variety of solutions that respond to climate crisis challenges and contribute to restoring degraded natural and managed ecosystems.

**FAO Strategy on Climate Change 2022-2031:**

- Endorsed by the FAO Council, this Strategy is **a response to the worldwide challenge of tackling the impacts of the climate crisis.**
- **It aims to address** a broad range of interlinked challenges, including –
    - biodiversity loss,
    - desertification,
    - land and environmental degradation,
    - the need for accessible, affordable renewable energy, and
    - food and water security.

**Implications:** It will help countries implement their country-driven commitments and plans, including –

- Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and
- National Adaptation Plans (NAPs)
- 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development

**Conclusion:** The new Strategy looks beyond only food production by considering crops and livestock, forests, fisheries and aquaculture in a holistic manner, as well as embracing the indispensable role of women, youth and Indigenous Peoples, as essential agents of change.

### [WTO: Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/26/wto-agreement-on-fisheries-subsidies/)

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**ET**](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/foreign-trade/civil-society-trade-experts-urge-india-not-to-ratify-wtos-agreement-on-fisheries-subsidies/articleshow/102084177.cms)

 **Context**: Trade experts and civil society members are urging **India not to ratify the fisheries subsidies agreement** recently agreed upon by the **World Trade Organization (WTO)** members.

**What is the Fisheries Subsidies Agreement at WTO?**

The fisheries subsidies agreement agreed upon by the WTO **prohibits subsidies for Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing and overfished stocks**. It also restricts **subsidies for fishing on the high seas**, outside the jurisdiction of coastal countries and Regional Fisheries Management Organizations.

**Transition Period**: Developing countries and Least Developed Countries (LDCs) are granted a **two-year transition period under Special and Differential Treatment (S&DT)** and are not obligated to implement disciplines during this period.

**Exemptions**:

The agreement **allows subsidies for vessels or operators not engaged in IUU fishing** and permits **subsidies to rebuild overfished stocks** to a sustainable level.

**Advantages for India:**

For India, the agreement is seen as **crucial to combat large-scale IUU fishing** that impacts coastal communities’ livelihoods and depletes fisheries resources.

**Concerns:**

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**Phys.org**](https://phys.org/news/2023-07-nature-breakthrough-hazard-free-production-fluorochemicals.html)

 **Context:** Researchers at the University of Oxford have achieved a groundbreaking breakthrough by **developing a new technique to produce fluorochemicals** without using **hazardous hydrogen fluoride (HF) gas**.

**What are Fluorochemicals and how are they produced?**

**Fluorochemicals are essential chemical compounds** used in various industries, including polymers, agrochemicals, **pharmaceuticals, and lithium-ion batteries**. They are known for their unique properties, including high thermal stability and resistance to chemicals.

Traditionally, fluorochemicals are produced through an **energy-intensive process** involving the use of **hazardous hydrogen fluoride (HF) gas**. HF is generated by reacting a **crystalline mineral called fluorspar (CaF2)** with sulfuric acid under harsh conditions. This process has safety risks and environmental consequences due to HF spills.

**What is the New Method?**

Inspired by the **natural biomineralization process that forms teeth and bones**, researchers successfully **activated solid-state calcium fluoride (CaF2)** through a mechanochemical process. This innovative method, named **Fluoromix**, allows for the **direct synthesis of over 50 different fluorochemicals from CaF2** with impressive yields of up to **98%**.

**Significance**: The new approach has the potential to enhance safety and environmental impact, streamline the supply chain, and reduce energy demands in the rapidly expanding global fluorochemical industry.
