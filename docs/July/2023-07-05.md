### [Uniform Civil Code](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/05/uniform-civil-code-7/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: Indian Constitution**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/push-for-uniform-civil-code-comes-even-as-supreme-court-is-yet-to-decide-the-ambit-and-scope-of-religious-freedom/article67031537.ece)

 **Context:** The push for a Uniform Civil Code is raising concerns about religious rights and personal laws, as the Supreme Court’s inquiry on religious freedom remains unresolved.

**What is UCC?**

**Uniform Civil Code** refers to the proposition of **having a uniform set of civil laws for all citizens of a country, irrespective of their religious or cultural affiliations**.

**The principle behind UCC:**

The concept of a UCC is **rooted in the idea of equality and uniformity before the law** and it **aims to replace the personal laws based on religious practices that currently govern matters such as marriage, divorce, inheritance, adoption, and succession.**

**Historical Perspectives on UCC**

- **British rule**: There was a **lack of uniformity in civil matter**s as **personal laws based on religious customs and traditions** were **recognized for different communities**. The idea of a UCC emerged as a **response to this fragmentation and as a means to promote a common civil identity.**
- **Portuguese rule**: **When Goa was under Portuguese rule until 1961, a Uniform Civil Code** based on the **Portuguese Napoleonic code** was implemented.
- **Nehruvian Vision:** Jawaharlal Nehru envisioned a **modern and progressive India** and saw the **UCC as an essential element of nation-building**. He believed that a UCC would **help eliminate divisions based on religion and promote equality among citizens.**
- **Hindu Code Bill**: The Hindu Code Bill sought to **codify and modernize Hindu personal laws relating to marriage, divorce, adoption, and inheritance.** It was seen as a **step towards a UCC, as it aimed to bring uniformity in personal laws within the Hindu community.**
- **Shah Bano Case:** The Supreme Court judgment, in this case, sparked debates on the need for a **UCC to ensure gender justice and equal rights for women across religious communities**.

**Constitutional Perspectives on UCC**

- **Constituent Assembly Debates**: During the framing of the Indian Constitution, the debates witnessed diverse viewpoints, with **some members advocating for a UCC as a way to promote gender equality and secularism, while others expressed concerns about preserving religious and cultural rights.**

- **Directive Principles of State Policy: Article 44** of the Indian constitution states that the **state shall endeavour to secure for its citizens a uniform civil code throughout the territory of India.**
- **Secularism**: The Indian Constitution enshrines the principle of secularism, which mandates the **separation of religion and the state**. A **UCC is seen as a way to promote secularism** by ensuring equal treatment of all citizens irrespective of their religious affiliations.
- **Equality and Non-Discrimination:** The Constitution of India guarantees **equality before the law under Article 14,** and prohibits **discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth.** UCC would uphold these principles by **ensuring equal rights and equal treatment for all citizens, regardless of their religious backgrounds.**
- **Gender Justice:** The Constitution also guarantees the **right to equality and the right against discrimination based on gender.** A UCC is seen as a means to promote **gender justice**.

**How do Personal laws govern different communities?**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Muslims, Hindus, Jains, Buddhists, Sikhs, Parsis, and Jews** are governed by their own personal laws.|   |   |
|Goa has UCC, which **retained its common family law** known as the Goa Civil Code after it was liberated from Portuguese rule in 1961. The rest of India follows **different personal laws based on their religious or community identity.**|   |   |
|**All Hindus**|**Reformed Hindu Personal Law**|Applies to Hindus after the enactment of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. Renounced Hindus still under Hindu Law|
|**Hindu Personal Law in Special Marriage Act**|Hindus married under the Special Marriage Act, 1954 are still governed by Hindu Personal Law.|
|**Muslims**|**Muslim Personal Law**|Muslims married under the Special Marriage Act, 1954 are no longer governed by Muslim Personal Law.|

**Argument in favour of UCC:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Benefits of UCC**|**Explanation**|
|**National Integration and Secularism**|UCC would create a **common identity among citizens**, fostering **national integration**. It promotes **secularism by treating all religions equally and reducing communal conflicts.**|
|**Gender Justice and Equality**|UCC ensures **gender justice by removing discriminatory laws** and granting **equal rights to women in marriage, divorce, inheritance**, etc. It empowers women and upholds their fundamental rights.|
|**Simplification and Rationalisation of Legal System**|UCC **simplifies the legal system** by eliminating the complexities and contradictions of multiple laws. It harmonizes civil and criminal laws and enhances accessibility for the common people.|
|**Modernisation and Reform of Outdated Practices**|UCC **modernizes and reforms outdated practices**, aligning personal laws with human rights and constitutional values. It abolishes practices like triple talaq and child marriage.|

**Argument Against UCC:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Challenges**|**Explanation**|
|**Diverse Personal Laws and Customary Practices**|Harmonizing India’s diverse laws and practices to establish **uniformity is complex**, especially when **many laws are undocumented or contradictory.**|
|**Resistance from Religious and Minority Groups**|Some religious and minority groups argue that it could impose majority views and undermine their constitutional rights, **particularly under Article 25 guaranteeing freedom of religion.**|
|**Lack of Political Will and Consensus**|Concerns exist regarding potential communal tensions and conflicts arising from its implementation.|
|**Practical Difficulties and Complexities**|Implementing UCC would involve substantial efforts such as drafting, codifying, harmonizing, and rationalizing personal laws and practices.|

[/su_note]

**Law Commission Views:**

- **21st Law Commission of India:** It said the **“issue of uniform civil code is vast, and its potential repercussions, untested in India”**. It said that **“ UCC is neither necessary nor desirable at this stage”.**
- The government had asked the **22nd Law Commission of India** to undertake an examination of various issues relating to UCC.

**SC-related cases:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Landmark Cases**|**Ruling and Implications**|
|**Shah Bano Case (1985)**|The Supreme Court upheld the right of a Muslim woman to claim maintenance from her husband even after the Iddat period.|
||It highlighted the need for a **UCC to remove contradictions based on ideologies.**|
|**Sarla Mudgal (**1995)|The Supreme Court stated that a Hindu husband cannot convert to Islam and marry without dissolving his first marriage.|
||It emphasized that a **UCC would prevent fraudulent conversions and bigamous marriages.**|
|**Shayara Bano case (2017)**|The Supreme Court declared triple talaq as unconstitutional and violative of Muslim women’s dignity and equality.|
||It recommended that **Parliament enact a law to regulate Muslim marriages and divorces.**|

**Conclusion:**

The implementation of a **Uniform Civil Code (UCC) in India** requires a balanced approach that respects **multiculturalism and diversity**. Inclusive discussions with stakeholders, including **religious leaders and legal experts**, are essential to ensure diverse perspectives are considered. The focus should be on **eliminating practices that hinder equality and gender justice while avoiding reactive culturalism**. The reform process of Muslim Personal Law should be led by the Muslim clergy, and Muslims should critically examine practices to promote equality and justice. The aim is to develop a **just and inclusive UCC that upholds constitutional values.**

**Quotes related to UCC:**

- **_“The implementation of a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) will promote the integration of India by establishing a shared platform for diverse communities”_** 
- **_“The Uniform Civil Code may potentially enforce a code that is influenced by Hindu practices in all communities”_**
- **_“It is imperative to ensure that certain groups or marginalised segments of society are not subjected to disadvantageous treatment during this endeavour”_**

### [One Health Priority Research Agenda on Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/05/one-health-priority-research-agenda-on-antimicrobial-resistance-amr/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Issues relating to health**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/health/one-health-fao-unep-who-and-woah-launch-research-agenda-for-antimicrobial-resistance-90388)

 **Context:** The Quadripartite – comprising the FAO, UNEP, WHO and the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) – released the One Health Priority Research Agenda on [Antimicrobial Resistance](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/02/antimicrobial-resistance-heres-what-can-be-done-to-address-environmental-amr-in-india/).

**The agenda defines** [**‘One Health’**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/05/06/insights-into-editorial-a-one-health-approach-that-targets-people-animals/)**:** The concept acknowledges the **health of humans, domestic and wild animals, plants, and the larger environment**, including ecosystems, are inextricably linked and interdependent.

**The link between ‘One Health’ and AMR:**

- At this One Health interface, addressing global health issues necessitates **a multisectoral, multidisciplinary response to AMR**.
- Using a mixed-methods approach, global experts identified five key pillars as well as three cross-cutting themes, as follows:

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/transmision.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/transmision.png)

**Five key pillars:**

- **Transmission:** This pillar focuses on the environment, plant, animal, and human sectors where AMR transmission, circulation and spread occur.
- **Integrated surveillance:** This pillar aims to identify cross-cutting priority research questions in order to improve common technical understanding and information exchange among One Health stakeholders.
- **Interventions:** This pillar focuses on programmes, practises, tools, and activities aimed at preventing, containing, or reducing the incidence, prevalence, and spread of AMR.
- **Behavioural insights and change:** It focuses on research addressing human behaviour that affects AMR, including ways to combat it.
- **Economics and policy:** This pillar takes into account the cost-effectiveness of an AMR investment case, financial sustainability, and long-term financial impact.

**Purpose of priority research agenda:**

- To better advocate for **increased research and investment** in antimicrobial resistance (AMR).
- **To guide a variety of stakeholders** in generating new evidence to address AMR, with a focus on low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
- The agenda also **emphasises the importance of developing research capacity in LMICs**, which will be critical for addressing research gaps and developing evidence.

**Significance of the agenda:**

- It will serve as **a guide for countries, research institutes and funding bodies** to support One Health AMR research.
- It will also **allow policymakers, researchers**, and the multidisciplinary scientific community to collaborate across sectors.

 **Other similar efforts:** WHO also launched a global research agenda for AMR in human health, **prioritising 40 research topics for evidence generation** to inform policy and interventions by 2030.

**Way ahead:** The priority research agenda requires **contextualisation** at the regional and country level and the development of specific research relevant to the needs of different countries and One Health settings.

**Conclusion:** Implementing this research agenda will address the threat of AMR and support the national action plan (NAP) implementation and achievement of the SDGs for 2030.

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Environment and Conservation/ Science and Technology- Developments and their Applications and Effects in Everyday Life.**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/climate-change/us-government-considers-controversial-solar-geoengineering-to-counter-global-warming-report-90364)

 **Context:** The US is eyeing a controversial tool to counter global warming: **Solar geoengineering**.

**What is Solar geoengineering?**

- Solar geoengineering, also referred to as **solar radiation management** (SRM) describes a set of proposed approaches to **reflect sunlight (back to space) to rapidly cool the Earth**.
- Within solar geoengineering, researchers are considering two main approaches.

**Different SRM methods:**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/solar_climate.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/solar_climate.png)

- **Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI):** It involves injecting tiny reflecting particles, known as aerosols, into the upper atmosphere to cool the planet.
- **Marine cloud brightening (MCB):** It would use sea salt to stimulate cloud formation over the ocean, which would also help reflect sunlight in the region.

**Why is solar geoengineering being considered?**

- **The Paris Agreement’s target** requires limiting global temperature increase well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C.
- For this, nations **need to bring net global CO2 emissions to zero by no later than mid-century**.
- Despite these ambitious goals, **solar geoengineering is being considered** to prepare for the possibility that global efforts may fall short.

**The USA’s plan:**

- The White House stated that **public or private actors could carry out activities such as injecting aerosols and MCB** to reflect more sunlight into space.
- It called for **research to enable better-informed decisions** about the potential risks and benefits of the tool as part of its climate policy, in addition to mitigation and adaptation.
- This comes amid concerns raised by the experts over the **high environmental** (changes in precipitation patterns, ozone amounts, sea-level rise, ocean acidification, etc)**, social, and geopolitical risks** that come with SRM.

**Solar geoengineering risks:**

- **Moral hazard:** The danger is that the technology will become an excuse to slow emissions reductions and stop moving toward a low-carbon economy.
- **Little is known about its impacts:** Research to scope the risks and potential of solar geoengineering has mostly been conducted through computer-based modelling and natural observations (volcanic eruption).

**Way ahead:** Because solar geoengineering has global implications, its consideration as a climate response requires **–**

- **Effective international governance**/ Mechanisms for oversight.
- **Outdoor experimentation** and funding for experiments should come only from governments.
- **Ways to involve the public in decision-making.**

**Conclusion:**

- Given the ethical and environmental risks these activities can present, atmospheric experiments to assess these technologies deserve **timely public scrutiny and debate.**
- Even as researchers assess the potential feasibility and effectiveness of geoengineering approaches, **mitigation and adaptation must remain our first-line solutions.**

### [Release of Treated Water into the Sea at Fukushima](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/06/release-of-treated-water-into-the-sea-at-fukushima/)

**Source:** [**IAEA**](https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/pressreleases/iaea-finds-japans-plans-to-release-treated-water-into-the-sea-at-fukushima-consistent-with-international-safety-standards)

**Context**: The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has conducted a safety review and concluded that Japan’s plans to release treated water from the **Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station into the sea** are consistent with international safety standards.

**Background of the event:**

In 2011, a **major nuclear accident occurred at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station** in Japan following a **massive earthquake and tsunami**. The natural disaster led to a **loss of power and cooling system failures**, resulting in the meltdowns of **three reactors** and the release of **radioactive materials**. It was one of the most significant nuclear accidents since the **Chornobyl disaster in 1986.**

**Water Treatment:**

Water stored at the site got contaminated during the incident. The contaminated water had caesium and strontium. They were removed periodically and now the water has been treated through an **Advanced Liquid Processing System (ALPS)** to remove almost all radioactivity, aside **from tritium**. Before discharging, Japan will **dilute the water to bring the tritium** to below regulatory standards.

**About IAEA:**

The International Atomic Energy Agency (HQ: Vienna; founded: 1957) is an **intergovernmental organization** that seeks to promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy and to inhibit its use for any military purpose, including nuclear weapons.

**Purpose:**

The IAEA strengthens the **global nuclear safety and security framework**. It identifies and promotes best practices and safety standards and implements programs to assist states in applying these standards. The IAEA is also a **key player in the effort to prevent nuclear terrorism.**
