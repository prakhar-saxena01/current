#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Government Policies and Interventions for Development in various sectors and Issues arising out of their Design and Implementation**

**Source:** [**LM**](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/lok-sabha-passes-multi-state-cooperative-societies-amendment-bill-11690347273525.html)

 **Context:** The Multi-State Cooperative Societies (Amendment) Bill 2023 was passed by the Lok Sabha.

**Cooperatives in India and issues faced by them:** 

**Meaning:** Co-operatives are voluntary, democratic, and autonomous organisations controlled by their members who actively participate in its policies and decision-making.

**Efforts to promote them:**

- **After independence,** the first five-year plan (1951-56) emphasised the adoption of co-operatives to cover various aspects of community development.
- **97th Amendment (2011):** It inserted Article 43B in the DPSP of the Indian Constitution inserted,
    - As per Article 43B. States shall endeavour to promote voluntary formation, autonomous functioning, democratic control and professional management of cooperative societies.

**Issues faced by the co-operatives:**

- Inadequacies in governance
- **Politicisation and the excessive role of the government**
- Inability to ensure active membership
- Lack of efforts for capital formation
- **Inability to attract and retain competent professionals**
- Elections to co-operative boards have been postponed indefinitely

**What are Multi-state Co-operative Societies?**

- Regulated by the **Multi-State Co-operative Societies Act 2002,** these are societies that have operations in more than one state (like FPOs).
- **Part IXB** (also inserted by the 97th amendment) of the Indian constitution is applicable only to multi-state co-operative societies (as per an SC verdict), as states have the jurisdiction to legislate over state co-operative societies.

**About the Multi-State Cooperative Societies (Amendment) Bill 2023:** It seeks to amend the Multi-State Co-operative Societies Act 2002.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Key features**|**2002 Act**|**2023 Bill**|
|**Election of board members**|Elections to the board are conducted by its existing board.|**Co-operative Election Authority:** The central government will establish the Authority to conduct such elections. It will consist of a chairperson, VC, and up to 3 members appointed by the central government on the recommendations of a selection committee.|
|**Amalgamation of co-operative societies**|Amalgamation and division by passing a resolution at a general meeting with at least two-thirds of the members present and voting.|Allows state co-operative societies to merge into an existing multi-state co-operative society, subject to the respective state laws.|
|**Fund for sick cooperative societies**||**Co-operative Rehabilitation, Reconstruction and Development Fund:** Multi-state co-operative societies that are in profit for the preceding three financial years shall finance the Fund.|
|**Restriction on redemption of government shareholding**|The shares held in a multi-state co-operative society by certain government authorities can be redeemed based on the bye-laws of the society.|Any shares held by the central and state governments cannot be redeemed without their prior approval.|
|**Redressal of complaints**||**Co-operative Ombudsman:** The central government will appoint one or more such Ombudsman with territorial jurisdiction.<br><br>They shall complete the process of inquiry and adjudication **within 3 months** from the receipt of the complaint.<br><br>**Appeals** (within a month) → Central Registrar appointed by the central government.|

**Importance of the Bill:**

- **By increasing their transparency** and implementing a system of frequent elections, it will strengthen cooperatives.
- The Bill aims to address issues with the **operation and governance** of cooperative societies as well as match its provisions with those in Part IXB of the Constitution.

**Issues related to the Bill:**

- **Imposing a cost on well-functioning societies:** Sick multi-state co-operative societies will be revived by a Fund that will be financed through contributions by profitable multi-state co-operative societies.
- **Dilute autonomy and independence of co-operatives:** By empowering the government to restrict redemption of its shareholding in multi-state co-operative societies.

 **Syllabus:** **Environment and Conservation**

**Source:** [**PIB**](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1943413#:~:text=Union%20Minister%20Bhupender%20Yadav%20said,Ministers%20meeting%20in%20Chennai%20today.)

 **Context:** The Union Minister of Environment Forest and Climate Change launched the Resource Efficiency [Circular Economy](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/26/editorial-analysis-moving-away-from-the-take-make-dispose-model/#:~:text=Circular%20Economy%3A,refurbishment%2C%20recovery%2C%20and%20repair.) Industry Coalition (**RECEIC**).

**Where?**

- It was launched on the sidelines of the **4th G20 Environment and Climate Sustainability Working Group (ECSWG)** and Environment and Climate Ministers meeting in **Chennai**.
- **The ECSWG meets to discuss** the pressing environmental issues and promote global collaboration towards a sustainable and resilient future.

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/linear_eco.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/linear_eco.png)**

**Founding members:**

- As many as **39 multinational corporations (MNCs)** from sectors such as steel, FMCG, electronics came together to join RECEIC**.**
- **They pledged to adopt** resource efficiency and circular economy principles to address environmental challenges rising from waste, including plastics, microplastics, e-waste, and chemical waste.

**What is the RECEIC?**

- **Conceptualised by India’s G20 Presidency,** it is envisaged to be industry-driven and a self-sustaining initiative continuing to function even beyond India’s G20 Presidency.
- **The mission of this coalition** is to –
    - Facilitate and foster **greater company-to-company collaboration**,
    - Build advanced capabilities across sectors and value chains,
    - Bring learnings from the diverse and global experiences of the coalition members, and
    - **Unlock on-ground private sector action** to enhance resource efficiency and accelerate circular economy transition.
- The coalition is structured around the **3 guiding pillars of partnerships** for impact, technology cooperation and finance for scale.

**Significance of RECEIC:**

- It would play a pivotal role in promoting alliances, encouraging technological cooperation and knowledge transfer, fostering innovation, and facilitating the exchange of insights to enhance access to finance.
- It will contribute towards progress on **key global goals and priorities** set by the G20 and other international fora.
- **RECEIC will also act as an overarching platform** enabling industries to address information gaps and coordination challenges across the G20 members.

**Other efforts of the Indian government to promote a circular economy:**

- **The E-Waste (Management) Rules 2016:** To curb the improper disposal of electronic products and to promote sustainable e-waste management practices.
- **The Plastic Waste Management (Amendment) Rules 2022:**
    - It establishes **Extended Producers’ Responsibility** (EPR) guidelines. EPR is an environmental protection strategy that makes the manufacturer of the product responsible for the entire life cycle of the product.
    - Under this, 2.6 million tonnes worth of EPR certificates had been generated by plastic waste processors and around 1.51 million tonnes of those certificates had been purchased by PIBOs (Producers, Importers and Brand owners).
- **Swachh Bharat Mission – Urban 2.0:** The focus is on source segregation of garbage, utilising the 3Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle), scientific processing of municipal solid waste, etc.

**Challenges for circular economy in India:**

- **Industries are reluctant to adopt the circular economy model** due to supply chain limitations, lack of incentives to invest in recycling and remanufacturing processes, etc.
- **Many people in India are not familiar with the concept** of a circular economy and its benefits.
- **India’s current infrastructure may not be well-equipped** to support a circular economy. **For example**, insufficient recycling facilities and waste management systems.
- **There is a cultural resistance** to the idea of reusing and recycling products in India.

**Conclusion:**

Industry-led coalition on resource efficiency and circular economy has the potential to transform aspirations into concrete actions. However, behavioural changes are an important prerequisite for this transformation.

### [The State of climate in Asia 2022](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/29/the-state-of-climate-in-asia-2022/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Environment and Conservation**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/climate-change/extreme-continent-new-wmo-report-paints-alarming-picture-of-climate-emergency-in-asia-90882)

 **Context:** According to the State of climate in Asia 2022 report released by the [World Meteorological Organisation (WMO)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/03/26/world-meteorological-organisation-wmo/#:~:text=What%20is%20it%3F,as%20oceanography%20and%20atmospheric%20chemistry.), Asia is the world’s most disaster-prone region.

**About the report:**

- One of a series of WMO regional State of the Climate reports, it was released during a meeting of the **UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific’s** (ESCAP) Committee on Disaster Risk Reduction.
- **UN ESCAP** (HQ: Bangkok; founded in 1947) is one of the five regional commissions under the jurisdiction of the United Nations Economic and Social Council.

**Highlights of the report:**

- **Over 50 million people** were directly affected due to 81 weather, climate and water-related disasters in Asia during 2022.
- **The number of disaster events in the region decreased** in comparison to 2021 (over 100 natural hazards).
- **But the effects of such events in 2022** were much more pronounced, with an increase in the number of fatalities, people affected and economic damage.
    - **For example,** ~5,879 Asians died due to natural disasters in 2022 – 55% more than in 2021.
- **The economic cost of the damage** has been over $ 36 billion and Pakistan accounted for 42% of this.

**Floods and droughts in 2022:**

- **The economic losses** associated with floods exceeded the average over the past 20 years (2002-2021).
    - This was primarily due to the significant economic losses from floods in **Pakistan** (over $15 billion), **China** (over $5 billion) and **India** (over $4.2 billion)
- **The economic losses associated with drought** ($7.6 billion), mainly occurred in China, exceeding the 20-year average by nearly 200%.
    - If compared with 2021, the economic cost of drought had more than doubled.

**Challenges ahead:**

- **Asia**, the continent with the largest land mass extending to the Arctic, **is warming faster than the global average**.
    - **In 2022**, the estimated mean temperature over Asia was 0.73°C above the 1991-2020 average, making it either the second/ third warmest year on record.
- **Global melting ice, glaciers and sea level rise**, threatening more socio-economic disruption in the future.
    - **For example**, in the north-east Indian Ocean and western tropical Pacific region sea level is rising at the rate of above 4 mm per year.
- The expected increase in the frequency and severity of extreme events over much of Asia will impact **agriculture**.
    - **More than 25% of all climate-related loss and damage** is associated with the agriculture sector.

**Way ahead:**

- **As early warnings** are one of the most effective ways of reducing damage from disasters, significant gaps to be addressed to strengthen these systems.
- **Agriculture sector** must be central in all climate adaptation planning.

### [Parkachik Glacier in Ladakh](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/29/parkachik-glacier-in-ladakh/)

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**DST**](https://dst.gov.in/3-new-lakes-may-form-parkachik-glacier-ladakh-due-glacial-retreat)

 **Context:** A new study conducted by scientists from the **Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology reveals changes in the Parkachik Glacier in Ladakh, India.**

- The research also estimated the surface ice velocity of the glacier, **showing a reduction of about 28% in the lower ablation zone between 1999-2000 and 2020-2021.**

Based on simulations, if the glacier continues to retreat at a similar rate, **the study predicts that three lakes of different sizes may form due to subglacial over-deepening.**

**There are two main reasons for the rapid melting of the glacier:**

- First is global warming and increasing temperatures in the region
- Second is that it is at a lower altitude than other glaciers in the Zanskar region

**About the glacier:** 

**Parachik Glacier is a mountain glacier in Kargil, Ladakh**. It is a mass of ice moving slowly down the Nun-Kun slopes. This ice mass falls finally into the Suru River. It is one of the largest glaciers in the Suru River valley, covering an area of 53 square km and is 14 km long. The Suru River valley is a part of the southern Zanskar Ranges in the western Himalayas

### [Gulf Stream](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/29/gulf-stream/)

**Source:** [**BBC**](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-66289494)

 **Context:** A scientific study has raised concerns that the **Gulf Stream system**, known as the **Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), could collapse as early as 2025.**

- The AMOC drives the **Atlantic’s currents and plays a crucial role in determining Europe’s weather**. If it were to collapse, it **could lead to lower temperatures and catastrophic climate impacts**.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s most recent assessment suggests that the collapse of AMOC may not happen as quickly as the study proposes. **The complexity of the climate system makes it difficult to have certainty about the exact timing and occurrence of such a collapse.**

**About Gulf Stream:**

The Gulf Stream is a powerful ocean current in the **North Atlantic Ocean**. It originates in the **Gulf of Mexico and flows north-eastward along the eastern coast of the United States**, then across the **Atlantic towards Europe**. It plays a significant role in **regulating the climate by transporting warm water and heat** from the tropics to higher latitudes, influencing weather patterns and temperatures in coastal regions.

**About AMOC:**

It is a **large system of ocean currents.** It is the **Atlantic branch of the ocean conveyor belt or ThermoHaline Circulation (THC)** and distributes heat and nutrients throughout the world’s ocean basins.

- AMOC carries **warm surface waters from the tropics towards the Northern Hemisphere, where it cools and sinks.**
- It then **returns to the tropics and then to the South Atlantic as a bottom current**. From there it is distributed to all **ocean basins via the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.**

The Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) celebrated its **17th foundation day** with the launch of several citizen-centric initiatives.

Aim: These initiatives aim to enhance **weather services, disseminate information, and promote ocean-related services and biodiversity.**

**Major Initiatives launched:**

- **Four new meteorological centres** were inaugurated in Imphal (Manipur), Kohima (Nagaland), Aizawl (Mizoram), and Port Blair (Andaman and Nicobar).
- **A new website for disseminating** alerts for block-level weather forecasts and advisories to benefit our agricultural community, including farmers, fisherfolk, and livestock rearers. The website will be accessible at [https://www.greenalerts.in/](https://www.greenalerts.in/).
- **Rainfall Atlas of India (1971-2020):** prepared by IMD, using data from 4389 rain gauges and is expected to provide resources for various agencies, researchers, students and operational meteorologists.
- **Indian Ocean Biodiversity Information System (IndOBIS):** a web portal that features the biodiversity of the Indian Ocean Exclusive Economic Zone and also provides information on marine species of the Indian Ocean.

**About MoES:** 

The Ministry of Earth Sciences was **formed on 29 January 2006 (HQ: New Delhi) from a merger of the India Meteorological Department**, the National Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting, the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, the Earth Risk Evaluation Centre, and the Ministry of Ocean Development. It plays a crucial role in providing services for weather, climate, ocean, hydrology, and seismology.

### [Ancient pathogens released from melting ice could wreak havoc on the world](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/29/ancient-pathogens-released-from-melting-ice-could-wreak-havoc-on-the-world/)

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/climate-change/ancient-pathogens-released-from-melting-ice-could-wreak-havoc-on-the-world-new-analysis-reveals-90887)

 **Context**: The article discusses the potential risks associated with the **release of ancient pathogens from melting ice in response to global warming.**

- For example, recently a **30,000-year-old virus** was revived from **Siberian permafrost**, and an **anthrax outbreak was linked to the thawing of spores in western Siberia.**
- The warming climate, **particularly in colder regions like the Arctic, is accelerating the melting of ice, potentially releasing vast numbers of microorganisms**, including ancient pathogens. However, the **exact risk posed by these pathogens to modern ecosystems remains uncertain.**

A new study published in the journal **PLOS Computational Biology** used simulations to estimate the **ecological risks of releasing ancient pathogens**. The results showed that just one percent of simulated releases of a **single dormant pathogen could lead to significant environmental damage and widespread loss of host organisms worldwide.**

- While the risk from a single pathogen might seem small, **the sheer number of ancient microbes being released increases the overall danger.**
- If these **pathogens were to establish themselves in modern environments, they could become a potent driver of ecological change, potentially leading to species extinction.**

Although the study did not model the potential risk to humans, there is a concern that these **“time-travelling” pathogens could enter human populations through zoonotic pathways**, similar to how viruses like SARS-CoV-2, Ebola, and HIV likely originated from animal hosts.
