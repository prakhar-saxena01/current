### [Extreme rain events: How unusual, what is causing them](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/12/extreme-rain-events-how-unusual-what-is-causing-them/)

#### **GS Paper 1**

 **Syllabus:** **Physical Geography of India (Drainage, Climate)**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/north-india-himachal-rains-flood-climate-explained/article67064497.ece)

 **Context:** Northern India is currently in the midst of an extremely wet phase of the monsoon.

**What is an extremely heavy rainfall event?**

- It occurs when **more than 205 mm of rainfall** happens at any place within a 24-hour period. (IMD)
- Such events of extremely heavy rainfall are **not unexpected** during the monsoon season.
- After the 2013 Uttarakhand tragedy, there has not been a single year without at least one major disaster-like situation produced by an extreme rainfall event.

**Trends in recent years:**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/trends.jpg?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/trends.jpg)

- **Overall rainfall** during the monsoon **has remained more or less constant** over the last two decades.
- **But the intra-seasonal variation has increased –** fewer days are producing a bulk of the seasonal rainfall, while the rest of the days remain dry.

**How is this year’s monsoon rainfall unusual?**

- The monsoon season this year was not expected to be very wet.
- July rainfall in Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh is **substantially higher** (by 26%) **than normal**.
- Heavy rain has resulted in **large-scale destruction and loss of lives**, particularly in the hilly areas.

**[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/monson.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/monson.png)**

**Reasons for this extreme rainfall:**

- **Rains induced by the Biparjoy cyclone:** By the first two weeks of the monsoon, India had accumulated a rainfall deficit of more than 50%. However, this deficit had come down to 8% by the end of June.
- **Western disturbances:** IMD has attributed this spell to an interaction between the monsoon winds and western disturbances that converged over northern India.
- **Climate change:** It is known to increase the possibility, frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, including heavy rainfall and heat waves.
- **Warming of the Arabian Sea:** Excess rainfall over northwest India is consistent with the Arabian Sea having warmed by about 1.5 degrees Celsius since January.

**How can Indian cities bring themself out of these troubled waters?**

- The authorities need to plan the usage of shallow aquifers to prevent waterlogging.
- At the same time, the city needs to recharge the deeper aquifers with rainwater.
- Forming a **water plan to recharge aquifers**
- **Rainwater harvesting structures** along the stormwater drains can help mitigate floods while utilizing rainwater resources.

**Conclusion:** Only improved forecasts with sufficient granularity in space and time can reduce the element of surprise resulting from these extreme weather events.

### [Impact of India’s demographic journey on Women’s Lives](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/12/impact-of-indias-demographic-journey-on-womens-lives/)

#### **GS Paper 1**

 **Syllabus:** **Role of Women and Women’s Organization**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/demographic-transition-and-change-in-womens-lives/article67068561.ece#:~:text=Demographic%20shifts%20also%20affect%20women's,to%20reach%2021%25%20by%202050.)

 **Context:** World Population Day (July 11) is a time to look at how India’s demographic journey has changed the lives of its citizens, particularly its women.

**India’s population:**

- It grew from about 340 million at Independence to **4 billion**.
- **This growth was fuelled by** the improvement in public health, food security, etc. **For example,** male life expectancy was about 56 years (in 1941); today, it is 69 years.
- With this rapid decline in mortality, **parents no longer needed to have four children** to ensure that at least two would survive.
- As a result, the **Total Fertility Rate (TFR)** fell from 5.7 in 1950 to 2.1 in 2019.

**Impact of reduced TFR:**

- It brought a **tectonic shift in the lives of Indian women**.
- Women’s childhood, adulthood, and old age have been **transformed** (both positively and negatively) **over the course of the demographic transition**.

**Change for Indian women:**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Childhood**|**Adulthood**|**Old age**|
|Sex-selective abortions have declined – girl-survival rate improved|**Creating space for education:** With a fertility decline, active mothering occupies a smaller proportion of women’s lives.<br><br>**Lower female labour force participation:** By the time peak childcare demands end, they have missed the window for occupations that require specific skills; only unskilled work is open to them.|Women generally marry men who are older and are more likely to outlive their husbands.<br><br>The 2011 Census shows that while only 18% of men above age 65 are widowed, **about 55% of the women are widowed.**<br><br>For widowed women, the lack of access to savings and property results in **dependence on children, mainly sons, bringing the vicious cycle of son preference to full circle.**|

**Way ahead:**

- **Women need to establish secure connections** to the labour market and gain work experience if they are to get skilled jobs.
- **Enhancing women’s access to employment and assets** will reduce their reliance on sons and could break the vicious cycle of gendered disadvantage.
- As early marriage and childbearing remain central to Indian women’s lives, any efforts at improving women’s labour force participation **must be accompanied by access to safe and affordable childcare.**

**How to ensure access to safe and affordable childcare?**

- **National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS)** can be used to develop social infrastructure where NREGS workers can help staff crèches.
- The burgeoning self-help group movement can be harnessed to set up **neighbourhood child-care centres** in urban and rural areas.

**Best practice:** Crèche facilities in Anganwadis in MP led to an increase in the work participation of mothers.

**Conclusion:** Demographic dividends cannot be realised without fully harnessing the gender dividend. As changing patriarchal norms may take a long time, improving access to childcare (for working women) is a low-hanging fruit.

### [Multidimensional poverty Index](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/12/multidimensional-poverty-index/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Issues Relating to Poverty and Hunger**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/india-registers-remarkable-reduction-in-poverty-with-415-million-people-coming-out-of-it-in-15-years-united-nations/article67066698.ece)

 **Context:** According to the global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) 2023, a total of 415 million people moved out of poverty in India within just 15 years from 2005/2006 to 2019/2021.

**What is the global MPI?**

- It is a key international resource that measures (annually) acute multidimensional poverty across more than 100 developing countries.
- **First launched in 2010 by UNDP** and Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI)**, the global MPI advances SDG 1 – ending poverty in all its forms everywhere.**
- It also measures interconnected deprivations across indicators related to SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 11.

**How does it measure multidimensional poverty?**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/dimension.png)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/dimension.png)

- **By constructing a deprivation profile** for each household and person **across 10 indicators** spanning **health, education and standard of living.**
- **A person is multidimensionally poor** if s/he is deprived in one-third/33% or more of the weighted indicators out of the 10 indicators.
- Those who are deprived of one-half or more of the weighted indicators are considered living in **extreme multidimensional poverty.**

**Significance of the global MPI:** It monitors poverty reduction and informs policy, showing how people experience poverty in different aspects of their daily lives.

**The 2023 global MPI:**

- **Prevalence:**

- **Reduction:**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/poverty_.png)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/poverty_.png)

**Good news: 25 countries, including India**, successfully halved their global MPI values within 15 years.

**Concerns:**

- **Child poverty** will continue to be a pressing issue, particularly in relation to school attendance and undernutrition. The poverty rate among children is **27.****7%,** while among adults is 13.4%.
- **Poverty predominantly affects rural areas**, with 84% of all poor people living in rural areas.
- **The lack of comprehensive data** during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic poses challenges in assessing immediate prospects.
- **The negative impacts of the pandemic** in dimensions such as education are significant and can have long-lasting consequences.

**Case of India:**

- In 2005/2006, about 645 million people were in multidimensional poverty in India, with this number declining to about 370 million in 2015/2016 and 230 million in 2019/2021.
    - Thus, **415 million** poor people moved out of poverty from 2005/2006 to 2019/2021.
- Incidence fell from 55.1 to **16.4%**.
- **Deprivation in all indicators declined.**
- The poorest states and groups, including children and people in disadvantaged caste groups, had the fastest absolute progress.
- The above findings are significant as **India surpassed China** (in Apr 2023) to become the world’s most populous nation with **142 crore people.**

**Way ahead:**

- **Intensify efforts** to comprehend the dimensions most negatively affected.
- **Strengthen data collection and policy efforts** to get poverty reduction back on track.
- **Broaden the picture** to include the impacts of the pandemic on children.

**Conclusion:** The report demonstrates that poverty reduction is achievable, demonstrating the feasibility of the SDG target – **ending poverty in all its forms everywhere by 2030.**

The use of wastewater for public health surveillance offers significant benefits for disease prevention and control. It is a **cost-effective approach** that does not rely on invasive samples from individuals. Wastewater surveillance, integrated with existing **surveillance mechanisms**, could enhance **India’s epidemiological capabilities** by providing real-time insights into **community-level disease patterns**. This integration could be facilitated through efforts to strengthen public health laboratory networks and the **Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission.**

**Usage**: Wastewater surveillance for community disease prevention can be used as a point or way forward

### [Last Natural Person Above Every Person Clause](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/12/last-natural-person-above-every-person-clause/)

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/adani-hindenburg-case-lack-of-requirement-to-disclose-last-natural-person-above-every-person-owning-economic-interest-in-fpis-is-the-challenge-sebi-to-sc/article67063642.ece)

 **Context:** The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) clarified in the Supreme Court that the challenges it faced in the **Hindenburg-Adani allegations case** were from the lack of a requirement to disclose the **‘last natural person above every person’ owning an economic interest in the FPIs.**

**What is ‘Last Natural Person Above Every Person’?**

It refers to the requirement to **identify and disclose the ultimate individual** who has control or ownership over a financial investment such as Foreign Portfolio Investor (FPI). It means revealing the **final person in the ownership chain** who holds an economic interest in the FPI, ensuring transparency and accountability in the investment structure.

However, most of the national and international laws don’t have such provisions,

**FPI Vs FDI?** 

- **FPI (Foreign Portfolio Investment)** refers to investments made by foreign individuals or entities in financial assets such as stocks, bonds, or mutual funds of a country.
- **FDI (Foreign Direct Investment),** on the other hand, refers to investments made by foreign individuals or entities **in tangible assets** such as businesses, properties, or infrastructure projects in a country. FDI typically involves a **long-term commitment and a significant level of control and ownership** in the invested entity, while FPI involves relatively **shorter-term investments** in financial instruments without obtaining control or ownership rights.

**Challenges posed by FPIs:**

- FPIs use multiple platforms, each below the limit for beneficial owner identification, to hold stakes (thus remaining below the radar of regulatory agencies)
- FPIs operate in tax haven jurisdictions, creating ambiguity around their ownership and control.

**SEBI’s recently Proposed Disclosure Requirements for FPIs**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Proposal**|**Explanation**|
|**Tighter Rules for High-Risk FPIs**|FPIs with over 50% concentration in a single group or assets valued above Rs 25,000 crore will be categorized as high-risk. They must provide additional details about ownership, economic interests, and control rights.|
|**Transition Period and Adherence**|FPIs with more than 50% exposure to a single corporate group will have a six-month transition period to reduce their exposure before complying with additional disclosure requirements.|
|**Detailed Ownership Information and Enhanced Transparency**|SEBI aims to gather comprehensive ownership information of FPIs, including details about natural persons, public retail funds, and large public-listed companies, to improve transparency in the market.|
|**Stricter FPI Disclosure Standards**|If approved, the proposed rules will make India’s FPI disclosure standards among the strictest globally, ensuring greater transparency and accountability in the financial system.|
|**FPI Categorization**|SEBI suggests categorizing FPIs based on their risk levels. Government entities, central banks, and sovereign wealth funds will be considered low-risk, while pension funds and public retail funds will be categorized as moderate-risk. All other FPIs will fall under the high-risk category.|

**Context:**  Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman stated that the Indian economy has overcome the twin-balance sheet problem and now **enjoys a twin-balance sheet advantage**.

**What is the Twin-Balance Sheet problem?**

The twin-balance sheet problem refers to a situation in which **both banks and corporates face financial distress simultaneously**. It occurs when banks have a high amount of non-performing assets (bad loans) (NPA of public sector banks reached almost 12% in 2016-17) on their balance sheets, and corporates have accumulated excessive debt, leading to a negative impact on the overall economy.

**RBI’s recent Financial Stability Report** states that both banking and corporate sector balance sheets have strengthened and India might be on the cusp of a **twin balance sheet advantage**.

- **The gross NPA ratio** fell to a 10-year low **of 3.9%.**
- The corporate balance sheet is also at its healthiest in 10 years.
- **The profitability of public sector banks** has tripled since 2014, reaching over ₹1 lakh crore in 2022-23.

**Some of the initiatives taken by the government are:**

- **4R strategy** (recognizing, recapitalizing, resolving, and reforming);
- **Central Repository of Information on Large Credits** (CRILC) to enable banks to share information on large loans;
- **Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code**, 2016
- **National Asset Reconstruction Company**(NARCL) to handle bad debt

 **Context:** The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) has issued a standard operating procedure (SoP) to **prevent the use of freebies, illicit liquor, and other prohibited items to lure voters** during upcoming elections in India.

**What is SoP?**

It is a set of guidelines and instructions that define how a particular task or process should be carried out. SoPs are created to ensure consistency, efficiency, and compliance with established protocols.

**About SoP by CBIC:**

- **Aim:** The SoP aims to ensure fair and transparent elections by preventing the flow of suspicious cash, illicit liquor, drugs/narcotics, freebies and smuggled goods during assembly and general elections.
- **Monitoring:** In line with the **directions of the Election Commission**, CBIC has instructed its field officials **to monitor both monetary and non-monetary inducements** used during the election process.
- **Surveillance**: The officials will establish surveillance teams, conduct checks on vehicles and warehouses, and apprehend smuggled goods. Setting up **flying squads and static surveillance** teams for vehicles check and verification of warehouses.
- **Confiscation**: Movement of items like saris, party flags etc. associated with candidates or political parties without an e-way bill may be confiscated.
- **Reporting**: The tax officers will report their activities to the Election Commission on a daily basis.

**About CBIC:**

It is a government body under the **Ministry of Finance in India**. It is responsible for **formulating policies related to customs, excise duties, GST, and narcotics.** CBIC oversees the administration and collection of these taxes and is the administrative authority for its subordinate organizations. These include Custom Houses, Central Excise and GST Commissionerates, and the Central Revenues Control Laboratory.

### [New Wheat Variety](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/12/new-wheat-variety/)

 **Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/education/pau-develops-new-wheat-variety-to-keep-blood-sugar-obesity-in-check-8822510/#:~:text=Eating%20chapatis%20made%20from%20this,more%20slowly%20into%20the%20bloodstream.)

 **Context:** The Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) has developed a new variety of wheat called **PBW RS1**, which has **high amylose starch content**.

**Advantages:**

- **Reduce the risks of type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases**: Chapatis made from this wheat release glucose more slowly into the bloodstream, providing a feeling of satiety and potentially reducing the **prevalence of diet-related diseases**.
- It is resistant to **yellow rust and moderately resistant to brown rust fungal diseases**.

**Concern:**

It has slightly lower productivity compared to other varieties.

**About Starch:**

 **Context:** A new study has revealed that Injecting ageing monkeys with a ‘**longevity factor’ protein** that can **restore levels of Klotho**, can improve their cognitive function, a study reveals.

**What is Klotho?**

Klotho is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the KL gene and produced in Kidney. Circulating levels of soluble Klotho decrease with age and the Klotho gene is associated with increased risk of age-related diseases.

**Significance of the findings**: The findings could lead to new treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.

Previous research on mice had shown that **injections of klotho can extend its lives and increase synaptic plasticity** (the capacity to control communication between neurons, at junctions called synapses).
