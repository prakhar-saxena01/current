### [Cyclones: How are cyclones formed and named?](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/08/cyclones-how-are-cyclones-formed-and-named/)

#### **GS Paper 1**

**Syllabus:** **Important Geophysical Phenomena such as cyclones etc.**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/imd-cyclone-mocha-formation-details-explained-8596533/)

**Context:** According to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), a cyclonic/low-pressure area is developing in the Bay of Bengal and may intensify into a cyclonic storm.

**What this weather system be called?** Cyclone **Mocha** (pronounced ‘Mokha’) –  a name suggested by **Yemen** after the Red Sea port city, which is known to have introduced coffee to the world over 500 years ago.

|**What is a cyclone and how are they formed?**|   |
|**Meaning**|A cyclone is a low-pressure system that forms over warm waters.|
|**Mechanism of formation**|**A high temperature anywhere means the existence of low-pressure air,** and a low temperature means high-pressure wind.<br><br>**As air warms over hotter regions it ascends**, leading to low pressure at the surface it is covering.<br><br>In a depression or low-pressure situation, the air is rising and blows **in an anticlockwise direction** (in the northern hemisphere) around the low.<br><br>This is because of the **Coriolis effect**, a result of the earth’s rotation on its axis.|
|**Favourable conditions**|**Warm seas** present ripe conditions for the development and strengthening of cyclones and fuel these systems over the water.|
|**Effects**|As warm air rises and cools, **water vapour condenses to form clouds** and this can lead to rains.|
|**Most vulnerable region**|Weather systems formed over the **Bay of Bengal** in the peak of summer in May are among the strongest in the North Indian Ocean region.|
|**Threats**|Can lead to **individual hazards** such as **storm surge, flooding, extreme winds, tornadoes and lighting** → loss of life and material damage.|

**How are cyclones named?**

- They are named by the **regional specialised meteorological centres** (RSMCs) and **Tropical Cyclone Warning Centres** (TCWCs).
- There are **six** RSMCs in the world and **five**
- As an RSMC, the **IMD names the cyclones developing over the north Indian Ocean**, including the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea.
- The IMD is also mandated to issue advisories to **12 other countries in the region on the development of cyclones and storms.**

**WMO/ESCAP (World Meteorological Organisation/United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific):**

- In **2000**, the group (comprising Bangladesh, India, the Maldives, Myanmar, Oman, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Thailand), **decided to start naming cyclones in the region.**
- After each country sent in suggestions, the WMO/ESCAP **Panel on Tropical Cyclones** (PTC) finalised the list.

### [Agricultural exports-imports](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/08/agricultural-exports-imports/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus:** **Indian economy, agriculture and related issues**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/india-farm-exports-drivers-risks-explained-8596742/)

 **Context:** Both agricultural exports from and imports into India have scaled new highs in the fiscal year that ended March 31, 2023.

**Provisional data of Department of Commerce on agri imports-exports:**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/agri_trade.jpg?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/agri_trade.jpg)

- **Agricultural trade surplus (Exports – Imports):** It has **marginally dipped** from $17.82 billion to $17.46 billion.
    - The surplus **narrows further if one adds the import of fertilizers**, which have risen from $14.17 billion in 2021-22 to $17.21 billion in 2022-23.

**The drivers – global prices:**

- The **UN FAO’s Food Price Index** (FPI) – a weighted average of world prices of a basket of food commodities over a base period value (2014-16 = 100) – **remains high since 2020-21.**
- It made India’s agri-commodities more globally price **competitive**.

**Major export-import contributors:**

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/agri-expo.png)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/agri-expo.png)**

**Export profile:**

- **Basmati exports** are mainly to the Persian Gulf countries, while **non-basmati** shipments are more diversified, spreading across –
    - **Asia** (Bangladesh, China, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Vietnam, UAE and Iraq) and
    - **Africa** (from Senegal, Ivory Coast and Benin to Somalia and Madagascar).
    - **It’s non-basmati that has made India the biggest rice exporter, ahead of Thailand.**
- **In sugar exports**, the country has emerged as the **world’s No. 2 exporter after Brazil.**
    - Indian mills have built markets for both **raw sugar** (among refineries in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia and Iraq) and
    - **Regular plantation whites** (in African countries, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and China).
- **Spices exports** have stagnated since 2020-21.
- The exports of **raw cotton, guar-gum** (a thickening agent used in extraction of shale oil and gas) **and oil meals**, have declined.

**Imports profile:**

- Imports meet roughly 60% of India’s vegetable oil requirements, 10% of pulses.
- **Imports of spices, cashew and cotton** – commodities where India has traditionally been a net exporter – have shown a rising trend.

**Concerns:**

- **Unfavourable regulatory regime:**
    - **Cultivation of GM Bt cotton** and high global prices had enabled India to become the world’s top producer (ahead of China) and No. 2 exporter (after the US) of natural fibre.
    - But, as the government is **not permitting new gene technologies**, the country has turned from a net exporter to an importer of cotton.
- **Domestic crop shortages**: Specially in cotton, soyabean, guar-gum and oil meal.
- Spice imports going up are a reflection of **reduced price competitiveness** (vis-à-vis Vietnam in pepper and Guatemala in pepper).
- **Export curbs:** The government banned wheat exports, broken rice exports and slapped a 20% duty on all non-parboiled non-basmati shipments.

**Government steps to promote agricultural exports:**

- **Agriculture Export Policy (2018):** It aims to harness export potential of Indian agriculture to make India a global power in agriculture and raise farmers’ income.
- **‘District as Export Hub’ Initiative** of the Department of Commerce would be utilised to achieve the objectives of Agriculture Export Policy.
- **Transport and Marketing Assistance for Specified Agriculture Products** – a Central Sector Scheme to mitigate the freight disadvantage for the export of agriculture products.
- Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (**TIES**)
- Market Access Initiatives (**MAI**) Scheme
- **The Export Promotion Schemes** of APEDA

**Risks ahead:**

- **International prices:** The latest FPI reading showing declining trends.
- **Domestic food inflation, more curbs on exports and a further liberalisation of imports** if the ensuing southwest monsoon season delivers subnormal rainfall.

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

 **Source:** [**TH**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/08/mission-2023-insights-daily-current-affairs-pib-summary-8-may-2023/thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/new-diseases-and-initiatives-prompt-health-ministry-to-widen-and-rename-ncd-programme/article66816673.ece)

 **Context:** The **National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS)** in India has been renamed the National Programme for Prevention & Control of Non-Communicable Diseases (NP-NCD) due to the addition of new diseases and health initiatives.

- It has been renamed to subsume **all types of NCDs**.
- Also, Comprehensive Primary Healthcare Non-Communicable Disease (CPHC NCD IT) system has been renamed as the **National NCD Portal** 

**What is non-communicable disease?**

Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are a group of **chronic medical conditions** that are not caused by infectious agents and cannot be transmitted from one person to another but are caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors.

- g., cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, and mental disorders.
