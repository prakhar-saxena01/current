### [Code of Conduct for civil servants](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/26/code-of-conduct-for-civil-servants/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Role of Civil Services in a Democracy**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/civil-services-conduct-8628406/)

**Context:** Specially designed Conduct Rules govern a civil servant’s behaviour and conduct.

**What are the civil services?**

- **There are 3 All India Services** (governed by [**Article 312**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/governance/role-of-civil-service-in-a-democracy/framework-of-civil-service-structure-in-india/) of the Indian Constitution) – the IAS, IPS and the Indian Forest Service (IFoS) – with officers allotted to various state cadres by the central government.
    - The Centre then gets a certain percentage of officers from each state on **central deputation.**
- **Other services** are called Central Civil Services (such as the Indian Foreign Service, the Indian Revenue Service, Customs and Central Excise Service, etc).
    - These are **under the central government with no state cadre system**.

**Rules governing civil services:**

- There are two sets of rules for civil servants – one for AISs (The AIS Conduct Rules, **1968**) and the other for CCSs (The CCS Conduct Rules, **1964**).
- These were framed based on recommendations from a committee – **Committee on Prevention of Corruption headed by K Santhanam** – constituted in 1962.

**Code of conduct highlighted in the rules:**

- Every member of the Service shall –
    - **Maintain high ethical standards**, integrity and honesty; political neutrality; accountability and transparency; fairness and impartiality; responsiveness to the public, etc.
    - **Use public resources efficiently,** effectively and economically; declare any private interests relating to his public duties to resolve any conflict of interest.
    - **At all times maintain devotion to duty**, and do nothing which is unbecoming of a member of the Service.
- No member of the Service shall –
    - **Use his/her position to secure employment** for any of his/her family members with any private undertaking/NGO;
    - Give or take or abet the giving or taking of
- **A member of the service may accept gifts** from his near relatives or friends having no official dealings with them.
    - But, he shall report to the government **if the value of such gift exceeds Rs.25,000.**
- While members can hold personal political beliefs, these rules restrict the degree to which they can act on them. **For example,** members not allowed –
    - To be part of, assist political parties; interfere with or take part in an election to any legislature or local authority.
    - To criticise any current policy or action of the government. However, civil servants are allowed to express their opinion on official documents.

**Penalties for transgressions:**

- Major penalties can include “**dismissal**” from the service as well.
- Besides, there are also the penal provisions mentioned under the [**Prevention of Corruption Act (POCA).**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2018/11/27/prevention-of-corruption-act/)

**Issues with the Conduct Rules:**

- **Vague:** For example, while the promotion of casteism is not covered under any specific Conduct Rules, casteist behaviour can be interpreted as “unbecoming of a member of the Service”.
- **Ambiguous:** Ideas like personal integrity are not well defined. That is why evils like taking dowry are banned but seemingly common.
- **There is no ethical code for civil servants in India.**

### [Water dispute between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/26/water-dispute-between-andhra-pradesh-and-telangana/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus****: Inter-State water dispute**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/explained-the-telangana-andhra-pradesh-water-dispute/article66880971.ece)

 **Context:** The [water dispute](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/functions-and-responsibilities-of-the-union-and-the-states-issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure-devolution-of-powers-and-finances-up-to-local-levels-and-challenges-therein/issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure/inter-state-relations/inter-state-water-disputes/) between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, stemming from the **Krishna River,** remains unresolved even after **nine years since the bifurcation** of the combined state.

**About the Dispute:**

The dispute began with the **erstwhile Hyderabad and Mysore states** and later continued between successors Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. It originated from the **Gentlemen’s Agreement signed in 1956**, which aimed to protect the **Telangana region’s interests regarding water resources**. In 1969, the **Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal (KWDT)** was set up under the [**Inter-State River Water Dispute Act, of 1956**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/04/18/inter-state-river-water-disputes-act-1956-2/#:~:text=Art%20262%20provides%20for%20the,state%20river%20and%20river%20valley.), and presented its report in 1973. It divided water between **Karnataka, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh.**

After the bifurcation of the state, both states have proposed new projects (e.g., the project to increase **Krishna water utilization above the Srisailam Reservoir)** without proper clearance from **river boards and authorities** as required by the **Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014**. This led to **complaints and disputes** between the two states. Also, Telangana has been **pushing for an equal share**.

**Legal Provisions:  
**

The Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 mandates for the **constitution of an Apex Council by the Central Government** for the supervision of the functioning of the **Godavari River Management Board and Krishna River Management Board**. The Apex Council comprises the **Union Water Resources Minister and the Chief Ministers of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.**

**Constitutional provisions:** 

**Inter-State River Water Disputes**: Under Article 262, Parliament may by law provide for the **adjudication of any dispute or complaint** with respect to the use, distribution and control of waters of any inter-state river and river valley. The Parliament enacted two laws, **the River Boards Act (1956) and the Inter-State Water Disputes Act (1956).**

**About River board:**

The River Boards Act provides for the establishment of **river boards by the Central government for the regulation** and development of inter-state rivers and river valleys. **A River Board is established** at the request of state governments concerned to advise them.

**About Inter-State Water Disputes Act:**

**It** empowers the Central government to set up an **ad hoc tribunal for the adjudication of a dispute** between two or more states in relation to the waters of an inter-state river or river valley. The decision of the tribunal **is final and binding on the parties** to the dispute. **Neither the Supreme Court nor any other court is to have jurisdiction** in respect of any water dispute which may be referred to such a tribunal under this Act.

**Way forward:**

To address water disputes effectively, it is **necessary to establish a permanent tribunal** with **Supreme Court’s appellate jurisdiction** and **amend Article 262** and the Inter-State Water Disputes Act. Communication channels must be improved for **consensus-building**, and the central body should represent states adequately. The Ministry of Jal Shakti has issued a gazette notification **defining the jurisdiction of river management boards**, which can help overcome challenges. **Clear demarcation of power** for each state should be followed.

Context: According to the latest UN inter-agency estimates, India has **the highest child-wasting rate** globally, **with over 18% of Indian children** affected by wasting in 2020.

**Other findings:**

- India had a **stunting** rate of **31.****7 per cent** in 2022, down from **41.6** per cent in 2012
- India had an **overweight percentage** of **2.****8 per cent in 2022**, compared to **2.2 per cent** in 2012.
- India is the **largest country in southern Asia**, where **half of all children** with wasting in the world live
