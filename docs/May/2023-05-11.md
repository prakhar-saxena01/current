### [The battle to end child marriage](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/11/the-battle-to-end-child-marriage/)

#### **GS Paper 1**

 **Syllabus****:** **Social issues**

**Source:** [**UNICEF**](https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/global-polycrisis-creating-uphill-battle-end-child-marriage-unicef)

 **Context:** According to UNICEF, multiple crises are threatening to reverse hard-earned gains in the decline in child marriage.

**Child marriage:**

- It refers to any formal marriage or informal union **between a child under the age of (18 for females and 21 for males in India)** and an adult or another child.
- Most child marriages involve girls, many of whom are in poor socio-economic conditions.

**Data on child marriage:**

- Worldwide, an estimated 640 million girls and women alive today were married in childhood, or **12 million girls per year.**
- Child marriages have **declined from 21 to 19% (globally)** since the last estimates were released five years ago.
- However, global reductions would have to be 20 times faster to meet SDG (**5.3**) of ending child marriage by 2030.

**Status in India:**

- While **India** has recorded significant progress in recent decades, **it still accounts for one-third of the global total** (India’s child marriage rate is 21% as per NHFS-5).
- **Eight States** have a higher prevalence of child marriage than the national average – West Bengal, Bihar and Tripura top the list with **more than 40% of women** aged 20-24 years married below 18.

**Most affected regions:**

- **South Asia** continues to remain home to nearly half (45%) of the world’s child brides.
- **Sub-Saharan Africa** is home to the second-largest global share of child brides (20%).

**Highlights of the UNICEF’s findings:**

- The world is engulfed by a **‘Polycrisis’** – a cluster of related global risks with compounding effects, such that the overall impact exceeds the sum of each part.
- **Health and economic crises** (rising poverty, income shocks), escalating armed conflicts, **climate change shocks** and the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 are forcing families into **child marriage**.
- Girls living in fragile settings are **twice as likely to become child brides** as the average girl globally.

**Fig: Factors Driving Child Marriage**

**Immediate and lifelong consequences on girls:**

- **Less likely to remain in school.**
- **Difficult for girls to access** health care, social services and community support that protect them from child marriage.
- **Increased risk of early pregnancy** → increasing the risk of child and maternal health complications and mortality.
- Can also **isolate girls** from family and friends, taking a **heavy toll on their mental health and well-being.**

**Laws and policy interventions in India:**

- **The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act 2006 and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act 2012** aim at protecting children from violation of human and other rights.
- A parliamentary standing committee is weighing the pros and cons of **raising the age of marriage for women to 21**, which has been cleared by the Union Cabinet.
- **Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana:** The government launched this scheme in 2015 to encourage parents to save money for the future of their girl child
- **Kanyashree Prakalpa Scheme:** The West Bengal government launched this scheme in 2013 to promote the **education and welfare of girls and prevent child marriage** in the state.
- **National Plan of Action for Children:** The plan includes strategies to prevent child marriage and promote education and healthcare for children
- Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao (BBBP) Scheme

**Way ahead for India:**

- The solution lies in **empowering girls, creating proper public infrastructure and addressing societal norms**.
- **At the gram panchayat level,** ensuring that Child Protection Committees and Child Marriage Prohibition officers are doing the job and activating community support groups.
    - **Best practice:** Odisha now has over 12,000 Child Marriage Free Villages.

**Conclusion:**

It is possible to end child marriage, which requires unwavering support for vulnerable girls and families. The focus should be on keeping girls in school and making sure they have economic opportunities.

### [Insufficient Representation of Women in India’s Workforce](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/11/insufficient-representation-of-women-in-indias-workforce/)

#### **GS Paper 1**

 **Syllabus:** **Role of women**

**Source:** [**BBC**](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-65530408)

 **Context:** India surpassed China as the world’s most populous country, which led analysts to highlight the potential benefits of India’s demographic dividend.

**A major obstacle to realising this potential:** Insufficient representation of women in India’s workforce.

**Significance of more women in the workforce:** India could add $550bn to its GDP by increasing its female labour force participation by just 10% (McKinsey).

**What does the data say?** Nearly half of India’s population is female and yet, the female participation rate in India’s labour force has consistently fallen from its peak in **2000 (31%**) to a low of **21% in 2018** (World Bank).

**Reasons for this:**

- **India is still a largely patriarchal society**:
    - Indian women spend 8 times the number of hours on **unpaid care work compared with men.** The global average is 3 times.
    - **Only 32% of Indian women work after they get married** and most of them are part of the agricultural sector.
- **Safety concerns**: Not being able to find jobs close to home also prevent women in big cities from joining the workforce.
- **Insufficient formal wage employment opportunities:** For example, women employees account for less than 20% of India’s manufacturing sector.
- **Concentration in low/non-productive jobs:** Like agriculture, primary caregiver at home, etc.
- **Lack of opportunities for women returning** to their careers after a professional break.
- Higher level of participation in education and **increase in the family income.**

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/meso.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/meso.png)**

**Steps taken:**

- A new **Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship** has been established to coordinate the skill development schemes across various sectors.
- The **National Career Service (NCS) Project** provides a nationwide online platform for job seekers and employers.
- **The Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act 2017** provides for enhancement in paid maternity leave from 12 weeks to 26 weeks and provisions for mandatory crèche facilities.
- An advisory to the States under the **Factories Act 1948** for permitting women workers in the night shifts with adequate safety measures.
- A network of **Women Industrial Training institutes,** National Vocational Training Institutes and Regional Vocational Training Institutes.
- A number of protective provisions have been incorporated in various labour laws – **The Equal Remuneration Act 1976, The Minimum Wages Act 1948.**

**Best practices:**

- **TVS (one of India’s biggest two-wheeler manufacturers):** Offers a scheme for women who are returning to their careers (after the break) with flexible working hours, mentoring and training to them.
- **Gabriel India Ltd [An auto parts company in Hosur (Tamil Nadu)]:** It provides perks such as on-site accommodation, subsidised food and training programmes to attract more women workers, as their attrition rates are lower compared to their male counterparts.

**Way ahead:**

- **A policy framework** encouraging and enabling women’s participation should be constructed.
- Active awareness of the “**gender-specific**” constraints that face most women.
- **Gender-responsive policies** need to be contextually developed.
- The goal is not merely to increase female labour force participation, but to provide **opportunities for decent work** → contribute to the economic empowerment of women.

**Conclusion:** Women’s labour force participation and access to decent work are important and necessary elements of an **inclusive and sustainable development (SDG 5) process.**

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: Social Justice: Health**

**Source:** [**WHO**](https://www.who.int/news/item/09-05-2023-global-progress-in-tackling-maternal-and-newborn-deaths-stalls-since-2015--un) 

**Context**: According to a report by the **United Nations** global progress on improving maternal and newborn health has halted since 2015.

**Objective of the report:** It outlines progress at the mid-point for the achievement of the **Sustainable Development Goals**, and highlights priority actions towards eliminating preventable maternal and newborn deaths and stillbirths.

**Global Findings:**

- Global progress in reducing deaths of pregnant women, mothers and babies has **stagnated for eight years**
- **Deaths**: Over **4.****5 million** women and babies die every year during pregnancy, childbirth or the first weeks after birth – mostly from **preventable or treatable causes if proper care** was available.
    - **290 000 maternal deaths** each year
    - **1.9 million stillbirths** (babies who die after 28 weeks of pregnancy )
    - **2.3 million newborn deaths** (in the first month of life)

**India Findings:**

- **India tops the list of 10 countries** which bear **60% of global maternal deaths**, stillbirths & newborn deaths burden
- **India accounts for 17 per cent** of global maternal deaths, stillbirths and neonatal births

**Despite the high numbers, As per the Sample Registration System (SRS) report** by the Registrar General of India (RGI), the Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) of **India has reduced from 130 per 100,000 live births in 2014-16 to 113 per 100,000** live births in 2016-18.

**Reasons for the halt in progress:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Reasons**|**Examples**|
|**Decreasing investments in maternal and newborn health**|Just **1 in 10 countries** (of more than 100 surveyed) report having sufficient funds to implement their health schemes related to maternal and newborns.|
|**Lack of Infrastructure**|**Less than a third of countries** report having sufficient newborn care and maternal care units.|
|**Prematurity (the leading cause of under-five deaths globally)**|According to the report, every year**, 2.5 million babies** are born **prematurely**, and one million of these babies die due to complications.|
|**COVID-19 pandemic**|Around a **quarter of countries** still report ongoing disruptions to vital pregnancy and postnatal care and services for sick children.|
|**Rising poverty**|Poverty can impact access to quality maternal and child healthcare services, nutrition, and education.|
|**Worsening humanitarian crises**|For example, the **current crisis in Sudan and the Russia-Ukraine** war can affect access to healthcare services and supplies.|
|**Gender inequality**|**Only about 60% of women aged 15-49 years** make their own decisions regarding sexual and reproductive health and rights. This can affect access to healthcare services and information.|

**Recommendations:**

- Scale-up access to quality **sexual and reproductive health services** as part of universal health coverage and primary health care
- **Use of technology**: E.g., using a simple, low-cost collection device called a ‘drape’ to reduce blood loss during delivery
- **Addressing harmful gender norms**, biases and inequalities
- **Investment and political** commitment
- **Strengthening service delivery** for quality and respectful care
- Community engagement
- Data and information systems
- Access to quality **emergency obstetric care (EmOC)**

**Targets to be achieved:**

|   |
|---|
|Frame an action plan **to end preventable newborn deaths**|
|**Build strategies for** ending preventable maternal mortality|
|90% of pregnant women **receiving at least four antenatal care contacts**|
|**Skilled health personnel** attending 90% of births|
|80% of new mothers and babies **receive postnatal care within two days of birth**|
|80% of districts across countries have access **to emergency obstetric services and small and sick newborn care**|

### [Strategic convergence between the US, UAE, Saudi Arabia](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/11/strategic-convergence-between-the-us-uae-saudi-arabia/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **International Relations**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/c-raja-mohan-writes-how-strategic-convergence-between-us-uae-saudi-arabia-and-india-can-help-delhi-8600655/)

 **Context:** The meeting in Riyadh between Saudi Arabia and the US, UAE, and India underlines the growing strategic convergence between Delhi and Washington in the Gulf.

**What is unique about this meeting?**

- **A major departure** **from the traditional approaches** to the Middle East in both India and the US.
- **In India**, the Nehruvian foreign policy either opposed Washington or kept its distance from the US in the Middle East.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Recent changes in India’s foreign policy**|**Impact**|
|**Shedding its “anti-Western” lens in the Middle East.** Joining hands with the **US** (in the Middle East), openly showcased its friendly relations to **Israel**.|Transformed India’s relations with the two Arabian kingdoms – Saudi Arabia and the UAE, into **solid strategic partnerships**.|
|**France** has emerged as an important partner in the Gulf and the Western Indian Ocean. India now has a **trilateral dialogue** with Abu Dhabi and Paris.|The formation of a **four-nation grouping** (in October 2021) called **I2U2** brought the US, India, Israel, and the UAE together.|
|**Delhi and London** are expected to work together in the Gulf soon. Britain enjoys much residual influence in the Gulf.|**A new quadrilateral** with the US, UAE, and Saudi Arabia.|

**Recent changes in USA’s foreign policy (recalibrating its regional strategy):**

- **Pakistan** was a key part of the **Baghdad Pact (1955),** Central Treaty Organisation (CENTO) and the Regional Cooperation for Development (1964) to counter the Communist threat to the region.
- However, it **does not figure in the current strategy** to connect the Gulf with the Subcontinent.
- This means the US is **discarding its pro-Pakistan bias** in thinking about the relationship between the Subcontinent and the Gulf and building **new partnerships**, including with Delhi.

**What led to the changes in the foreign policies of India and the US?**

- **The decline in the Role of Pakistan in the Middle East:**
    - Pakistan’s continuing strategic decline, and **socio-economic-political challenges.**
    - **Pakistan has drifted too close to China** (all-weather partnership), tempted to align with China and Russia in the region.
- **The rising power of the Arabian Peninsula:**
    - The Gulf kingdoms (especially Saudi Arabia and the UAE) have **accumulated massive financial capital and economic transformation** will reduce their dependence on oil.
    - They have also begun to **diversify** their strategic partnerships, develop nationalism, promote religious tolerance and initiate social reform.

**India’s new possibilities in the Arabian Peninsula:**

- **Regional partnership** with the US is seen in terms of geopolitical competition with China, elevating its own standing in the region.
- **Economic growth** and productive involvement in promoting **connectivity and security.**
- Overcoming violent religious extremism within the Subcontinent.

**Challenges:** Beijing is now the second most important power in the world, and its diplomatic and political influence in the Gulf region will continue to rise.

**Conclusion:** Seizing the new strategic opportunities in the Gulf would involve the long overdue modernisation of Delhi’s strategic discourse on the Gulf.

### [Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/11/indo-pacific-economic-framework-ipef/)

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**BS**](https://www.business-standard.com/industry/news/india-frets-over-us-proposal-seeking-advance-notices-on-tariff-at-ipef-123050801002_1.html)

 **Context:** India fears that a proposal by the US under the “supply chains” pillar of the IPEF could violate WTO rules and reduce policy space.

**US proposal:** All IPEF partner nations would be required to **give advance notification of any changes to export regulations and tariffs.**

**India’s concern:** Notifications are usually done only after measures are taken and not before. India has therefore sought industry inputs to protect its interests.

**The IPEF:**

- It is an **economic initiative** launched by the US President Joe Biden on May 23, **2022**.
- The framework launched with a total of **14 participating founding member nations** in the Indo-Pacific region with an open invitation for other countries to join.
- The IPEF members represent **40% of the global GDP and 28% of the world’s trade.**
- Analysts have compared it to the **Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)**, which the US withdrew from in **2017**.

**The IPEF has four pillars:**

- **Trade, supply chains, clean economy, and fair economy.**

### [Build-Operate-Transfer (toll) model](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/11/build-operate-transfer-toll-model/)

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**FE**](https://www.financialexpress.com/business/roadways-building-highways-build-operate-transfer-toll-model-to-be-tweaked-further-to-regenerate-interest-of-investors-3077984/)

 **Context:** The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is working on increasing the share of the **Build-Operate-Transfer (toll) model in highway construction to 10% of the total awards**

**Status of the model used:**

As per the ICRA report: EPC will remain the mainstay of awarding contracts, accounting for **70-75% of total projects** offered while BOT will be less than 5%.

**Aim of NHAI:** Building **60% of highways through HAM**, **30% through EPC**, and **10% through BOT (toll).**

**Changes proposed in BOT:**

- NHAI will offer **only viable projects with land already tied up for bidding**, which can be completed on their own or with viability gap funding.
- NHAI will **commit 90% of the construction zone** (land for execution) for such projects
- **Flexibility has been given to concession holders**, allowing them to change ownership after a year instead of two years as was the rule earlier.
- Innovations like **dispute resolution boards and sharing of traffic risk** have been provided to make BOT (toll) more attractive.

**Comparison of three models:**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Engineering, Procurement, and Construction Model**|**Build-Operate-Transfer Model**|**Hybrid Annuity Model**|
|The government **pays private players to lay roads**. The private player has no role in the road’s ownership, toll collection or maintenance (it is taken care of by the government)|**Private players build, operate and maintain** the road for a specified number of years before transferring the asset back to the government.|**A mix of EPC and BOT:** NHAI releases 40 per cent of the total project cost. The balance of 60 per cent is arranged by the developer|
|**Risk**: Borne by NHAI|Borne by concessionaire|Shared between NHAI and concessionaire|
|**Cost sharing:** NHAI bears the full cost|The concessionaire bears construction and O&M costs|NHAI and concessionaire share construction and O&M costs|
|**Ownership**: NHAI owns the project from beginning|Concessionaire owns the project for the concession period, then transfers to NHAI|Concessionaire owns the project for 15 years, then transfers to NHAI|
