### [Why has the RBI withdrawn Rs 2,000 notes?](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/20/why-has-the-rbi-withdrawn-rs-2000-notes/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Indian Economy and issues relating to Planning, Mobilization of Resources, Growth, Development and Employment**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-2000-rupee-notes-withdrawal-why-has-the-rbi-done-this-8619041/)

**Context:** The RBI has decided to withdraw the Rs 2000 denomination banknotes from circulation.

**When were the Rs 2000 banknotes introduced?**

- **On November 8 2016**, the PM of India announced [**demonetisation**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Demonetisation-Scheme.pdf), withdrawing two banknotes (Rs 500 and Rs 1000) from circulation with immediate effect.
- The Rs 2000 and the new Rs 500 note were introduced **under (Section 26) of the RBI Act 1934**, primarily with the objective of meeting the currency requirement of the economy expeditiously.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Demonetisation**|   |
|**Meaning**|It is the process of eliminating the lawful acceptance status of a monetary unit → **The existing types of currency are withdrawn through circulation and supplanted with new currency.**|
|**Need**|**While demonetization is exceptional**, governments around the globe have used it to check – [**hyperinflation**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-economy-3/inflation/) **situations, counterfeit currency, terror and tax fraud,** and to introduce a new monetary system in some circumstances.|
|**Advantages**|Control criminal activities forbid tax avoidance and other financial crimes, contribute to a **paperless financial system**|
|**Disadvantages**|Expenses issuing new currency and coinage minting can be high, illegal activity will not be stopped entirely and may create chaos among individuals|
|**Primary reasons for demonetisation in India in 2016**|To check fake currency notes and to break the grip of corruption and black money.|
|**Effect on India**|[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/impact.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/impact.png)|
|[**The SC’s (4:1) verdict on demonetisation**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/03/supreme-court-upholds-demonetisation-what-was-the-challenge-about/)|[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/judge.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/judge.png)|

**Why has the RBI withdrawn Rs 2000 notes?**

- **With the fulfilment of the objective**, the printing of Rs 2000 notes was **stopped in 2018-19.**
- The RBI issued the majority of the Rs 2000 denomination notes prior to March 2017 – **now at the end of their estimated lifespan of 4-5 years.**
- Therefore, in pursuance of the **Clean Note Policy of the RBI**, it has been decided to withdraw the Rs 2000 denomination banknotes from circulation.

**What is the Clean Note Policy?**

- The policy was introduced in **1999** by the then RBI Governor: Bimal Jalan.
- It seeks **to give the public good-quality currency notes** and coins with better security features, **while soiled notes are withdrawn** out of circulation.
- Under the policy, the RBI had earlier decided to **withdraw from circulation all banknotes issued prior to 2005** as they have fewer security features.

**Will the Rs 2000 banknotes continue to be legal tender?**

- The public can continue to use Rs 2000 banknotes for their transactions and also receive them in payment.
- However, they are **encouraged to deposit/exchange** these banknotes on or before September 30, 2023. The RBI has not clarified the status of these notes after September 30.

**Could there be a repeat of the demonetisation chaos of 2016?**

- **It is unlikely**, as the printing of Rs 2000 notes was stopped in 2018-19, and they are **no longer commonly seen with the public** (constitute **only 10.8%** of notes in circulation).
- Also, the decision to withdraw Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes was **announced suddenly,** taking the public by surprise.

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Achievements of Indians in Science & Technology**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/indias-women-in-science-and-their-struggle-8619055/)

 **Context:** Two books – **Lilavati’s Daughters (2008) and Lab Hopping (2023)** – highlight the **complicated relationship between science and gender** in India.

**Some notable women scientists of India:** Anandibai Joshi (India’s first woman physician), Iravati Karve (India’s first woman anthropologist),  Anna Mani (India’s first woman meteorologist), **Dr N Kalaiselvi** (currently, at the helm of CSIR), **V R Lalithambika** (leading the Gaganyaan mission)

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2001.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2001.png)

**Data on** [**women in science**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/08/23/women-in-science/) **in India:** As per the latest “Research and Development Statistics 2019-20” of the Department of Science and Technology (DST), **India has 16.6% of women researchers** directly engaged in R&D activities.

**The obstacles that hold women back include:**

- Lack of representation, deeply entrenched **patriarchy**
- **Institutional apathy**
- **Poor working conditions,** sexual harassment
- **Familial issues** like marriage, family responsibility (twin burden of home and the workplace), relocation due to transferable job of the spouse, etc.

**Impact:** Dropout from higher studies, career break, overage for scientific jobs and prolonged absence from place of work or even resignation from the job.

**The government has taken several corrective steps:**

- **Knowledge Involvement in Research Advancement through Nurturing (KIRAN) Scheme:** Instituted to encourage women in the field of S&T.
    - **Women Scientist Scheme (WOS)** under KIRAN provides career opportunities, especially for those who had a break in their career.
    - **The Mobility Scheme** under KIRAN addresses relocation issues of working women scientists and provides support in project mode for 2-5 years.
- **Consolidation of University Research through Innovation and Excellence in Women Universities (CURIE) Programme**.
- **Indo-US Fellowship for Women in STEMM** (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics & Medicine) encourages Indian women scientists to undertake international collaborative research.
- **Vigyan Jyoti Scheme:** Encourages girl students of Class 9 to 12 to pursue education and career in S&T.
- **Biotechnology Career Advancement and Re-orientation Programme (BioCARe)** of the Department of Biotechnology (DBT).
- **National Award for woman scientist:** To recognize the contribution of women scientists in the field of Earth System Sciences.
- Multifaceted initiatives (like Women Entrepreneur’s Quest (WEQ) Programme) have been launched by DST to encourage women’s entrepreneurship under **Start-up India-Stand up India.**

**Conclusion:**

STEMM is the prime engines that have steered national growth and created a self-reliant India. Hence, equal participation of both men and women in STEMM will help India realise ‘**Amrit Kaal**’ in the true sense.

### [Globalization and Climate Change](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/20/globalization-and-climate-change/)

**GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus: Environment Conservation**

**Source:** [**LM**](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/globalization-will-work-better-for-planet-earth-than-its-alternative-11684432132103.html)

 **Context:** McKinsey Global Institute studies and WTO are of the view that globalization is necessary for the path to sustainability and mitigating the impact of climate change.

**What is Globalization in the context of the Environment?**

Globalization, in terms of the environment, refers to the **interconnectedness and interdependence** of economies and societies worldwide, leading to the global exchange of goods, services, information, and ideas. It has both **positive and negative environmental impacts**.

**Why is Globalization  Necessary for decarbonization?**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Aspect**|**Reasons**|**Example**|
|**Resource Distribution**|The materials and resources are not evenly distributed globally. Globalization allows for the **efficient sourcing and trading** of resources from areas with abundant supply to areas with high demand.|**E.g., Lithium**, is primarily sourced from **Australia and Chile**, and **its global availability is essential** for the widespread adoption of electric vehicles|
|**Technological Innovation**|Globalization promotes the exchange of **knowledge, ideas, and technological advancements** across borders.|**E.g., Sharing of R&D** in renewable energy technologies like **solar panels and wind turbines** has accelerated their deployment and reduced costs globally.|
|**Access to Financing**|Globalization allows **for cross-border financial flows,** making it easier for countries to access the necessary capital and investment for decarbonization projects.|E.g., the [global carbon credit trading mechanism](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/01/29/rstv-in-depth-carbon-trading-climate-change/)|
|**Scalability and Economies of Scale**|Globalization enables the establishment of **global supply chains, allowing for large-scale manufacturing** and distribution of renewable energy technologies.|E.g., **Tesla company’s Giga factory** for the manufacture of EV batteries in China, Australia and the USA|
|**Knowledge Sharing and Policy Alignment**|Globalization facilitates the sharing of **best practices, expertise, and policy frameworks** among countries.|E.g**.,**  [**Paris Agreement**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/07/08/financial-and-technological-commitments-under-unfccc-and-paris-agreement/), [International Solar Alliance](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/05/06/international-solar-alliance-6/#:~:text=ISA%20brings%20together%20countries%20with,solar%20R%26D%20and%20capacity%20building.) etc.,|

**How globalization leads to a negative impact on the environment:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Negative Impact**|**Description**|
|**Carbon Emissions**|Globalized trade **increases** carbon emissions from **shipping, air travel, and long-distance transportation of goods.** E.g., importing goods from distant countries to meet consumer demands leads to **increased emissions** from transportation.|
|[**Deforestation**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/environment-degradation-and-issues/deforestation-and-forest-degradation/#:~:text=Deforestation%20causes%3A,degraded%20environment%20with%20reduced%20biodiversity.) **and Habitat Loss**|Global demand for commodities like **timber, soy, and palm oil drives** deforestation and habitat loss in regions with rich biodiversity. E.g., the expansion of **palm oil plantations in Southeast Asia** has led to extensive deforestation and the loss of critical ecosystems.|
|**Pollution and Waste**|E.g.,  the **export of electronic waste from developed to developing countries** for recycling often leads to improper disposal and pollution.|
|**Overconsumption of Resources**|Globalization and increased trade have fueled a **culture of consumerism,** leading to higher resource consumption.|
|**Loss of Cultural Diversity**|Globalization can lead to the **homogenization of cultures, eroding traditional practices and knowledge** that are often environmentally sustainable.|

**Few major efforts for sustainable globalization:** Corporate Sustainability Initiatives; Circular Economy Transition; Sustainable Trade Initiatives (WTO); and [Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) (SDGs)

**Conclusion:**

Balancing the benefits of globalization with environmental sustainability requires careful consideration and implementation of policies and practices that mitigate its negative effects while maximizing its positive contributions to decarbonization and environmental protection.

### [Single-teacher schools (Jharkhand)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/20/single-teacher-schools-jharkhand/)

#### **Content for Mains Enrichment (CME)**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/inside-jharkhands-single-teacher-schools/article66867851.ece)

**A single-teacher school refers** to a school where there is only one teacher responsible for teaching all the students across different grade levels. A significant number of government schools in Jharkhand have only one teacher, despite the [**Right to Education Act**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/issues-related-to-education-sector/right-to-education/) mandating a **minimum of two teachers** for schools with up to **60 students**.

**Reasons:** The lack of recruitment over the years and the **government’s apathy** towards education in marginalized communities are cited as reasons for the prevalence of single-teacher schools.

**Impact:** Teachers in **single-teacher schools** are faced with several challenges, such as heavy workloads, limited resources, and administrative tasks. Students struggle with learning and lack age-appropriate education. **Marginalized communities** are particularly affected. The schools also suffer from **poor infrastructure** and inadequate support systems.

**Usage**: Such an example can be used to highlight issues with the education sector in India.

 **Context:** India successfully flew its **first commercial passenger flight** using an indigenously produced Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) blend.

**What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel?**

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a type of aviation fuel that is produced from **renewable sources,** unlike traditional fossil-based jet fuels. It is considered sustainable because it has a **significantly lower carbon footprint** and reduces greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional jet fuel.

**Source of SAF**: It can be derived from various feedstocks, such as plant oils, agricultural waste, forestry residues, and municipal solid waste.

**Advantages**: SAF can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to **80% compared** to conventional jet fuel. Also, it is designed to be a **drop-in replacement for conventional jet fuel**, meaning it can be used in existing aircraft engines without requiring modifications.

**Significance for India**: It is a significant milestone in **India’s efforts towards achieving** [**net-zero emissions by 2070**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/11/02/india-will-achieve-net-zero-emissions-by-2070/#:~:text=India%20will%20achieve%20net%20zero%20emissions%20latest%20by%202070.,GDP%20by%20less%20than%2045%25.). India has set a target of becoming **energy self-reliant by 2047**
