### [Misleading food ads and regulations to curtail them](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/12/misleading-food-ads-and-regulations-to-curtail-them/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: Governance: Government Policies and Interventions**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/explained-misleading-food-ads-and-regulations-to-curtail-them/article66815388.ece)

 **Context:** The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has **flagged 32 new cases of misleading advertisements** and claims made by food business operators.

- FSSAI has referred the cases to **licensing authorities and warned that offenders** face penalties of up to **INR 10 lakh or suspension or cancellation of licenses** for repeated offences.

**What are misleading advertisements?**

Misleading advertisements are those that make false or exaggerated claims about a product or service with the intention of deceiving consumers.

**Examples of misleading advertisements:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Company**|**Misleading Claim**|
|**Detox Tea Co.**|“Lose 10 lbs in 7 days with our tea”|
|**Beauty Products Inc.**|“Eliminates wrinkles in one day”|
|**Bourn Vita**|“Our drink is low in sugar” (when it contains high sugar content)|
|**Fresh Teeth Inc.**|“Whitens teeth 10 shades in one use”|
|**Hair Care Co.**|“Regrows hair in 2 weeks”|
|**Social Networking Inc.**|“100% safe and secure”|

**Impact of misleading advertisement:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
||**Examples**|
|**Loss of Customer Trust**|**Volkswagen** used deceptive **advertising to market their diesel cars** as environmentally friendly, causing damage to the environment and a loss of trust in the company by customers.|
|**Negative Brand Image**|PepsiCo’s advertising campaign for Aquafina bottled water, which claimed the water was “**pure, perfect and refreshing,”** was misleading because the water was sourced from tap water.|
|**Legal Consequences**|L’Oreal was sued by the **Federal Trade Commission** (USA) for advertising that their anti-ageing creams could mimic the effects of a surgical facelift.|
|**Health Impact**|For example, sugary drinks such as soda are associated with many health problems.|
|**Ethical impact**|Unfair Competition, Breach of Trust, Deception and Manipulation|

**Legal provisions against misleading advertisements:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Legal Provisions**|**Description**|
|**CCPA’s Guidelines to Prevent False or Misleading Advertisements**|Issued in 2022, these guidelines cover goods, products, and services, and aim to **prevent false or misleading advertising.**|
|**Food Safety and Standards Regulations, 2018**|Specifically **deals with food** (and related products), and regulates product claims, while the above guidelines deal with goods, products and services.|
|**Cable Television Network Rules, 1994**|Advertisements **must not** draw inferences that it has “**some special or miraculous or supernatural property** or quality, which is difficult to prove.|
|**FSS Act 2006**|Misleading ads are punishable under **Section 53** of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006.|
|**Consumer Welfare Fund**|Set up under the **Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) Act, 2017**, this fund **promotes and protects the welfare of consumers.**|
|**Central Consumer Protection Council**|**Monitors and enforces consumer protection laws** facilitates consumer education, and provides consumer redressal mechanisms.|
|**Consumer Protection (E-Commerce) Rules, 2020**|These mandatory rules **require sellers to take back defective or deficient goods,** withdraw services, or provide **refund**s if goods or services do not meet the **description on the platform**.|
|**Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI)**|A **self-regulatory organization** that monitors ads and deals with complaints against them in India.|

**Tags given to packaged foods:**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Tag**|**Description**|**Example**|
|**Natural**|A food product that is a **single food derived from a recognized natural source and has nothing added** to it. Packaging must be done **without chemicals and preservatives.**|Fresh fruits and vegetables|
|**Fresh**|The term “fresh” can only be used for food products that have been **washed, peeled, chilled, trimmed, or cut without any other processing** that alters its basic characteristics. If food is processed in any way to **extend its shelf life,** it cannot be labelled as “fresh.”|Freshly baked bread, freshly squeezed juice|
|**Pure**|“Pure” is to be used for **single-ingredient foods to which nothing has been added,** and the **unavoidable contaminants** are within **prescribed controls**.|Pure honey, pure maple syrup|
|**Original**|“Original” is used to describe food products made to a formulation, with a traceable origin that has **remained unchanged over time.**|Original recipe potato chips|
|**Nutritional Claims**|Nutritional claims in food advertisements can be about the **specific contents of a product or comparisons** with another food item.|“High in protein”, “Low in sugar”|

**Conclusion:**

To improve food safety in India, **companies should provide evidence to support their claims and modify advertisements** for better consumer understanding. FSSAI and state food authorities should **conduct surveys to ensure better enforcement and administration** of the FSS Act. Compensation and fines should **be increased in cases of injury or death**, and more food testing laboratories should be established.

### [25th anniversary of Pokhran-II](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/12/25th-anniversary-of-pokhran-ii/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Challenges to Internal Security/Indigenization of Technology**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/25th-anniversary-pokhran-ii-8604356/) 

**Context:** On May 11, 1998, codenamed **Operation Shakti** (literally, “strength”)/Pokhran-II, India conducted three nuclear bomb test explosions at the Indian Army’s Pokhran Test Range.

**Timeline of Operation Shakti/Pokhran-II:** 

**Foundation of India’s nuclear programme laid by physicist Homi J Bhaba:**

- **Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR):** India’s first research institution dedicated to the study of nuclear physics opened (1945) in Bombay, after Bhaba’s successful lobbying.
- **Department of Atomic Energy (DAE):** Founded in 1954 with Bhabha as director.

**The threat of China and Pakistan:**

- **The 1962 Sino-Indian War** and China’s subsequent nuclear bomb test at Lop Nor in 1964.
- **The 1965 India-Pakistan war**, with China openly supporting Pakistan.
- Therefore, India was surrounded by two unfriendly nations and needed to take steps towards building **self-sufficiency.**

**The “discriminatory” NPT:**

- **By the 1960s**, discourse around nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation as the Cold War arms race pushed the US and the USSR to great extremes.
- In 1968, the **Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)** came into existence, defining nuclear-weapon states as those that have built and tested a nuclear explosive device before January 1, 1967 – the US, Russia (formerly USSR), the UK, France and China.
- **This disallows any other state from acquiring nuclear weapons.**
- The government of India **refused to accede to the terms of the treaty** because it failed to address India’s concerns.

**Pokhran-I/Operation Smiling Buddha:**

- By the 1970s, **Vikram Sarabhai** (Bhaba’s successor at the DAE) had worked to significantly broaden India’s nuclear technology.
- **The Indira Gandhi government** showed political will and on May 18, 1974, India carried out its first nuclear test at the Pokhran test site.
- This test was conceptualised as a **“peaceful nuclear explosion” with “few military implications”.**

**International sanctions on India post-Pokhran-I:**

- The world was not willing to buy India’s version of the motive behind Pokhran-I and countries like the **US and Canada** imposed significant sanctions.
- These sanctions (majorly on tech transfer) would be a **major setback for India’s nuclear journey** and majorly decelerate its progress.

**The period between the two tests:**

- **Domestic political instability:** The Emergency of 1975 and PM Morarji Desai’s opposition to nuclear weapons brought the programme to a grinding halt.
- **1980s:** Dr APJ Abdul Kalam was made in charge of India’s missile programme (1983) and India exponentially increased its plutonium stockpiles.
- **1990S:**
    - **With the fall of the USSR in 1991**, India lost one of its biggest military allies.
    - The US continued to provide military aid to Pakistan.
    - Discussions regarding a **Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)** were also underway in the UN (it would be finalised in 1996, but India did not sign it).

**Pokhran-II – Projecting India’s strength:**

- **In 1995**, permission for carrying out a nuclear test was granted. However, logistical and political reasons pushed back the tests further.
- **In 1998**, the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government showed political will and successfully conducted **Operation Shakti**.
- Unlike the 1974 test, the Indian Government **declared itself as a state possessing nuclear weapons** following Pokhran-II.
- Though the test invited sanctions from some countries (like the US), **the condemnation was far less than in 1974**.
- **The test helped India enter the highly guarded club of countries** with the capability to deploy nuclear weapons, helping it to cement its status as a **dominant nation-state.**

**India’s nuclear doctrine (presented in 1999) since Pokhran-II:**

- It highlighted a **credible minimum deterrence (CMD) and a no-first-use (NFU)** policy, while concurrently supporting **non-proliferation and universal disarmament**.
- The sole purpose of India’s nuclear deterrence is **to deter adversaries’ use or threat of use of nuclear weapons.**
- **The policy changed India’s image** and the US (once an adversary of India’s nuclear programme) signed a civil nuclear deal with India in 2008, acknowledging India as a **responsible nuclear player.**

**Way ahead:**

- **India needs actions at two levels for sustainable national security:**
    - **To address immediate security threats** by intelligently building sufficient and resilient retaliatory capability to signal credible deterrence.
    - **To make long-term innovative diplomatic investments** towards the creation of a global environment conducive to peace and universal nuclear disarmament.
- Simultaneously, India can leverage the economic, political and cultural appeal to **showcase the advantages of its philosophy of nuclear deterrence**.

### [Ethical Issues with Remission](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/12/ethical-issues-with-remission/)

#### **GS Paper 4**

 **Syllabus:** Determinants and consequences of ethics in-human actions.

**Context:** The article argues that the recent remissions of **Anand Mohan Singh and the convicts in the Bilkis Bano case** are ethically wrong and politically motivated.

**About Remission:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Dimension**|**Description**|
|**Definition**|The complete ending of a sentence at a reduced point **without changing the nature of the sentence.**|
|**Purpose**|To provide prisoners with the **hope of release and encourage reformation**.|
|**Legal Basis**|Constitutional provisions under **Articles 72 and 161** and Statutory Power under Sections 432, 433, 433A, 434 and 435 of the CrPC.|
|**Eligibility**|Any person convicted of any offence, is **subject to certain conditions** and the **discretion** of the appropriate government.|
|**Conditions**|Breach of any condition will result in cancellation of remission and the need to serve the full sentence.|
|**Evaluation**|Each case must be considered on an individual basis, taking into account relevant factors.|
|**Fundamental Right**|The Supreme Court has clarified that **no convict has a fundamental right to remission,** but the state must give due consideration to every case of clemency.|
|**Remission vs Pardon**|Remission is the **reduction of a sentence** without changing its nature, while pardon is the **complete forgiveness of a sentence** and the removal of all legal consequences associated with it.|

**Ethical issues with remission:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Ethical Issues**|**Examples**|
|**Injustice to victims**|Remission of sentence for convicts in the **Bilkis Bano case** who were found guilty of raping and murdering multiple people, including a pregnant woman, during the 2002 Gujarat riots.|
|**Political interference**|Remission of sentence for **Anand Mohan Singh, a former MP and convicted criminal** who was involved in multiple cases of violence and murder. He was granted remission after his wife, also a former MP, appealed to the Chief Minister of Bihar.|
|**Lack of accountability**|Remission being granted **without proper evaluation of the convict’s behaviour** or reformation during the sentence.|
|**Discrimination based on social status**|Convicts from **privileged backgrounds being granted remission** more often than those from marginalized communities.|
|**Lack of transparency**|Lack of **clear guidelines or criteria for granting remission**, leading to inconsistency and possible favouritism.|
|**Disregard for the severity of the crime**|Remission being **granted for heinous crimes, such as murder or rape**, without proper consideration for the severity of the offense and its impact on the victim and their family.|

**Conclusion:**

Remission is an **important aspect of the criminal justice system** that allows for the reduction of a sentence for a prisoner. It should be **used judiciously** and with consideration of **principles of justice, mercy, and public safety**.

**Context:** The annual mean temperature of the world is known to have increased by 1.1 degree Celsius from the average of the 1850-1900 period. But this increase is not uniform. It varies in different regions and also at different times of the year.

**Major findings:**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Findings**|**Explanation**|   |
|**Land Temperature Increase**|Overland, the annual mean temperatures have risen by as much as **1.59 degrees Celsius** since preindustrial times.|   |
|**Ocean Temperature Increase**|Oceans, in contrast, have **warmed by about 0.88 degree Celsius**.|   |
|**Temperature Rise over India**|Annual mean temperatures over India had risen **by 0.7 degree Celsius** from 1900 while the global temperature rise has been **1.1 degrees** C.|   |
|**Reason for Lower Temperature Rise in India**|The relatively lower rise in temperatures over India can be attributed to a **complex set of atmospheric phenomena**, including **heat transfers from the tropics to the poles** through prevailing systems of air circulation.|[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/equetor.jpg?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/equetor.jpg)|
|**Impact of Aerosols**|**Aerosols scatter sunlight back** so that lesser heat is absorbed by the land.  **Aerosol concentration** in the **Indian region** is quite high. This could also **lower the warming effect.**|   |
|**Polar Region Warming**|The polar regions, particularly the Arctic, have seen significantly **greater warming than the world average.** The IPCC report says the Arctic region has warmed **at least twice as much** as the world average.|   |
|**Causes of Polar Region Warming**|Albedo effect, changes in clouds, water vapour and atmospheric temperatures.|   |

**Source: TH**

**Context:** The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared an **end to the global health emergency for mpox** after 10 months.

- WHO declared mpox as a public health emergency of international concern in July 2022 to combat the spread of the disease. The WHO recently also declared an end to the **public health emergency status for COVID-19**.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Topic**|Information|   |
|**What is Global Health Emergency?**|A global health emergency is a situation that **poses a serious threat** to public health on an international scale.|   |
|**Examples**|COVID-19 pandemic, the West African Ebola outbreak, and the Zika virus outbreak.|   |
|**Three Criteria for declaring**|1.      The spread is an”**Extraordinary Event**,”<br><br>2.      It “**Constitutes a Public Health Risk**” to other States through the international spread of disease<br><br>3.      It “**potentially requires a coordinated international response**.”|   |
|**About Mpox**|Mpox (previously known as monkeypox) is a rare disease caused by a virus.|   |
|**Origins and Nature**|First identified in **1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo** region|[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/congo.jpg?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/congo.jpg)|
|**Symptoms of Monkeypox**|Infected people break out in a **rash that looks like chickenpox**. Symptoms include fever, malaise, headache, and enlarged lymph glands|
|**Transmission of Monkeypox**|Primary infection is through **direct contact with the blood, bodily fluids**, or cutaneous or mucosal lesions of an infected animal. Eating inadequately **cooked meat of infected animals** is also a risk factor. **Human-to-human transmission can occur.**|   |
|**Vulnerability**|Mpox spreads rapidly and can cause **one out of ten deaths** if infected|   |
|**Treatment and Vaccine**|There is **no specific treatment or vaccine** available for Monkeypox infection, but the European Union has recommended the **Smallpox Vaccine**, Imvanex.|   |

### [Sludge to Fertilizer](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/12/sludge-to-fertilizer/)

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/first-study-on-indian-sludge-finds-high-potential-for-use-as-fertilizer/article66831657.ece)

**Context:** A recent study conducted by the **Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Roorkee** has found that the sludge from sewage treatment plants (STP) in India, which is rich in organic chemicals, has **“high potential”** for use as fertilizer.

**About sludge:**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Topic**|**Information**|   |
|**Definition**|Sludge is the **thick residue that remains after** the treatment of sewage or wastewater in a sewage treatment plant.|[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/sludge.jpg?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/sludge.jpg)|
|**Composition**|Sludge is rich in **organic chemicals**, heavy metals, industrial effluents and bacterial contaminants.|
|**Treatment**|The sludge needs to be **stored for at least three months to kill pathogens** and blended with cattle manure and husk or local soil to **reduce the heavy metal content.**|   |
|**Government Initiative**|National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCC) has launched “**Arth Ganga**” to monetise and reuse treated wastewater and sludge by converting it into usable products such as manure and bricks.|   |
|**Classification**|As per the **United States Environment Protection Agency standards**, treated sludge can be classified as **Class A and Class B**. India **does not yet** have such standards.|   |
|**Class A Vs Class B sludge**|Class A sludge can be **disposed of in the open** and used as organic fertilizer without any safety concerns.<br><br>On the other hand, **Class B** sludge can only be used in **restricted agricultural applications** where edible parts of the crop are not exposed to the sludge-mixed soil, and people or animals do not come into extensive contact.|   |

### [Mitochondrial Donation Treatment (MDT)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/12/mitochondrial-donation-treatment-mdt/)

**Source:** [**HT**](https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/threeparent-baby-born-in-uk-using-ivf-what-experts-have-to-say-101683805589417.html)

**Context:**  A baby has been born in the UK using a **technique called mitochondrial donation treatment (MDT) (popularly called ‘Three Parents Baby’)**, which involves using the DNA of three people in an effort to prevent children from inheriting incurable diseases.

**Working:**

The procedure combines the **sperm and eggs from the biological parents** with mitochondria from a donor’s eggs. Harmful **mutations** in **mitochondria**, which are inherited only from the mother, can affect all the children a woman has. As of now, the technique is still in its experimental stage.

|**Two-stage Explosion**|**First explosion** splits open the bomb’s fuel container, releasing a cloud of fuel and metal particles. **Second explosion** ignites the aerosol cloud, creating a giant ball of fire and sending out intense blast waves|
|**Prohibition**|Not prohibited by **any international law or agreement**|
|**Possible Action**|Use against civilian populations in built-up areas, schools or hospitals, could attract action under the **Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907**|

Myanmar has been facing violence since the military overthrew the elected government of **Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021** and brutally suppressed nonviolent protests.
