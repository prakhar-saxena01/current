### [Power to promulgate/re-promulgate ordinances](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/24/power-to-promulgate-re-promulgate-ordinances/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Structure, Organization and Functioning of the Executive**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/govts-power-to-promulgate-repromulgate-ordinances-why-how-8625383/)

**Context:** To overturn a unanimous decision of the SC’s Constitution Bench [which gave the [Delhi govt control over services in the NCT](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/13/delhi-government-case-vs-lg/)], the central government has issued an [Ordinance](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/04/23/insights-into-editorial-the-ordinance-route-is-bad-repromulgation-worse/).

**About the Ordinance:**

- It gave the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi **power over services.**
- It established a **National Capital Civil Service Authority.**
    - The authority will comprise the CM and two senior IAS officials.
    - It would decide matters by majority votes – which **may lead to a situation in which the view of the elected CM could be overruled.**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Ordinance**|   |
|**Meaning**|It is a law enacted by the Executive (President in the case of Union and Governor in the case of State) **to meet extraordinary/urgent circumstances.**|
|**Extraordinary/urgent circumstances**|**Article 123** of the Indian Constitution empowers the **President** [Article 213 – Governor] to promulgate Ordinances **during recess of Parliament.**|
|**Article 123**|If at any time, except when both Houses of Parliament are in session, the President is satisfied that **circumstances exist which render it necessary** for him to take immediate action, he may promulgate Ordinances.|
|**Real authority that decides to bring the Ordinance**|Under **Article 74**, the President acts on the advice of the Council of Ministers. Hence, it is in effect **the government that decides to bring the Ordinance.**|
|**Effect**|An Ordinance shall have the **same force and effect as an Act of Parliament**. However, the government is required to bring an Ordinance before Parliament for ratification.|
|**Life**|If the government  fails to get an Ordinance ratified by the Parliament, it will lapse at the **expiration of 6 weeks** from the reassembly of Parliament. Maximum life of an Ordinance = 6 months (recess) + 6 weeks<br><br>The Ordinance **may lapse earlier** – if the President withdraws it or if both Houses pass resolutions disapproving it (imply that the government has lost majority.)|
|**Criticism**|As lawmaking is a legislative function, Ordinance power is provided to meet urgent situations.<br><br>However, the governments adopt the Ordinance route to **bypass the legislature.**<br><br>**Repromulgation** of an Ordinance, which extends life of an Ordinance, allows the executive to further seize legislative power.|
|**SC verdicts on the issue**|**RC Cooper Case 1970:** If an Ordinance is issued solely to bypass the Parliament, the President’s decision to promulgate the Ordinance can be challenged.<br><br> **D C Wadhwa v. State of Bihar 1986:** If the Government ignores the legislature and repromulgate an Ordinance, it would be a colourable exercise of power.<br><br>**Krishna Kumar Singh v. State of Bihar 2017:** Reiterated that the Governor’s power to issue an Ordinance is in the nature of an **emergency power.** Repeated re-promulgations without bringing the Ordinance to the legislature would be **unconstitutional**.|

**Resorting to ordinances has always raised concern on violation of the spirit of separation of powers doctrine. While noting the rationales justifying the power to promulgate ordinances, analyze whether the decisions of the Supreme Court on the issue have further facilitated resorting to this power. Should the power to promulgate ordinances be repealed? (UPSC 2015)**

### [India@100: Resolving the tribal health challenge](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/24/india100-resolving-the-tribal-health-challenge/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Issues Relating to Development and Management of Social Sector/Services relating to Health**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/india75-looking-at-100-how-we-can-resolve-the-tribal-health-challenge-8625359/)

 **Context:** As India celebrates its achievements, it must build a healthcare system that caters to tribal communities.

**Since independence, India has made remarkable strides:**

- As the world’s **5th-largest economy** and a leader in the digital realm.
- **Demonstrating the ethos of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam** – One World, One Family.
    - **For example**, through its **Vaccine Maitri initiative**, India provided over 60 million vaccine doses to nations across the world.

**Challenges:**

- **Equitable, affordable and quality** healthcare for 4 billion people.
- Finding a way to achieve this without disrupting the identities of tribals.

**Healthcare issues faced by  Tribal communities in India:**

- They constitute **9% of the population** and remain the **most neglected and deprived group when it comes to access to healthcare**.
- For example, **the mortality rate in tribal areas is 44% higher than the national average**, and infant mortality is 63% higher [Ministry of Tribal Affairs].

**Reasons behind poor health indicators among tribals:** They face multifaceted challenges – lack of infrastructure, medical professionals, connectivity, affordability, equipment, insurance, funding, etc.

**Health schemes in tribal areas:**

- [**The National Health Mission (NHM)**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/08/09/launch-a-national-tribal-health-mission/)**:** It envisages the achievement of **universal access to equitable, affordable and quality healthcare services** that are accountable and responsive to people’s needs.
- **Various initiatives supported under the NHM for better healthcare in tribal areas:**
    - **Ayushman Bharat-Health and Wellness Centres** (HWCs) are established as part of the Ayushman Bharat programme.
    - **National Free Drugs Service Initiative and National Free Diagnostic Service Initiative** have been rolled out.
    - **The ASHA programme** provides for recruitment of ASHA at habitation level, in hilly, tribal and difficult areas.
    - **National Ambulances Services under NHM** for free transportation of sick patients to the health facilities.
    - All tribal majority districts whose composite health index is below the State average have been identified as **High Priority Districts** (HPDs)

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/tribal_area.png)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/tribal_area.png)

**Way ahead:**

- Urgent need to **empower** tribal communities and ensure they receive **equitable, affordable and accessible healthcare**.
    - This can be ensured by suitable **investments** (in medical colleges and training centres across such remote areas)**, public policy and governance.**
- Empowering tribal communities must be done **strategically**.
    - With a more **communitarian** social setup, an **underdeveloped economy** dependent on forest resources and **unique geographic conditions**, their health outcomes necessitate a unique approach.

**Best practices:**

- **Mera Baccha Abhiyan:**
    - It aims to fight malnutrition through **public participatio**n in Datia district, Madhya Pradesh.
    - As a result, the district witnessed a **drop in malnutrition rates (by 17.5%)**, **rise in immunisation, breastfeeding and a drop in diarrhoea.**
- **Piramal Swasthya – One of the largest implementing agencies of primary healthcare programmes in India:**
    - It has over a decade’s experience of **working with the tribal communities of Andhra Pradesh**, implementing its **unique community-based model**.
    - More recently, it has partnered with NITI Aayog to transform the health and nutrition systems in **25 Aspirational Districts** spread across 7 States of India.

**Conclusion:**

- As India moves towards **India@100**, the responsibility of providing healthcare (a fundamental human right) for all lies both with **private and government institutions**.
- Tribal communities can be empowered by inclusive leadership and investments in healthcare infrastructure, contributing to the UN SDGs.

### [G7: De-risking and Effective Climate Action](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/24/g7-de-risking-and-effective-climate-action/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **International Relations**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/g7-talks-about-de-risking-in-reference-to-china-what-does-this-mean-8623161/#:~:text=In%20the%20G7%20statement%2C%20the,not%20decoupling%20or%20turning%20inwards.) 

**Context:** The 49th annual summit (Hiroshima, Japan) of the [G7](https://www.insightsonindia.com/international-relations/important-international-institutions-agencies-and-further-structure-mandate-etc/g7/) leaders concluded recently.

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/g7.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/g7.png)**

**Highlights of the summit:**

- G7 countries said that they would **build economic resilience** for themselves, based on a strategy of **diversifying and deepening partnerships and de-risking, not decoupling**.
- G7 acknowledged the urgency for effective climate action but offered little in terms of scaled-up action.

**What does de-risking and decoupling mean?**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**De-risking**|**Decoupling**|
|To **move business away from areas** that are considered risky in terms of the returns they could generate.|It is used as an alternative to an economic boycott **to reduce correlation between markets.**|
|To have **resilient, effective supply chains** to prevent coercion of any other country.||

**Why was ‘de-risking’ used by G7 countries?** To describe their stance towards China on economic matters.

**De-risking in the context of China:** It can be **interpreted as a reduction of the reliance on China** in the economic sphere – for the supply of materials or as a market for finished goods, so that potential risks to trade and disruption of supply chains are reduced.

### [Making Cities Climate-Ready](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/24/making-cities-climate-ready/)

#### **GS3/GS2**

 **Syllabus****:  Environment/ Governance**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/climate-change/making-cities-climate-ready-crucial-to-solving-climate-crisis-world-bank-89503)

 **Context:** A recent report by the World Bank titled **“Thriving: Making Cities Green, Resilient, and Inclusive in a Changing Climate”** provides guidance to local and national policymakers on how to create greener, more resilient, and inclusive cities.

**Status of Cities in terms of their greenness, resilience, and inclusiveness (as per the report):**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Aspect**|**Findings**|**Example**|
|**Greenness**|Cities in **high- and upper-middle-income** countries contribute significantly to global greenhouse gas emissions.|Cities in North America are among the **largest per capita emitters of greenhouse gases**.|
|**Resilience**|Cities in low- and lower-middle-income countries face the **highest exposure to climate change-related hazards**.|Cities in **Bangladesh and India** are more vulnerable to floods, heat stress, and cyclones, resulting in severe economic consequences.|
|**Inclusiveness**|**Lack of inclusiveness contributes** to the **vulnerability and lack of resilience** in cities of low- and lower-middle-income countries.|Cities in **low- and lower-middle-income countries** often struggle with inadequate access to healthcare, education, and essential utilities such as water and electricity.|
|**Air Pollution**|Cities in low- and middle-income countries have **higher levels of air pollution, particularly PM2.5**, compared to cities in high-income countries.|**Delhi, Kanpur, Patna** etc. have experienced high levels of PM2.5, especially during the winter season|
|**Vertical Development and Prosperity**|Cities that develop vertically consume less land, accommodate more people, and show increased prosperity.|**New York City**, have **higher population density and economic activity** compared to cities with sprawled development.|
|**Lack of Vegetation and Heat Impact**|Cities with less vegetation, particularly in **upper-middle-income countries**, experience exacerbated impacts from extreme heat events and urban heat island effects.|Cities like **Tokyo**, with limited green spaces, **face higher temperatures during heat waves** due to the lack of vegetation and increased heat retention.|

**Five sets of instruments to improve the greenness, resilience, and inclusiveness of cities (as recommended by the report):**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**5 I’s**|**Description**|**Example**|
|**Information**|Policies and measures to provide **credible and timely information** to individuals, businesses, and local governments **about climate change risks,** mitigation and adaptation measures|Establishing a **climate change information centre** to provide climate risks data specific to their city.|
|**Incentives**|It includes **removing subsidies that encourage activities with negative environmental externalities,** Implementing tax incentives or rebates for installing energy-efficient technologies|[FAME](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/24/mission-2023-insights-daily-current-affairs-pib-summary-24-may-2023/o) I and II scheme, EU’s [**Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/09/eus-carbon-border-tax-2/)|
|**Insurance**|Developing **climate risk insurance schemes that provide coverage for businesses and households** against losses from extreme weather events, encouraging investment in climate-resilient infrastructure and enabling quick recovery.|   |
|**Integration**|Policy interventions promoting **compact cities and better integration between urban and rural areas;** Developing **efficient public transportation networks** that connect urban and rural areas|E.g., [Smart City mission](https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/welfare-schemes/schemes-under-ministry-of-housing-and-urban-affairs/smart-cities-mission-scm/), **PURA Scheme** (provide urban amenities and livelihood opportunities in rural areas)|
|**Investments**|Investments by **national and local governments in green, resilient, and inclusive urban infrastructure**. This includes **nature-based solutions and measures** to attract private-sector finance for sustainable development.|Allocating funds for the **construction of green buildings, renewable energy projects, and urban parks**.|

**Conclusion:**

Addressing the challenges of **climate change and creating sustainable cities** requires a multi-faceted approach. It involves prioritizing green practices, building resilience to climate impacts, and promoting inclusiveness in urban development. Taking action at the city level is crucial in mitigating climate change and ensuring a sustainable future for generations to come.

**Definitions**:

**Greenness**: Greenness refers to **the environmental sustainability and ecological balance** of a city.

 **Resilience**: Resilience refers to the **ability of a city to withstand and recover from shocks**, stresses, and climate change impacts.

 **Inclusiveness**: Inclusiveness refers to **creating cities that are socially and economically equitable,** where all individuals and communities have equal access to opportunities, resources, and services.

### [Decentralised renewable energy (DRE) technologies](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/24/decentralised-renewable-energy-dre-technologies/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Science and Technology- Developments and their Applications and Effects in Everyday Life**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/energy/decentralised-clean-energy-tech-can-impact-37-mn-livelihoods-in-india-s-agri-textile-sectors-study-89516)

 **Context:** According to a new report, technologies that are powered by DRE could potentially impact 37 million livelihoods in India’s agriculture and textile sectors.

**DRE:** Energy that is **generated close to where it will be used** and typically uses renewable energy sources, including small hydro, combined heat and power (CHP), biomass, solar and wind power.

**DRE technologies include:** Solar-run textile manufacturing units, biomass-powered cold solar storages and micro solar pumps, etc.

**Current status in India:**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DRE.jpg?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DRE.jpg)

- India has **12 mature technologies** powered by DRE.
- There are **5.5 lakh installations** of these 12 technologies, with an estimated **livelihood impact of 5.6 lakh people.**

**Potential:**

- DRE has a market potential of **Rs 4 lakh crore in rural and peri-urban communities** in India and can impact 37 million livelihoods.
- **Solar-powered technologies** have the maximum potential to be deployed (**UP** leads in terms of estimated future adoption).
- **Solar pumps** are the most mature technologies due to the government subsidies provided.

**Positive impacts of using DRE technologies:**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/economic_imopact.jpg?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/economic_imopact.jpg)

 **Barriers to DRE tech adoption:**

- **The commercial viability** of such solutions, which are **capital intensive** in nature.
- One barrier faced by the users is the **lack of direct contact with the manufacturers** to address technology defects.

**Way ahead:**

- **Assessment of demand:** It will help in mapping the needs of beneficiaries with appropriate fit to DRE livelihood applications.
- **R&D and standardisation:** To offer tailor-made solutions important for their widespread adoption.
- **Pilot and up-scaling:** It is vital to ascertain the success of any technology innovation on the ground.
- **Access to finance:**
    - Introducing long-period, low-interest loans to users to enable ease of adoption of such solutions.
    - **State Rural Livelihoods Missions** (SRLMs) can leverage their existing institutional setup to provide financial support for the women SHG members.
- **Skill development and capacity building:**
    - This has the potential of creating new local job opportunities in operations, maintenance and installation/fabrication.
    - Linkages will be established in existing government schemes like **MUDRA to support micro-entrepreneurship** in the value chain for DRE livelihood applications.
- **Public information and awareness**

### [‘Forum Shopping’](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/24/forum-shopping/)

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/cji-chandrachud-forum-shopping-sc-8624879/)

 **Context:** Recently, CJI Chandrachud has condemned **‘forum shopping’.**

Forum shopping refers to the **practice of litigants or lawyers deliberately** selecting a particular **judge or court** where they believe the judgment will be **more favourable to their case**. This practice involves choosing a court that is likely to provide the **most favourable outcome,** rather than following the standard legal process.

**Issues with Forum Shopping:**

- It circumvents the **normal course of justice** and can lead to an **imbalance in the workload** of courts.
- The Supreme Court has condemned this practice. It has **no sanction in law** and must be discouraged.
- **Ethical issues**: Unfair advantage; Manipulation of the legal system

**Recourse available with courts in case of ‘forum Shopping’:**

- Courts may **exercise discretionary powers and refuse jurisdiction** over a matter if another court or forum is more suitable. This ensures that cases are allocated to the appropriate bench and promotes fairness and justice.
- Courts can impose fines on litigants

 **Context:** The government has granted approvals for an **international container port** on the **Great Nicobar Island**, which poses a threat to the survival of **leatherback turtles**, the largest turtles on Earth.

**Threats faced by turtles:** Turtles face threats such as loss of nesting sites, fishing activities, boat collisions, egg collection, plastic waste ingestion, and habitat destruction.

The approvals granted for the project have been **criticized for their violation of internationally accepted principles** of biodiversity offsetting. There is **no provision to compensate** for the damage to turtle nesting.

**About the turtle**

The **Giant Leatherback turtle (IUCN: Vulnerable) is the largest of the seven sea turtle** species. It has a leather-like shell and is found in all oceans except the Arctic and the Antarctic. In the Indian Ocean, it nests only in **Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.** It is the only **living species** in its genus and family. The Leatherback is unique among reptiles as it **can generate heat to maintain high body temperatures**. It is protected under **India’s Wildlife Protection Act**. Female Leatherbacks **nest in significant numbers in the Andaman and Nicobar Island**s and then swim towards Australia’s western coast and the eastern coast of Africa.
