### [Global Slavery Index 2023](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/31/global-slavery-index-2023/)

#### **GS Paper 1/2**

 **Syllabus:** **Indian society/Mechanisms, Laws, Institutions and Bodies constituted for the Protection and Betterment of these Vulnerable Sections**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/g20-countries-including-india-are-fuelling-modern-slavery-says-new-report/article66895654.ece#:~:text=The%20Global%20Slavery%20Index%202023,people%20living%20in%20'modern%20slavery'&text=50%20million%20people%20are%20living,years%2C%20says%20a%20new%20report.)

**Context:** According to the Walk Free Foundation’s Global Slavery Index 2023, **50 million people are living in conditions of** [modern slavery](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/09/14/modern-slavery/) – a 25% rise over the last five years.

**Modern slavery:**

- It refers to situations of exploitation in that **a person cannot refuse or leave** because of threats, violence, coercion, or deception.
- It manifests as **forced labour, child labour, forced marriage**, debt bondage, commercial sexual exploitation, human trafficking, etc.

**The Global Slavery Index:**

- It is **an assessment of modern slavery conditions** in 160 countries.
- It uses data released by the **International Labour Organisation (ILO), the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), etc**.
- The Index provides rankings across **3 dimensions**: Size of the problem (prevalence), Government response and Vulnerability (political instability, inequality).
- The 2023 index is significant as [India holds the G20 presidency](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/07/editorial-analysis-indias-g20-presidency/) **this year**, with a focus on **sustainable development and climate change mitigation**.

**Highlights of the Global Slavery Index 2023:**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/most_prevelent.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/most_prevelent.png)

- **50 million people** were living in conditions of modern slavery on any given day in 2021.
- The practice has become **more prevalent over the last five years** (a 25%/10 million rise), due to **climate change, armed conflict, weak governance and COVID-19**.
- **G20 nations** account for more than half of all people living in modern slavery because their trade operations and global supply chains allow for human rights abuses.

**The situation within G20 nations: India** tops the list with 11 million people working as forced labourers, followed by China, Russia, Indonesia, Turkey and the U.S.

**Challenges:**

- **SDG 8.7 [ending forced labour and modern slavery]:** High prevalence of modern slavery and stagnating government action highlight the difficulty in achieving this goal by 2030.
- **Sectors of the economy promote modern slavery:** Like the textile industry promotes conditions of forced and unpaid work, lack of benefits (maternity leave), etc.
- **Poor govt policies:** For example, the “Sumangali” scheme in Tamil Nadu traps women and girls from marginalised locations to work in exploitative conditions in spinning mills.

**Way ahead:**

- **South-south cooperation** to bring more transparency in value chains, social security for workers at all stages, and holding corporations accountable in multilateral and bilateral free trade agreements.
- **Implementing stronger measures and legislations** that prevent governments and businesses from sourcing goods and services linked to modern slavery.
- **Embedding anti-slavery measures in climate change sustainability plans**.
- Providing primary and secondary education to children and tightening regulations around forced and child marriage.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Case of India**|   |
|**Vulnerable population**|**Indigenous communities** and those engaged in fishing and agriculture in States like Odisha and West Bengal have become victims of debt bondage, human trafficking and mass displacement.|
|**India’s Stance on modern slavery**|The Bonded Labour Abolition Act 1976.<br><br>A Central Scheme for Rehabilitation of Bonded Labour.<br><br>According to the SC, non-payment of minimum wages amounts to “forced labour” under **Article 23 of the Constitution.**|
|**Challenges**|**Poor implementation of laws** due to corruption, apathy, legal loopholes and lack of political will.<br><br>**India’s new Labour Codes** (which are yet to be implemented) may give “legal sanction” to forced labour by extending work hours and diluting the social security of people working in the organised and unorganised sectors.<br><br>**No data on people stuck in modern slavery:** India’s last national survey of bonded labour was done in the mid-90s.|
|**Best practice**|States like **Tamil Nadu** have initiated plans to conduct a survey;|

**Conclusion:**

- Strong legislation and accountability of G20 nations must be ensured to empower vulnerable communities.
- The road to preventing forced labour goes through the **right of access to public goods,** **global commons and decent work**.

### [Direct-seeding method gains currency in India’s paddy-growing regions](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/31/direct-seeding-method-gains-currency-in-indias-paddy-growing-regions/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus: Agriculture**

**Source:** [Hindu Business Line](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/agri-business/direct-seeding-method-gains-currency-in-indias-paddy-growing-regions/article66908422.ece)

 **Context**: There is a growing trend of **farmers in rice-growing states of India** adopting the [direct-seeding method](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/05/10/direct-seeding-of-rice-2/) for paddy cultivation.

**Reasons**: With delays in rainfall and labour shortages, this method allows farmers to sow seeds without waiting for rain or spending time in nurseries.

**What is Direct Seeded Rice (DSR)?**

[DSR](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/06/09/direct-seeding-of-rice/#:~:text=What%20is%20Direct%20Seeding%20of,give%20one%20pre%2Dsowing%20irrigation.), also known as the **‘broadcasting seed technique**,’ is a method in which **seeds are directly drilled into the fields**. There is **no nursery preparation** or transplantation involved in this method.

**Technique**:

In this technique, farmers **level the land, provide one pre-sowing irrigation**, and then sow the rice seeds **directly into the field** instead of transplanting seedlings.

**Advantages of DSR over Traditional Agriculture:**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Advantages**|**Direct Seeding Method (DSR)**|**Traditional Agriculture**|
|**Water Conservation**|Direct-seeding method reduces water requirement by **about 15%.**|Relies heavily on flood irrigation, leading to water wastage|
|**Labour Efficiency**|Requires fewer labourers for nursery preparation and transplantation|Requires a significant workforce for nursery and transplanting|
|**Time Savings**|Eliminates the need for nursery preparation and transplanting time|Requires time for nursery preparation and transplanting|
|**Yield Potential**|Can result in higher yields due to improved crop management|Yield may vary based on crop management and environmental factors|
|**Soil Health**|Helps prevent the development of hard crust beneath the plough layer|Puddling can lead to soil compaction and reduced soil health|
|**Crop Residue Management**|Allows for better management of crop residue|Crop residue management can be challenging in traditional methods|

**Limitations of DSR:** 

- **Weed Management Challenges**: DSR often requires **multiple sprays of weedicides** to control weed growth. In comparison, **flood irrigation in the traditional method** acts as a natural weedicide.
- **Vulnerability to Climate Extremes**: DSR may be more susceptible to extreme weather conditions, such as high temperatures and deficient rainfall.
- **Crop Residue Management**: Unlike traditional agriculture, where rice straw is removed after harvest, DSR leaves the crop residue in the field.
- **Variability in Yield:** The success of DSR can vary depending on factors like farmer expertise, soil type, and environmental conditions.
- **Initial Learning Curve**: Transitioning from traditional agriculture to DSR may require farmers to acquire new knowledge and skills.

- The **seed requirement for DSR is** also higher than transplanting.
-  **Land levelling is compulsory** in DSR, therefore, increasing the cost.

### [GM food and sustainable food production](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/31/gm-food-and-sustainable-food-production/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Awareness in the fields of Biotechnology**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/gm-food-the-best-way-for-sustainable-food-production-8633727/)

 **Context:** [Genetically modified (GM) food](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/21/sansad-tv-genetic-modification-in-crops/) is viewed as a controversial as well as a science-based solution for a sustainable global food system.

**Challenges the world is facing – Conflict between** [food security](https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-economy-3/agriculture/food-security-in-india/) **and environmental protection**:

- **Agriculture** is responsible for **a quarter of the carbon emissions** and the vast majority of the **world’s biodiversity losses**.
- However, **there is the need to increase food production** (by 50%), as the world’s population keeps growing [will reach 10 billion in 2057 (as per UN estimates)].

**Approaches to achieving food security and mitigating** [climate crisis](https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/climate-change-and-associated-issues/)**:**

- **Dietary changes** to make consumption more sustainable.
- **Better technologies** to create more environmentally friendly methods of agriculture. **Gene technologies** are a crucial part of the strategy for a sustainable food system.

**What is GM food?**

- **Genetically modified organisms** (GMOs) are organisms that have altered DNA to change their properties.
- Foods produced from or using GMOs are often referred to as GM foods/crops.
- **GMOs were first introduced in the US in 1994**, to prolong the shelf life of tomato plants.
- Since then, GM **soybeans, wheat and rice** have been approved for agricultural use.
- Currently, GM crop production uses **~10% of the land** as compared to non-GM crops.

**Advantages:**

- **Can improve** yield, delay ripening to prolong their shelf life, builds resistance to disease/pests, frost, or drought, or adds nutrients.
- **Can be modified to reduce carbon emissions** and boost the sustainability of food production.

**GM controversy:**

- **Uncertainty** (over-regulation) and **concerns about safety** (long-term impact on human-animal health and biodiversity).
- **The monopoly of big corporations** (like Monsanto) → expensive GM seeds.

**GM crops in India:**

- Indian farmers started cultivating **Bt cotton** – a pest-resistant, GM version of cotton, in 2002-03.
    - **By 2014, around 96%** of the area under cotton cultivation in India was Bt cotton, making India the **4th-largest cultivator of GM crops by acreage** and the 2nd largest producer of cotton.
- **The Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) cleared** the environmental release of [mustard hybrid Dhara Mustard Hybrid (DMH-11)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/11/29/whats-the-hurry-for-gm-mustard/) for its seed production and testing
- Indian scientists have also developed **strains of Sub-1 rice**, which are much more resistant to flooding.
- [Golden rice](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/02/23/why-bangladesh-sees-golden-rice-as-a-threat/) is a GM strain modified to contain **vitamin A**, to combat the shortage of dietary vitamin A in parts of Asia and Africa.

**Way ahead:**

- The focus of [GM products](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/11/14/editorial-analysis-the-gene-revolution/) must be on the **social and public enterprise.**
- The industry must look at **more local solutions** that help smallholder farmers in developing countries.
- Easy availability of **open-source seeds and GM technologies**.
- **Creating a licensing landscape** that empowers local farmers to adapt to the demands of [sustainable agriculture](https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-economy-3/inclusive-growth-and-issues-arising-from-it/recent-actions-taken-to-usher-inclusive-growth-in-the-economy-in-the-below-domains/sustainable-and-inclusive-agricultural-growth/), to meet rising populations and climate change.

### [Insurgency in Manipur](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/31/insurgency-in-manipur/)

####  **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Linkages between Development and Spread of Extremism**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/dozens-of-groups-deep-faultlines-history-of-insurgeny-in-manipur-8635597/)

 **Context:** Amid fresh [violence in Manipur](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/05/issues-in-manipur/), the [Kuki](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/15/what-is-the-soo-agreement-with-tribal-insurgent-groups-that-the-manipur-govt-withdrew-from/) National Organisation (KNO) has countered the claims of the Manipur CM that 40 insurgents had been killed by security forces.

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/district.jpg?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/district.jpg)**

**How did violent clashes start?**

- **Violence erupted in the Kuki-dominated** Churachandpur district, where members of the Kuki tribe were protesting against the Meitei community’s demands to be designated as a “Scheduled Tribe”.
- The tribes believe granting [ST status to the Meiteis](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/10/power-to-direct-changes-in-sts-list/) **would be an infringement of their rights** as they claim to be the marginalised part of the population.

**History of conflict in Manipur:** Manipur has been in the **cross-currents of India’s oldest** **insurgent movement** – The Naga national movement in the 1950s.

**The Valley insurgent groups:**

- **In 1964**, the United National Liberation Front (UNLF) was formed, demanding secession from India.
- Subsequently, **numerous Meitei insurgent groups** (PREPAK, PLA) came into being, which received arms and training from China.
- These groups operated with a dual purpose – i**ndependence from India, and warding off Naga insurgent groups.**

**The Kuki-Zomi insurgent groups:**

- It started as a defence against aggression by other groups, **but quickly turned to a call for** [Kukiland](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/03/05/insights-into-editorial-the-history-of-the-kuki-insurgency-in-manipur/) – an imagined country spreading across the Kuki-Zomi inhabited areas of India, Myanmar and Bangladesh.
- Over time, **this was diluted to simply a call for a separate state**.

**Government reaction:**

- The [Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) 1958](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/04/29/armed-forces-special-powers-act-afspa-7/) was enacted and **extended to the entire state.**
- In the **1980s, Manipur was declared a disturbed area**.
- A tripartite [**Suspension of Operation (SoO)**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/15/what-is-the-soo-agreement-with-tribal-insurgent-groups-that-the-manipur-govt-withdrew-from/) agreement between the Centre, the state and the Kuki-Zomi groups was signed in **2008**.
- As the law-and-order situation gradually improved, **AFSPA has been repealed in several areas.**
- However, **the Valley insurgent groups** (like the UNLF, which is considered the mother of all Meitei insurgent groups) **have never entered an agreement** with the Centre**.**

**Insurgent groups in society and politics:**

- The insurgent groups are **intricately woven into daily life in Manipur**.
    - They conduct **strikes, and impose moral codes** such as a ban on Hindi movies and music, etc.
    - The groups also levy **‘taxes’** on the public.
- The groups are most visible today in the political life of the state. Candidates, cutting across party lines, stand for **elections with insurgent backing, and the groups dictate to the voters who should win.**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/einstein-gravitational-waves-feynman-thought-experiment/article66900109.ece)

Physicists once doubted the existence of **gravitational waves until Richard Feynman** (an American theoretical physicist) settled the debate with a thought experiment.

Albert Einstein had discovered the theory of **general relativity in 1915,** including the existence of gravitational waves, but he was sceptical. The debate continued for decades until Feynman (in 1957) proposed a simple **thought experiment that demonstrated how** [**gravitational waves**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/08/ligo-india/#:~:text=What%20are%20Gravitational%20Waves%3F,or%20collide%20with%20each%20other) could transfer energy, resolving the confusion. Feynman’s argument convinced many physicists, inspiring further research on gravitational waves. In 2016, scientists finally announced the **first direct detection of** [**gravitational waves**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/08/ligo-india/#:~:text=What%20are%20Gravitational%20Waves%3F,or%20collide%20with%20each%20other), a significant achievement made possible in part by Feynman’s influential contribution.

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source: IE**

 **Context:** The recent ruling by the Supreme Court states that when the government enters into a contract under the President’s name, it **cannot claim immunity from the legal provisions of that contract under Article 299 of the Constitution.**

**About the case:** 

The case involved **Glock Asia-Pacific Limited, a pistol manufacturing company**, and the Centre (government). Glock had a **contract with the Ministry of Home Affairs** to supply pistols, but a dispute arose when the government invoked a **performance bank guarantee**. **Glock invoked arbitration**, but the government challenged the appointment of the arbitrator based on a tender condition.

The Supreme **Court decided in favour of Glock**, stating that the arbitration clause allowing a government officer as an arbitrator conflicted with the law. The court appointed a retired Supreme Court judge as the arbitrator to resolve the dispute.

 **Context**: Recently, the **Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor** raised red flags over **banks adopting innovative methods for evergreening of loans** – covering up the real status of stressed loans of corporates.

**About Evergreening of loans:**

- Evergreening of loans refers to a **practice where banks or lenders provide additional funds or take other measures to artificially sustain a loan** that is not being repaid as scheduled.
- It is a **temporary solution used by banks to avoid classifying the loan as** [a non-performing asset (NPA)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/10/12/why-npas-are-not-just-about-bank-governance/#:~:text=What%20are%20NPAs%3A%20A%20non,a%20period%20of%2090%20days.) because such classification would **require them to set aside more money for potential losses, which could affect their profitability.**

**Methods used by banks for Evergreening of loans:**

- Bringing **two lenders together to evergreen each other’s loans**.
- **Good borrowers are being persuaded to enter into structured deals with stressed borrowers**.

**Facts For Prelims:**

**Source:** [Indian Express](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/what-is-rbi-planned-lightweight-payments-system-for-emergencies-8637007/#:~:text=The%20Reserve%20Bank%20of%20India%20%28RBI%29%20has%20conceptualised,in%20exigencies%20such%20as%20natural%20calamities%20or%20war.)

**Context:** The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has conceptualised a **lightweight payment and settlements system**, which can be **operated from anywhere by a bare minimum staff** in exigencies such as **natural calamities or war.**

- The infrastructure for this system will be **independent of the technologies that underlie the existing systems of payments such as UPI, NEFT, and RTGS.**

**Difference between** [UPI](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/05/the-unified-payments-interface-upi/) **and lightweight system:**

- The key difference lies in the **resilience and availability of the two systems.**
- UPI and other conventional systems prioritize **handling large transaction volumes and require a stable and robust infrastructure**.
- On the other hand, the lightweight system is designed **to operate even in volatile and extreme conditions when regular payment systems may not be accessible.**

**Benefits:**

- Such a system could ensure near-**zero downtime of the payment and settlement system** in the country and **keep the liquidity pipeline of the economy alive** and intact by facilitating the uninterrupted functioning of essential payments.
- By implementing a lightweight system as a backup, the RBI aims to ensure that individuals and institutions can **continue to make payments during emergencies or disruptions to the conventional payment infrastructure**.
- It serves as a **precautionary measure to be prepared for extreme situations and maintain the continuity of financial transactions.**
