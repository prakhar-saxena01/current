### [Erosion of the traditional Indian family](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/18/erosion-of-the-traditional-indian-family/)

#### **GS1/GS4 Paper** 

 **Syllabus: Indian Society: Family System/ Ethics**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-the-erosion-of-the-traditional-indian-family-is-worrying-8610424/)

 **Context:** The article highlights the increasing cases of violence within families, suicides among young individuals, and the rising number of children involved in criminal activities as **symptoms of societal ill-health and disruptions in the traditional family system**.

**What is a family?** 

A family is a **social unit consisting of individuals** who are related by blood, marriage, or adoption. It is a **fundamental institution in society** where members provide support, love, and care for one another, and **share common experiences, values, and responsibilities**.

**What is the meaning of a traditional Indian family?**

The traditional Indian family refers to the **prevailing family structure and dynamics** that have been **historically and culturally** prevalent in Indian society. It **typically** follows a **patriarchal system** where the **father or eldest male member** holds authority and decision-making power within the family.

**Importance of family:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
||**Example**|
|**Emotional Support**|During challenging times, such as the loss of a loved one or personal struggles|
|**Socialization**|Family plays a vital role in socializing children, teaching them societal norms, values, and behaviours|
|**Identity Formation**|Family provides a sense of belonging and helps individuals develop their identity by instilling **cultural, religious, and familial values.**|
|**Intergenerational Bonding**|The presence of **multiple generations in a family fosters intergenerational relationships**, creating opportunities for shared wisdom, experiences, and mutual learning.|
|**Moral and Ethical Development**|Families teach principles of honesty, integrity, compassion, and responsibility.<br><br>India swear by **Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam**. Kutumb or family has **traditionally acquired primacy in human interpersonal-social relationship** dynamics.|
|**Education Guidance and Financial Support**|   |

**Challenges faced by the traditional family system:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
||**Example**|
|**Changing Gender Roles**|For instance, if a **woman desires a career outside the home** but is expected to prioritize domestic responsibilities, conflicts may arise.|
|**Generational Gap**|When younger members **adopt different values, lifestyles, and beliefs** than their older relatives.|
|**Urbanization and Mobility**|As individuals seek better opportunities or education, they may move away from their extended families, leading to a **decrease in close-knit family support** networks.|
|**Influence of Technology**|Technology can impact traditional family dynamics, with **increased screen time and virtual interactions** potentially diminishing the **sense of togetherness** within the family.|
|**Excessive emphasis on Individualism**|For example, **candid and heart-to-heart dialogues** between husband-wife and parent-children are becoming rare. They have become **too formal and superficial**. This challenges the **collectivist nature** of traditional family systems.|
|**Excessive Formalisation**|From birthdays to weddings and house-warmings to condolence meetings, everything is being made into a formal event. This creates the **“crisis of authenticity”** of our interpersonal feelings.|
|**Cultural and Social Changes**|Cultural and social changes, such as **globalization and exposure to diverse perspectives**, can challenge traditional family norms and values.|
|**Balancing Work and Family**|The traditional family system may face difficulties in **accommodating individual aspirations** while maintaining traditional family roles and responsibilities.|

**Ways of Reviving India’s Traditional Family System:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
||**Example**|
|**Promote Inter-generational Bonding**|Using storytelling, family meals, and cultural celebrations.|
|**Strengthen Communication and Dialogue**|Promote dialogue that goes beyond **formalities** and **embraces deeper emotional connections.**|
|**Value Traditional Values and Customs**|Encourage the **preservation of traditional values, customs, and cultural practices** within the family, ensuring that they are passed down to younger generations.|
|**Foster Mutual Support and Care**|E.g., provide emotional support during challenging times and engage in acts of kindness and assistance.|
|**Balance Individualism and Collectivism**|E.g., Encourage family members to pursue personal goals while maintaining a sense of togetherness, shared decision-making, and a commitment to the welfare of the family unit.|
|**Embrace Modern Technology Responsibly**|E.g., Encouraging the use of technology for **virtual family gatherings,** sharing updates, and staying connected across distances.|
|**Promote Gender Equality and Empowerment**|Advocate for gender equality within the family, promoting shared responsibilities, equal opportunities, and empowering women to pursue their aspirations.<br><br>**Woman-led, child-focused and elderly-sensitive** families are the need of the hour|

**Conclusion:**

 The traditional Indian family system holds **immense value and significance** in providing emotional support, socialization, identity formation, and a sense of belonging. **Reviving and nurturing the traditional family system** can contribute to the well-being of individuals, the cohesion of society, and the preservation of cultural heritage.

### [Making agri-commodity value chains sustainable](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/18/making-agri-commodity-value-chains-sustainable/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus: Indian Agriculture**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/agricultural-commodity-value-chains-sustainable-climate-change/article66853378.ece)

**Context:** The article highlights the challenges associated with making agricultural commodity value chains sustainable. It identifies four dimensions that make mitigating environmental impacts a difficult task

**Meaning of agri-commodity value chains:**

 Agri-commodity value chains refer to the entire process of production, processing, distribution, and consumption of agricultural commodities, **from farm to fork**.

**“Making Agri-commodity value chains sustainable”** means the practice of ensuring that the **agricultural value chain minimizes negative environmental** and social impacts while promoting long-term economic viability.

**Need of making agri-commodity value chains sustainable:**

Making agri-commodity value chains sustainable is essential to **protect the environment, ensure long-term agricultural productivity, meet consumer demands,** address global sustainability challenges, promote stakeholder accountability, and adapt to the impacts of climate change.

**The challenges of ensuring sustainability in agricultural commodity value chains:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Challenges**|**Examples**|
|**Market and producer Related**|E.g., uncertain Export policies; adverse WTO norms influencing Indian farmers; uncertain MSP by the government|
|**Production related**|The production process, including land-use strategies, seed quality, and input usage, varies across different commodities. Lack of specific intervention by farmers suited to the specific production systems, such as intensive or extensive agriculture or agroforestry, leads to low yield.|
|**Weak policies**|Weak governance mechanisms, subsidies, market access, and infrastructural support for Indian agriculture|
|**Marginalized farmers**|Poor Working conditions for marginalized tenants, almost no labour rights, and inequity for Indian farmers|

**Few Government Initiatives for sustainable agriculture:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Scheme**|**Objective**|
|**Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana**|Promote organic farming|
|**National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA)**|Promote climate-resilient and sustainable agricultural practices such as conservation agriculture, agroforestry, integrated farming systems, etc.|
|**Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana**|Improve water use efficiency in agriculture|
|**Soil Health Card Scheme**|Encourage balanced and judicious use of fertilizers|
|**National Mission on Oilseeds and Oil Palm (NMOOP)**|Promote sustainable production of oilseeds and oil palm|
|**National Agricultural Market (e-NAM)**|Create a unified national market for agricultural commodities|
|**Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana (PMKSY)**|Develop agri-processing clusters and infrastructure to increase value addition and reduce post-harvest losses|

**What should be done:**

The production process, including **land-use strategies and inputs, varies across commodities**, requiring tailored interventions. **Strong governance mechanisms and policies**, including subsidies and regulations, can support sustainable value chains. Additionally, an **inclusive approach is necessary**, considering working conditions, labour rights, equity, and the effects of the climate crisis on production.

**Conclusion:**

There is a need to address the environmental, social, and economic dimensions of sustainability in the context of agricultural production, processing, and distribution.

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus: Science and Technology: Health**

**Source: WHO**

 **Context**: The new WHO report (**Incentivising the Development of new antibacterial treatments 2023**) highlights progress in addressing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) but also identifies gaps in ensuring a robust pipeline of antibiotic treatments.

**What is AMR?**

It refers to the **ability of microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites**, to resist the effects of antimicrobial drugs, such as antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals, and antiparasitic drugs. E.g., New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM-1) superbug

**Status of AMR:**

It was responsible for nearly **5 million global deaths** in 2019 and is projected to cause over **2mn death by 2050** in India alone. Yet the **development of new antibiotics is limited**, and access to existing treatments remains a challenge.

**What does the Report say:**

- AMR remains **one of the top 10 global public health** threats facing humanity
- **1 in 5 deaths** caused by AMR occurred in children under the age of 5.
- If no action is taken, **AMR could cost the world’s economy** USD 100 trillion by 2050.
- **Recommendations by the report**: increased investments in **research and development**, alignment of **financing mechanisms**, and global efforts to ensure **equitable access to antibiotics**.

**What are the problems with AMR in India?**

AMR is a particular challenge in India due to the high burden of communicable diseases, an overburdened public health system, limited laboratory capacity, inexpensive and widely available antibiotics without prescriptions, Excessive use of antibiotics in livestock and poultry farming etc

**Other initiatives:**

- **India**: **National Action Plan on AMR** (NAP-AMR) for 2017-2021 (updating it for 2022-2026)
- **Global**: **One Health Quadripartite**: In 2021, the FAO, UNEP, WHO and World Organisation for Animal Health joined to combat AMR.

**Conclusion:**

There is a need for **priority actions to accelerate progress,** including commitments at the **high-level meeting on AMR** at the **United Nations General Assembly in 2024** and targeted financing mechanisms to address the crisis and ensure equitable access to antibiotics.

 **Context: Khasi Hills Autonomous District Council (KHADC)** ordered not to issue an ST certificate to any Khasi person who adopts their father’s surname as it is **against the traditional custom of inheriting the mother’s surname.**

**What is the matrilineal system among Khasis?**

It refers to a **social and kinship system** where descent and inheritance are traced through the **female line**. In this system, family lineage, property, and clan membership are passed down from mother to daughter. Among Khasis, the **youngest daughter (khatduh)** of the family is entrusted the full share of the ancestral – **or the clan’s – property**

The three tribes of Meghalaya — **Khasis, Jaintias, and Garos** — practise a matrilineal system of inheritance.

**About Khasis Tribe:**

The Khasis are an **indigenous community in Meghalaya**. While the majority of Khasis are **Christians** now, their traditional beliefs revolved around a **Supreme Being called U Blei Nongthaw**. The Khasi community celebrates festivals such as the **Nongkrem Dance and Shad Suk Mynsiem.**

**About KHADC:**

- KHADC is a **body under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution.**
- The **Sixth Schedule** of the Constitution provides for the administration **of tribal areas in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram**to safeguard the **rights of the tribal population in these states.**
- It provides for **autonomy in the administration** of these areas through **Autonomous District Councils (ADCs),**which are empowered to make laws in respect of areas under their jurisdiction.

### [ECL-based loan loss provisioning norms](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/18/ecl-based-loan-loss-provisioning-norms/)

#### **Facts For Prelims**

**Source:** [**Indian Express**](https://indianexpress.com/article/business/banking-and-finance/banks-request-rbi-for-more-time-to-implement-new-ecl-based-loan-loss-provisioning-norms-8613283/)

**Context:** Lenders have sought a **one-year extension from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI**) for implementation of the **Expected Credit Loss (ECL)-based loan loss provisioning framework**.

**What is loan loss provisioning?**

Loan loss provisioning refers to the practice of **setting aside funds by banks to** cover **potential losses arising** from loans that may default or become unrecoverable.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Current System**|Banks are required to **make loan loss provisions** based on an “**incurred loss” approach**. Also, the Loan loss provisioning happens much later, leading to an **increase in credit risk for banks**.|
|**“Incurred Loss” model**|This model assumes that **all loans will be repaid until evidence** to the contrary is identified. Only at that point is the defaulted loan written down to a lower value. This leads to a delay in the recognition of defaults.|
|**The New Proposal**|RBI has proposed an **expected loss (EL)-based approach** for provisioning by banks in case of loan defaults. Banks are required to **estimate expected credit losses** based on forward-looking estimations. Banks have to **categorize ECL norms** for assessing the quality of assets and the expected loss.|
|||
|**ECL Norms**|Banks classify financial assets (**primarily loans, including irrevocable loan commitments, and investments classified as held-to-maturity or available-for-sale**) into three categories: **Stage 1, Stage 2, and Stage 3.**<br><br>**Stage 1:** Financial assets that have not had a significant increase in credit risk or with low credit risk at the reporting date.<br><br>**Stage 2:** Financial instruments that have had a significant increase in credit risk but don’t have objective evidence of impairment.<br><br>**Stage 3**: Financial assets that have objective evidence of impairment at the reporting date|

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/govt-ai-face-recognition-tool-astr-detect-phone-frauds-8614162/)

**Context:** The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has launched the **Artificial Intelligence and Facial Recognition powered Solution for Telecom SIM Subscriber Verification (ASTR) tool** to detect and block fraudulent mobile connections.

**About ASTR:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Dimensions**|**Description**|
|**Purpose**|To detect and block fraudulent mobile connections|
|**Origin**|In 2012, the DoT ordered telecom operators to share their **subscriber database, including user pictures.** These images form the basis for the facial recognition algorithm used in ASTR. The ASTR project was **developed by the DoT’s unit** in Haryana between **April 2021 and July 2021.**|
|**Technology Used**|Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Facial Recognition|
|**Functionality**|**Analyzing subscriber databases** to identify multiple connections associated with the **same person**|
|**Example of its working**|Suppose there is a **suspected face associated with multiple mobile connections**. ASTR will **compare this face against a database of images to identify other connections** linked to the same face. If there are more than nine connections against a single individual’s photograph or if the same person has taken SIMs under different names, ASTR will flag it as potentially fraudulent.|
|**Connection Limit**|Currently, a **maximum of nine mobile connections** can be taken using a single identity proof|
|**Action Taken**|The list of fraudulent connections will be shared with telecom operators, banks, payment wallets, and social media platforms|
|**Description of technology used:**|   |
|**Image Processing**|**Faces in subscriber images** are encoded using convolutional neural network (CNN) models|
|**Face Comparison**|A face **comparison is carried** out for each face against all faces in the database to group similar faces under one directory|
|**Matching Accuracy**|Faces are considered identical if they match to the extent of **at least 97.5%**|
|**Name Matching**|**“Fuzzy logic”** is used to find similarity or approximate matches for subscriber names, accounting for typographical errors|

### [An integrated system of medicine](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/19/an-integrated-system-of-medicine/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Issues Relating to Development and Management of Social Sector/Services Relating to Health**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/can-an-integrated-system-of-medicine-work/article66866483.ece)

**Context:** The ICMR under the Union Health Ministry and the Union Ministry of Ayush has agreed to enhance cooperation in health research in the field of **integrated medicine.**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**An integrated system of medicine/complementary medicine**|   |
|**Meaning**|It means **a conjoint study, training and practice** in indigenous/traditional medicine (ayurveda, Unani, etc) and modern (allopathy) medicine.|
|**Why do patients favour complementary medicine?**|**5 barriers(5As) to healthcare:** awareness, access, acceptability, affordability, and accountability.|
|Complementary medicine gives people with chronic diseases who have already tried a number of things an **option**. That is why, **50% of people use complementary medicine**, and more than 70% have used it at some point during their lifetime.|
|**Concerns**|**No evidence-based benefits** of complementary medicine, lack of data on safety and efficacy, and a lack of standardization of formulations.|
|**Integrative medicine is a business:** Data shows that it increases the cost of care and does not improve the patient’s clinical outcomes.|
|**Efforts to promote complementary medicine in India**|**The National Integrated Medical Association** (NIMA) is an Indian **NGO** of general practitioners educated in integrated system of medicine.|
|**The National Ayush Mission** (launched in 2014) has played a crucial role in preserving and promoting India’s traditional systems of medicine and their integration into the mainstream healthcare system.|
|**WHO Global Centre for Traditional Medicine** (Jamnagar, Gujarat) was set up to promote Traditional Medicines as a system of treatment for various ailments.|
|**CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine** is a premier institute located in Jammu and dedicated to the research of drug discovery.|
|Some universities in India offer **BISM (Bachelor in Integrated System of Medicine)**|

**What is the agreement between ICMR and the Ministry of Ayush:** The two-day National Ayush Mission Conclave talks about the practice at AIIMS and research in complementary medicine.

**Significance of the move:**

- It will **enhance the treatments** that can be offered under one roof.
- It will help **build harmonized protocols** for clinical care research, and this is especially important for **non-communicable diseases**, where medical treatment options are limited.
- It will take Ayurveda and yoga to the world.

**Way ahead:** Randomised control trials (RCTs) and peer-reviewed studies of traditional medicine must be promoted.

**Conclusion:** Many systems of medicine have a role to play in keeping human beings well. Modern medicine is extremely important, but there is a wealth of wisdom and ancient traditions which can be incorporated sensibly and safely for the well-being of man.

### [Financial Inclusion in Rural India](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/19/financial-inclusion-in-rural-india/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Inclusive Growth, Issues Relating to Poverty/ Welfare Schemes for Vulnerable Sections**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/climate-change/access-to-financial-services-can-help-rural-india-cope-with-climate-risks-study-89405)

 **Context:** According to a new study, **access to financial services such as bank accounts can help Indian rural households cope better with challenges** such as poverty, inequality, and climate risks.

**Need for** [**financial inclusion**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Financial-Inclusion-in-India.pdf) **in rural India:**

- A key driver of economic growth, poverty alleviation and prosperity.
- Access to formal finance can boost **job creation, reduce vulnerability to economic and climate shocks and increase investments in human capital**.
- At a macro level, it can support sustainable and inclusive socio-economic growth for all.

**Financial institutions for inclusion:**

- Scheduled commercial banks
- Regional rural banks
- Payment banks
- Micro-finance institutions
- **Business correspondents (Bank Mitra)**
- Small finance banks

**Highlights of the study:**

- **59% of the surveyed households experienced climate shocks** in at least one of the five previous years → **using their own savings to cope with the issue.**
- As rural households have **limited access to liquidity**, they **take high-interest loans** from informal sources.
- **Households rely on financial assistance** from kin and relatives followed by friends, village communities, money lenders, and banks (in this order).

**Factors affecting access to financial services:**

- **Location:** Most commercial banks set up their branches in profitable urban commercial areas.
- **Lack of infrastructure in rural and semi-urban areas:** Lack of access to a formal banking outlet, proper internet, electricity, etc., are major roadblocks to both consumers and financial institutions.
- **Rising unemployment and low wages:** Financial conditions of people plays a pivotal role in accessing available financial services.
- **Service charges:** High bank charges not only discourage people but also create a lack of trust among people using banking and financial services.

**Government efforts:**

- **The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY)**
- **Direct Benefits Transfer (DBT)**
- **Aadhaar Enabled Payment Services (AePS)**
- **Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM)-UPI**

**Key challenges for India:** While **80**% of the Indian population may have bank accounts, almost **45**% of such accounts still remain inactive due to a combination of –

**Best practices:**

- Companies such as **Vakrangee Ltd., BTI payments, FINO**, etc., have provided many banking and ATM services through a technology-driven platform.
    - They have managed to **boost rural entrepreneurship and increase the level of financial literacy**.
- **The PM Mudra Yojana** provides collateral-free loans up to Rs. 1 million for small and micro enterprises.

**Way ahead:**

- **Financial inclusion** will reduce the resources that households need to keep in liquid form and **therefore make them available for productive investments to address climate risk.**
- **Climate adaptation** requires putting resources in the hands of people because they are best placed to understand climate impacts.
