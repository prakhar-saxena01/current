#### **GS Paper 1/2**

 **Syllabus:** **Indian culture/Salient features of the Indian Constitution**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/supreme-court-upholds-tamil-nadu-jallikattu-explained-8616020/#:~:text=This%20was%20the%20'Welfare%20Board,.%20A.%20Nagaraja'%20case.)

**Context:** A five-judge Bench of the SC upheld the amendments made by TN, Maharashtra and Karnataka to [**The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (PCA) Act 1960**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/12/18/prevention-of-cruelty-to-animals-act-1960-2/#:~:text=This%20Act%20provides%20for%20punishment,on%20animals%20for%20scientific%20purposes.), allowing bull-taming sports like [Jallikattu](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/01/10/jallikattu/), Kambala, and bullock-cart races.

**What is** [**Jallikattu**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/01/10/jallikattu/)**/eruthazhuvuthal?**

- It is **a bull-taming sport** traditionally played in TN as part of the **Pongal** harvest festival and as a celebration of nature, of which cattle worship is a part.
- However, it has long been **contested** **over cruelty to animals and the bloody and dangerous nature of the sport.**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Background of the case:**|   |
|**Welfare Board of India v. A. Nagaraja 2014**|A two-judge Bench of the SC **banned such sports** including Jallikattu.<br><br>·        The apex court held “bovine sports” **contrary to the PCA Act** – fixes duties of persons in charge of animals and defines animal cruelty.<br><br>·        The PCA Act **overrides the so-called tradition and culture** and the Parliament must elevate rights of animals to that of constitutional rights (under Articles 14, 21).|
|**MoEFCC notification, 2016**|It prohibited the “exhibition or training of bulls as performing animals”.<br><br>However, **an exception specified that bulls might still be trained as performing animals** at Jallikattu, according to the customs and culture of different communities.|
|**TN amended the PCA Act in 2017**|·        **This was done to allow Jallikattu in the state**, to preserve the cultural heritage of TN, to ensure the survival and well-being of the native breeds of bulls, and to minimize cruelty to animals in the concerned sports<br><br>●       A batch of petitions were filed challenging the above exemption and the amendments, following which **the SC referred the matter to the Constitution Bench**, as the issue involved interpretation of the Constitution.<br><br>●       The Bench was tasked with deciding whether Jallikattu could be preserved as the cultural right of TN under [**Article 29(1) of the Constitution**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/indian-constitution/significant-provisions/fundamental-rights/fundamental-rights-articles-12-35/culture-and-educational-rights/)**.**|
|**The recent verdict of the SC:**|   |
|●       **It overruled** its 2014 ruling in ‘Welfare Board of India v. A. Nagaraja’ and held that Jallikattu has a strong cultural component.<br><br>●       The amendments (to the PCA) were “**valid legislations**”, as these are **not a piece of colourable legislation** and that it relates to List III of the 7th Schedule to the Constitution [prevention of cruelty to animals].<br><br>●       The court also said that the 2017 amendment **does not violate** –<br><br>○       **Articles 51-A (g) and 51-A (h)**, which impose duties on Indian citizens to protect the environment and develop a scientific temper, humanism, spirit of inquiry, and reform, respectively.<br><br>○       **Articles 14** (Right to Equality) and **21** (Right to Life) of the Constitution.<br><br>●       However, the Jallikattu issue is “debatable” and **must ultimately be decided by the Parliament,** as the issue requires social and cultural analysis in greater detail.|   |

### [Combating forest fires in Uttarakhand](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/19/combating-forest-fires-in-uttarakhand/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus: Disaster management**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/forests/here-are-some-ways-to-combat-forest-fires-in-chir-pine-belt-of-uttarakhand-89422)

 **Context:** The chir pine belt of [Uttarakhand, India, faces **significant forest fire**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/05/17/forest-fires/) **challenges**.

**What is Chir Pine Belt?**

It refers to an area characterized by the **dominance of chir pine trees** (Pinus roxburghii). It is found primarily in the state of Uttarakhand. The high presence of **chir pine trees** in this belt also contributes to the **susceptibility to forest fires in the area**.

**About the chir pine:**

It is a species of pine tree that is **native to the Himalayan region**. It is a **fast-growing evergreen tree and forms dense forests** in the sub-tropical and temperate regions of Uttarakhand.

**Factors contributing to forest fire challenges in the Chir Pine Belt of Uttarakhand:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Factors**|**Description**|
|**High forest density**|Uttarakhand accounts for **1.6 per cent of India’s total geographical area**. But in terms of forest cover, the state accounts for **45 per cent**, in contrast to national forest cover of just **21.67 per cent.**|
|**High presence of pine trees**|Chir pine dominates the forest composition in the region. Pine trees are rich in **organic polymers**, making them **vulnerable to forest fires**.|
|**Dry biomass**|Pine needles and other plant-based litter create fuel for fires. Dry biomass increases the risk of fire outbreaks.|
|**Vulnerability of narrow-leaved species**|The forest ecosystem in the region is dominated by **narrow-leaved species** **like Pinus, Picea, and Abies**. These species are **susceptible to fires** when exposed to low temperatures and humidity.|
|**Human-made fires**|**Timber smugglers** often set intentional fires to divert attention and facilitate illegal activities. **Developmental activities** and **unchecked land-use patterns** contribute to human-induced fire hazards.|
|**Climate conditions**|Uttarakhand experiences **low rainfall and high temperatures**. The ample availability of **dry biomass** during the **summer season** increases fire risks. Also, **Strong winds** contribute to the rapid spread of fires across the forests.|

**Measures to Combat Forest Fires in the Chir Pine Belt of Uttarakhand:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Measures**|**Description**|
|**Plantation of suitable broad-leaved species**|Introduce species like **oak and rhododendron** with lower fire susceptibility. Diversify the **forest composition** and reduce the overall fire risk.|
|**Construction of watch towers for early detection**|Install **watch towers to detect forest fires** at an early stage. Facilitate prompt response and intervention to control fire incidents.|
|**Deployment of fire watchers**|Assign personnel as **fire watchers in vulnerable areas**. **Regular surveillance** to detect and report fires promptly.|
|**Creation and maintenance of fire lines**|Clear vegetation creates **fire lines and fire breaks as barriers**.|
|**Use of remote sensing technology and satellite data**|Utilize technology to **detect active forest fires** from space.  Enable early identification and timely response to fire incidents.|
|**Exclusive recruitment of forest fire-fighting staff**|**Employ trained personnel equipped** with modern firefighting technologies. Ensure specialized teams are available for fire suppression.|
|[**Joint Forest Management (JFM**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/environment-degradation-and-issues/forest-ecosystem/forest-conservation/joint-forest-management/)**), Van panchayats, and communication**|**Promote community involvement** and cooperation in forest management. Utilize electronic, social media, radio, and television for awareness. Raise **awareness and encourage responsible** forest practices.|

**National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA)** has suggested measures for **fire control in Himalayan regions** such as Early detection and reporting; Fireline creation; Community involvement; Training and capacity building; Use of technology and Firefighting teams.

**A few measures taken are:**

National Policy on Forest Fire (finalized by the government); National Plan for forest fire management; National Forest Fire Danger Rating System; Firefighting tools and machinery (e.g. Fire Beaters, Pulaskis Tools, Forest Fire Showel, etc.); Forest Fire Prevention & Management Scheme (FFPMS, 2017)

**Conclusion:**

**Addressing and mitigating forest fires** in the Himalayan region requires a comprehensive approach that includes early detection, community involvement, capacity building, technology utilization, and effective collaboration between various stakeholders. By implementing these measures, the **risk and impact of forest fires can** be significantly reduced, protecting the invaluable biodiversity and ecological balance of the region.

### [US debt ceiling deal](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/19/us-debt-ceiling-deal/)

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/biden-republicans-spar-debt-ceiling-deal-8616699/)

 **Context:** The US government is facing a crucial issue regarding the debt ceiling.  

**About Debt Ceiling:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Topic**|**Debt Ceiling**|
|**Definition**|The **maximum amount of money** that the US government is legally allowed to borrow to fund its operations and meet its financial obligations. It sets a cap or limit on the total amount of government debt.|
|**Origin**|Established by the **US Congress in 1917 during World War I** to promote fiscal responsibility in the federal government.|
|**Issue**|Disagreement between **President Joe Biden (executive) and the Republican-controlled US Congress (Legislature)** on raising the debt ceiling. The decision to increase the borrowing **cap lies with the US Congress**, which needs to vote on it.|
|**Impact**|Possible **government default if the debt ceiling** is not raised, leading to economic consequences such as a weaker dollar, stock market problems, and job losses.|
|The downgrade of the **US credit rating** made future borrowing more expensive for the government.|
|Hinders **discussions on long-term fiscal challenges** and has become a **political tool** instead of a responsible fiscal mechanism.|
|**Impact on India**|Increased **volatility in financial markets affects** currency exchange rates, capital flows, and investor confidence.|
|Impact on **India’s exports, foreign direct investment**, and overall economic stability.|
|**Previous instance**|In 2011, the US faced a near default on public debt due to a delay in raising the debt ceiling. This led to the first downgrade in the US credit rating, a sharp drop in the stock market, and higher borrowing costs.|
|**Suggestions for reforms**|Automatic increase of the debt limit whenever legislation is passed or abolishing the debt limit altogether|
|**India’s Debt Ceiling Mechanism**|India **does not have a formal debt ceiling mechanism** like the one in the United States.<br><br>The Indian government **manages borrowing and debt obligations** through fiscal discipline, budgetary controls, and oversight by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The **Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act** governs India’s borrowing activities, setting targets for fiscal deficits and debt-to-GDP ratios.|

### [Minimum Import Price for Apples](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/19/minimum-import-price-for-apples/)

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**TOI**](https://m.timesofindia.com/business/india-business/govt-introduces-minimum-import-price-for-apples-in-jk-to-support-local-growers/articleshow/100285758.cms#:~:text=This%20policy%20mandates%20that%20any,the%20apple%20growers%20of%20J%26K.)

 **Context:** The Central Government of India has introduced the **Minimum Import Price (MIP)** for apples in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) **to protect the domestic industry** from unfair competition and [predatory pricing](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/03/07/what-is-predatory-pricing/#:~:text=Predatory%20pricing%20is%20the%20illegal,more%20vulnerable%20to%20a%20monopoly.).

**What is MIP?**

MIP is a **temporary measure implemented by a government** to protect domestic industries from unfair competition and **predatory pricing of imported goods**. The MIP sets a **minimum price below which the import** of a particular commodity is not allowed.

**Who frames the rules:**

**The Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT)** is the arm of the commerce ministry responsible for framing rules related to exports and imports, including the implementation of MIPs.

**Significance**: By setting a minimum import price, the government aims to prevent apple imports from flooding the market at excessively low prices, and provide a **level playing field** to farmers in J&K.

**About Apple cultivation:**

 Apple cultivation in India primarily **takes place in regions such as Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, the hills of Uttar Pradesh and Uttaranchal**. It is also grown to a lesser extent in Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Punjab, and Sikkim. China produces the **world’s largest number of apples**. India is ranked **5th**.

**Climatic condition for Apples:**

 The ideal climatic conditions for apple cultivation include an **average summer temperature of 21-24 degrees** **Celsiu**s during the active growth period. Apple trees can be grown at altitudes ranging from **1500 to 2700 meters above sea level**. Well-distributed rainfall of **1000-1250 mm throughout** the growing season is **most favourable** for the optimal growth and fruitfulness of apple trees. Additionally, apples thrive best in **well-drained, loamy soils.**

### [Global temperature likely to breach 1.5°C threshold by 2027](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/19/global-temperature-likely-to-breach-1-5c-threshold-by-2027/)

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**WMO**](https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/global-temperatures-set-reach-new-records-next-five-years)

**Context:** According to the **World Meteorological Organization (WMO)**, global temperatures are now more likely than not to **exceed the 1.5°C (2.7°F) warming threshold** within the next five years.

**About the Finding:** WMO’s **Global Annual to Decadal Climate Update** highlights a **66%** chance of temporarily exceeding **1.5°C by** 2027 (than the average global temperature from 1850-1900), a significant increase from last year’s estimate of approximately 50-50 odds.

- **Threshold of 5°C:** This threshold is **critical to avoid the disastrous** consequences of global warming, as warned by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
- **Hottest year:** The WMO’s predictions also indicate a **98% chance that one of the next five** years will be the hottest on record, surpassing the previous record set in 2016.

**Reason for increased likelihood**: [El Niño](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/15/el-nino-and-monsoon/), combined with human-induced [climate change](https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/climate-change-and-associated-issues/) will contribute to higher global temperatures.

**Significance**: This represents the **first time in history that surpassing 1.5°C is** considered more probable than not, thus indicating an alarming trend.

**Impact on India**: The increased temperature will likely lead to lower monsoon rainfall.
