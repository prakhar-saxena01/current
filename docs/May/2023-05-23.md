### [Judicial recusals](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/23/judicial-recusals/)

####  **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus:** **Structure, Organization and Functioning of the Judiciary**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/explained-why-do-judges-recuse-themselves-and-how-a-look-at-recent-judicial-recusals/article66858096.ece)

 **Context:** Calling it an attempt to indulge in ‘bench hunting’, a former SC judge refused (last week) to recuse himself from hearing a plea.

**What is recusal?**

- It is the act of declining to take part in an official activity, such as a court case because the administrative or court authority presiding over it has a **conflict of interest.**
- This **conflict of interest can arise** in many ways – from holding shares in a litigant company to having a prior or personal association with a party.

**The practice of judicial recusals stems from:**

- **The cardinal principles of due process of law:**
    - **Nemo judex in sua causa** – no person shall be a judge in his own case.
    - Justice must not only be done but must also be seen to be done.
- **The oath of office:** Both the SC and HC judges promise to perform their duties without fear or favour, affection or ill-will, in accordance with the **III Schedule** of the Constitution.
- **Restatement of the Values of Judicial Life adopted by the SC:** It forbids a judge from deciding a case where he holds pecuniary interest unless the concerned parties clarify that they have no objections.

**Recent instances of judicial recusals:**

- **In the afore-mentioned case** involving a former IPS officer (Sanjiv Bhat), recusal was sought on the ground that there was a likelihood of bias since the same Judge, a Gujarat HC judge had reprimanded the IPS officer.
- **The CJI rejected an application** seeking his recusal from hearing petitions seeking legal recognition of same-sex marriages.
- **Justice Gita Gopi of the Gujarat HC** recused herself from hearing Rahul Gandhi’s appeal seeking a stay on his conviction in the criminal defamation case.

**Why do judges recuse?**

- To prevent the perception that the judge was **biased** while deciding a case.
- When an appeal is filed in the SC against an HC judgment delivered by the concerned judge before his elevation.

**What is the procedure for recusal?**

- Although several SC judgments have dealt with the issue, **India has no codified rules** governing recusals.
- **There are two kinds of recusals** – automatic (where a judge himself withdraws from the case) or when a party raises a plea for recusal.
- The decision to recuse rests solely on the **conscience and discretion of the judge** and no party can compel a judge to withdraw from a case.
- If a judge recuses himself, **the case is listed before the Chief Justice for allotment to an alternate Bench.**

**Do judges have to record reasons for recusal?**

Since there are no statutory rules governing the process, **it is often left to the judges** themselves to record reasons for recusals.

**Concerns:**

- The majority of the time, the grounds for recusal are not made public, which endangers **judicial transparency.**
- However, the Delhi HC recently ruled that any investigation into the reasons for recusal would constitute **an interference with the course of justice.**

**What rules have the SC formulated in the past?**

- **Ranjit Thakur v. Union of India (1987):** To determine if a judge should recuse, what is relevant is the reasonableness of the apprehension of bias in the mind of the concerned party.
- **State of West Bengal v. Shivananda Pathak (1998)**: Judicial bias is a condition of mind which renders the judge incapable of impartiality in a particular case.
- **SC Advocates-on-Record Association v. Union of India (2015)**: Where a judge has a pecuniary interest, no further inquiry is needed to establish whether there is a ‘real danger’ of bias.
- **Indore Development Authority v. Manoharlal and Ors (2019)**: Merely having a legal opinion does not disentitle one from being impartial.

**Practice in foreign jurisdictions:**

- **The United State**s has a well-defined law on recusals, which details the grounds for recusal – financial or corporate interest, a case in which the judge was a material witness or a lawyer, and a relationship to a party.
- **The United Kingdom’s law** laid down a standard to look at the likelihood of bias from the perspective of a fair-minded and reasonable observer.

**Conclusion:**

- **It is the judge’s ‘constitutional duty’ to be ‘transparent and accountable’** and therefore reasons must be indicated for recusal (Justice Kurien Joseph).
- There is a need for ‘**procedural and substantive rules** to deal with the growing frequency of recusal pleas (Justice Madan Lokur).

### [Forum for India Pacific Islands Cooperation (FIPIC)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/23/forum-for-india-pacific-islands-cooperation-fipic/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **International Relations**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pm-modi-underlines-importance-of-free-and-open-indo-pacific-at-fipic-summit-in-papua-new-guinea/article66879690.ece)

 **Context:** Addressing the opening session of the **FIPIC-3 summit** (in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea/PNG), the PM of India highlighted the importance of the 14 members of the FIPIC.

**The Pacific Island Countries (PICs):**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/PIC-1.png)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/PIC-1.png)

- It consists of the 3 major groups of islands: **Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia,** and commonly refers to the **14** countries scattered in the South-West Pacific Ocean.
- **These are the** Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Niue, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.
- The region comprises **strategically located** (at the crossroads of significant maritime trade routes) **small island nations**, with small populations and **resource-rich Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs)**.
- Their profile is rising particularly given the popularity of the **Indo-Pacific construct.**

**India’s engagement with the PICs:**

- **In the early 19th century**, Indian workers were taken to the region to work as indentured plantation labourers and most of whom settled particularly in Fiji and PNG.
- **After independence**, the region did not find much significance in India’s foreign policy.
- However, the changing geopolitical scenario and strategic and economic compulsions, rising naval capabilities have driven India **to refresh and redesign its Pacific policy.**
- India’s renewed interest can also be seen in the light of its own **rechristened Act East policy**.
- At this moment, the total annual trade between India and PICs is about **$300 million –** exports are around $200 million and imports are around $100 million.

**The Forum for India-Pacific Islands Cooperation (FIPIC):**

- It was launched during the PM of India’s visit to Fiji in **2014** and **includes 14 of the PICs.**
- The FIPIC initiative marks a serious effort to expand (from the Indian Ocean) India’s **strategic and commercial interests** in the **Pacific region**.

**India’s major assistance projects in the PICs:**

- Setting up **a special USD 1 million fund** for adapting to climate change and clean energy, **establishing a trade office in India**, Pan Pacific Islands **e-network** to improve digital connectivity.
- India has **increased the annual “Grant-in-Aid”** from USD 125,000 to 200,000 to each of the 14 PICs for community projects of their choice, and **launched a new Visitors Programme for PICs**.
- At the FIPIC-2 (Jaipur, 2015), FICCI launched the **Business Accelerator** for FIPIC to provide necessary information and facilitation to businessmen on both sides.

**The advantage to India:** Presence of a sizable Indian Diaspora – nearly 40% of Fiji’s population is of Indian origin and about 3000 Indians live in PNG.

**Challenges:** India’s interaction with the PICs **still largely revolves around its engagement with Fiji and PNG.**

**Way ahead:**

- **Climate change** is a crucial area of common concern where closer partnerships can be developed for effective and concrete solutions.
- For India, it is important to develop **a comprehensive and clearly defined strategy to engage with all the PICs.**

**Conclusion:**

- The PM of India (at the FIPIC-3) called PICs “**large ocean states**”, highlighting their strategic-commercial importance for India.
- The recent efforts have brought India much closer to PICs and to further strengthen its ties, **India should assist the development goals of the PICs.**

#### **GS3/GS2**

 **Syllabus: E-Commerce/ Governance**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/explained-what-is-the-open-network-for-digital-commerce/article66878581.ece#:~:text=challenge%20for%20ONDC.-,The%20Union%20government%20is%20looking%20to%20formally%20launch%20the%20Open,as%20a%20success%20by%20many.)

 **Context:** The article analyses the **advantages and challenges of adopting an Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC)** in India.

**What is ONDC?**

 **The Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) is a government initiative** aimed at transforming the **e-commerce market** in India by shifting from a **platform-centric model** to an **open-network model.**

Similar to the success of the **Unified Payments Interface (UPI) project**, which enables seamless money transfers across different payment platforms, the ONDC seeks to facilitate **transactions between buyers and sellers regardless** of the platforms they are registered on.

**Explanation using an example:**

Let’s imagine **you want to buy a product online**, like a **smartphone**. You are registered on Amazon, but you find a **better deal on Flipkart** for the same smartphone you want to buy. In the current system, you **wouldn’t be able** to purchase it from Flipkart because you’re not registered there.

But ONDC is like a **big network that connects all the different e-commerce platforms** together. So instead of being limited to one specific platform, you can buy products from different platforms, even if you are registered on only one of them.

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ONDC_1.png)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ONDC_1.png)

**Objectives of ONDC:** Democratization and decentralization of e-Commerce; Inclusivity and access for sellers; Increased choices and independence for consumers and making goods and services cheaper.

**Benefits and Challenges of ONDC:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Benefits of ONDC**|**Challenges of ONDC**|
|**Level Playing Field** for e-commerce operators|**Technological Complexity** of Implementation|
|**Wider digital market access** for MSMEs and traders|Customer **switching from established platforms**— a loss for established e-commerce companies|
|**Drives competition and innovation** in various sectors|**Limited benefits** as **sellers are already free to list their products** across various **e-commerce platforms** even in today’s platform-centric e-commerce model.|
|Increased **freedom of choice** for consumers—”**Democratise e-commerce**” and “provide alternatives to proprietary e-commerce sites”.|**Limited benefits** as **services such as price-comparison** that are offered by various private websites, already bridge the information gap and help buyers make better decisions.|
|Creates a **neutral and regulated platform**|**Lack of clarity on addressing customer** complaints and returns|
|Promotes **openness, interoperability, and innovation**|**Major e-commerce players** like Amazon and Flipkart **hesitate to join ONDC** due to loss of control, existing dominance, competitive disadvantage, infrastructure challenges, and control over pricing/policies.|
|Enhances **transparency and accountability**||

**The way forward and Conclusion:**

The success of the **Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC)** will depend on how efficient the listing of products from **various sellers is and maintaining the quality of services.** The government needs to focus on building a **better digital space, implementing a digital education policy, conducting a well-funded adoption campaign**, and providing a secured **single window for issue resolution**.

Bushfire is a wildfire that **occurs in bushland or forested areas**. It is characterized by **uncontrollable flames** that rapidly spread and can **cause significant damage** to vegetation, wildlife, and property.

**Australia faces frequent bushfires** due to its **hot and dry climate, flammable vegetation** like eucalypt forests, weather patterns including droughts and strong winds, and human activities like land clearing and arson.

To deal with it, a highly effective bushfire management program has been developed over the past 20 years. From April to June each year, **fire managers use small controlled fires** to reduce **fuel loads** and make the landscape safer. This practice, known as “**painting with fire**,” combines satellite data with **Indigenous knowledge** and expertise from pastoralists and park rangers.

**Significance**: The program has led to **significant declines in fire across** the region and has gained international attention as a **model for fire management**. It highlights the importance of integrating **technology, local knowledge, and diverse skills** to achieve sustainable and resilient environmental management.

**Usage**: Such techniques can be used for Indian forest fire management as well. Such solutions can be used in Disaster Management/ Environment/ Geography Questions.

- But the **total amount allocated toward providing incentives** for these vehicles will be raised from the **current ₹2,000 crores**.

**The rationale for changes:**

The intention behind lowering the subsidy and increasing the funds for electric two-wheelers is to **support more consumers through the FAME scheme** with the available funds.

**About the FAME Scheme:**

 **Context:** A pangenome reference map has been built using genomes from 47 anonymous individuals from **Africa, the Caribbean, the Americas, East Asia, and Europe**.

**About Pangenome Map**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Topic**|**Description**|
|**What is Pangenome Map?**|A pangenome map is a **way of looking at the collective genetic information of a group** of related organisms or species. It goes beyond just one individual’s genetic makeup and considers the genetic diversity within that group.|
|**What is genome and genome sequencing?**|The human genome refers to the e**ntire set of DNA in the nucleus of every cell in the human bod**y. It is like an **identity card (e.g., Aadhar) unique to each individual**. Genome sequencing is a method used to **determine the precise order and arrangement of the four letters** (A, T, G, and C) in the genome. It helps us understand **human diversity at the genetic level** and our susceptibility to **certain diseases.**|
|**What is a reference genome?**|A reference genome is a **complete set of genetic information** for a specific individual. When newly sequenced genomes are compared, they are matched against a **reference map** called a reference genome.|
|**How pangenome map is different from the Reference genome?**|While a reference genome represents **a single individual**, a pangenome map captures the **genetic diversity and variation across** multiple individuals or populations.|
|**Principle**|The concept of a pangenome acknowledges that a **species’ genome is not a fixed entity and is different for different individuals.** This genetic variation contributes to differences in traits, disease susceptibility, and other biological characteristics.|
|**Why is a pangenome map important?**|A pangenome map provides a comprehensive understanding of a **species’ genetic content.**  This helps explain **genetic differences, and human diversity, study gene evolution,** identify disease-associated genes, and understand the overall genomic architecture of a species.<br><br>This can shed light on **disease prevalence, aid in discovering new genes for rare diseases**, design **better diagnostic methods**, and facilitate the discovery of novel drugs for those diseases.|
|**Pangenome map and India**|The current pangenome map **does not include genome sequences from Indians.** However, it can still help map Indian genomes against existing **error-free and complete reference genomes**.|

### [Tipping Points](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/23/tipping-points/)

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/climate-change-to-push-30-species-over-tipping-points-study/article66880055.ece)

 **Context:** A study suggests that **climate change could push up to 30%** of species over tipping points as their geographic ranges experience unforeseen temperatures.

**About Tipping Points:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
||**Description**|
|**Definition**|‘Tipping points’ are **thresholds where the earth’s systems** can no longer stabilize. Crossing these points becomes **more dangerous with increased warming.**|
|**Explanation**|For example, the melting of Greenland’s ice can reach a tipping point where the ice loss accelerates, leading to a significant rise in sea levels.|
|**Examples of tipping point**|Melting of Greenland ice; Collapse of Antarctic glaciers (resulting in sea level rise); Destruction of Amazon forests; Melting of all permafrost, etc.|
|**Recent Findings**|**Five dangerous tipping** points may have already been passed due to **1.1°C o**f global heating caused by human activity.|
|**Impacts on Animals**|When their geographic **ranges experience unfamiliarly hot temperatures**, up to 30% of species could be at risk. This can lead to **habitat loss and potential extinction**. Animals may need to **adapt or migrate to cooler regions**, but the short timeframe makes it challenging.|
|**Actions Needed**|Urgent action to **reduce carbon emissions is crucial to mitigate** harm and prevent an extinction crisis. Conservation efforts should be guided by early warning systems to protect vulnerable species.|

 **Context:** A new study has found that the **world’s top 21 fossil fuel companies** owed over US **$ 5 trillion** in climate reparations, to be disbursed over **a 26-year period from 2025 to 2050**.

**The companies with the highest reparations**: ExxonMobil, Saudi Aramco, and Shell.

**About Climate reparations:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
||**Description**|
|**Definition**|Climate reparations aim to **rectify climate injustice** by requiring those most responsible for climate change to provide **support to those who have been wronged.**|
|**Principles of Climate Reparations**|**Polluter pays principle** (Polluters should be held liable for the costs of remedial action); **More responsibility of rich countries** (for past historical emissions); **Reparations-based approach** to climate refugees; Rich countries should provide financial and technological support to developing nations|
|**Steps Taken**|**Warsaw International Mechanism** (WIM) (Established in 2013 to compensate developing countries affected by climate disasters); **Green Climate Fund** (promise of $100 billion per year by 2020); Least Developed Countries Fund|
|**Additional Measures Needed for Reparations**|Establish an **international compensation commission** to handle claims from countries that have incurred adaptation expenses, similar to the **United Nations Claims Commission;** Prioritize adaptation measures; Establish a separate channel for loss and damages; **Long-term climate finance**; enforce legal measures for petroleum companies to share a part of their profit for GHG mitigation efforts|

### [RBI payout to Government](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/24/rbi-payout-to-government/)

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/business/rbi-triples-payout-to-govt-to-transfer-87416-crore-as-surplus/article66871124.ece#:~:text=The%20Central%20Board%20of%20Directors,for%20the%20previous%20fiscal%20year.)

**Context:** The **Reserve Bank of India (RBI)** has **tripled its payout** to the Indian government, deciding to transfer **₹87,416 crores** as surplus for the accounting year 2022-23 (nearly three times the ₹30,307 crores transferred in the previous fiscal year)

- Also, RBI has increased the **Contingency Risk Buffer to 6%, up from 5%** in the previous year.

**About RBI’s surplus transfer to the government:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Aspect**|**Details**|
|**Definition**|RBI’s **surplus transfer to the government** refers to the transfer of excess income over expenditure by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). This transfer is mandated by the **Reserve Bank of India Act of 1934** and is done **annually**.|
|**RBI’s Earning**|Returns earned on **foreign currency assets** (such as bonds, treasury bills) and deposits with other central banks; Interest on holdings of **local rupee-denominated government bonds; Management commission** on handling the borrowings of state governments and the central government.|
|||
|||
|**RBI’s Expenditure**|Printing of currency notes, Commission was given to banks and primary dealers for underwriting borrowings, contingency funds and staff expenses.|
|**Surplus Transfer Policy**|Finalized based on the recommendations of the **Bimal Jalan committee**.|
|**Reasons for the transfer**|**Perception of RBI being overcapitalized** compared to other central banks; The excess capital could be put to **productive use by the government;** Higher **dividends of RBI** from public sector banks and oil marketing companies; **Increased earnings on investments, valuation changes on dollar holdings**, revaluation of forex assets|
|**Implications**|**Helps government in bank recapitalization** during economic slowdown; Enables government to stimulate the economy; Helps meet the fiscal deficit target|
|**About Contingency Risk Buffer**|It refers to a reserve maintained by the RBI to **protect the economy against potential financial stability** crises or unforeseen risks. It serves as a **cushion to absorb any adverse shocks.**<br><br>In view of the RBI’s function as a **lender of last resort,** it needs to maintain some **Contingent Risk Buffer (CRB) to insure** the economy against any tail risk of financial stability crisis. The **Bimal Jalan Committee** recommended that the CRB needs to be maintained at a range of **5.5% to 6.5%** of the RBI’s balance sheet.|
