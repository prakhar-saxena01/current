**India’s strengths:**

- Existing infrastructure, pharmaceutical manufacturing expertise, and **skilled manpower**.
- India is among the **top performers** in the field of biomanufacturing in both the quality of research and research publications.
- India also has **significant potential in low-cost biomanufacturing** (33% lower than the U.S.), particularly in the production of enzymes, reagents, research materials, and equipment.

**Challenges:**

- India **still requires significant capability and capacity uplifts** to become a world leader.
- **China** has expressed its intention to capture this market, similar to how it dominated small-molecule **active pharmaceutical ingredients** (APIs).
- Such dependence on the biomanufacturing sector will be **detrimental to both India and the Quad.**

**How does Quad complement these strengths?**

- **The U.S.** has significant funding capability.
- **Japan, Australia and the U.S.** possess advanced biotechnology innovation ecosystems and intellectual property.

**Advantages of the proposed hub for India and Quad:**

- Can help facilitate technology transfer,
- Connect investors,
- Establish a biomanufacturing fund that is administered through the Quad,
- Support efforts to reduce dependency on China.

**Way ahead for India:**

- **Strengthening physical infrastructure.**
- **A scheme** on the line the PLI scheme allocated $2 billion to the pharmaceutical sector to make biopharmaceuticals, APIs, etc.
- **Boosting the workforce** by enabling access to cutting-edge technology and training, with a focus on commercialising R&D.

**Conclusion:**

- The proposed hub in India can **capitalise on the economic potential** of the biomanufacturing industry and **address existing and potential vulnerabilities** in the global system.
- **Through cross-Quad collaboration**, India may emerge as a major force in the field of biomanufacturing and assist the Quad in competing in this key area.

**Context:** According to a new study, **only 13% of** [**methane emissions**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/05/08/un-report-on-human-caused-methane-emissions/) **are covered by global methane mitigation policies.**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|

|**Global**|**India**||
|[**Global Methane Pledge**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/11/08/what-is-the-global-methane-pledge/) **–** Both the US and the EU have planned to cut methane emissions by 30% (by 2030) compared with the 2020 levels.|According to the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, a nationwide strategy **to boost biogas production** has received significant funding**.**||
|**UNEP’s International Methane Emissions Observatory (IMEO**) strategy – To get policy-relevant data into the right hands for emissions mitigation.|**ICAR’s National Innovations in Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) project:** Technologies (like System for Rice Intensification, Direct Seeded Rice) were developed to reduce methane emissions.||
|**Methane Alert and Response System (MARS) –** Launched at the COP27 to the UNFCCC in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt|**Crop Diversification Programme:** Methane emissions are avoided due to the diversion of paddy to alternate crops like pulses, oilseeds, maize, cotton, and agro-forestry.||

**Highlights of the study:**

- Since the 1980s, the rate of increase in methane emissions is **higher than ever before.**
- **Methane policies are actions by governments** that explicitly aim to monitor, prevent, or reduce methane emissions from anthropogenic sources.
- 90% of identified national policies were from three regions: North America, Europe and Asia Pacific.
- **The policies targeting fossil methane** (coal, oil, and gas) are lower than biogenic methane (released by living organisms).

**Concerns:**

- This trend has emerged **despite readily available solutions to cut methane emissions** from the fossil fuel sector.
- **Impact of methane mitigation policies on industries** (like agriculture) important to the national economy, energy and food security or rural poverty considerations.

**India-specific findings:**

- **No effective policies** targeting methane emissions from rice cultivation and biomass burning (burning of crop residues).
- While policies targeting biomass burning have quite broad coverage, their **implementation remains challenging.**
    - **For example,** the 1997 Coalbed methane policy was ineffective in incentivising coalbed methane production.

**Way ahead:**

- The policies should focus on **super emitters**, which are facilities, equipment, and other infrastructure, typically in the fossil-fuel, waste, or agriculture sectors, that emit methane at high rates.
- While reducing livestock or rice-production-related emissions is challenging, **India can contribute by reducing emissions associated with coal production.**

**Context:** A recent peer-reviewed study suggests that even low levels of [arsenic consumption](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/05/06/arsenic-contamination/), commonly found in contaminated groundwater in India, can impact cognitive function in children, adolescents, and young adults.

**What does the study say:**

- **Arsenic exposure** leads to **reduced grey matter in the brain**, affecting concentration, information storage, and switching between tasks.
- **At the population level**, contamination leads to **increased school failures**, diminished economic productivity, and a higher risk of criminal and antisocial behaviour.
- **The major factor for contamination**: Arsenic intake from food, primarily through rice consumption; using contaminated groundwater.

**Remedy**: Modifying food preparation techniques, **such as cooking rice** in a specific way, can significantly reduce arsenic levels; **promoting piped water access** and installing arsenic removal plants; **encourage extraction from aquifers** (water channels below the ground) that are deeper than 100 m.

**About Arsenic:**

Arsenic is an **odourless and tasteless metalloid** found naturally in the earth’s crust and groundwater. It is **highly toxic** in its inorganic form and can cause arsenic poisoning. **Arsenicosis**, the accumulation of high levels of arsenic in the body, leads to adverse health effects and can result in **multi-system organ failure and death**. Efforts have been made under the **2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development** to provide safely managed drinking water free of arsenic contamination. **The Jal Jeevan Mission aims** to provide safe drinking water to all households in rural and **urban India by 2024.**

 **Context:** The WHO’s new guidelines advise against the use of non-sugar sweeteners (NSS) as a “healthy” alternative to sugar.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Non-sugar sweeteners (NSS)**|   |
|**Meaning**|They are marketed as **low or no-calorie alternatives to free sugars** which aid in weight loss, and in controlling blood glucose in individuals with diabetes.|
|**Categories**|**Aspartame** (to sweeten diet colas), advantame, cyclamates, neotame, **saccharin** (to sweeten tea or coffee), sucralose, **stevia**, etc.|
|**Rise in Popularity**|In 2015, when WHO said that a **high intake of free sugars is linked to weight gain and obesity.**|
|**WHO’s new guidelines?**|NSS **should not be used as a means of achieving weight control** or reducing the risk of diet-related non-communicable diseases. Long-term use of NSS could lead to **increased risk of Type 2 diabetes**, cardiovascular diseases, chronic kidney disease and cancer.|
|**Concerns for India**|**One in 9 women and one in 25 men are obese** (NFHS5), and an **estimated 25 million people** living with pre-diabetes in India (WHO).|
|**WHO’s nutritional advice**|**Having alternative foods** which are minimally processed, unsweetened foods and beverages.|

### [Calcium-41](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/22/calcium-41/)

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/calcium-41-radiometric-dating-atom-trap-trace-analysis-china/article66853060.ece)

 **Context:** A recent study has proposed **using calcium-41** as a new method for radiometric dating, similar to **carbon-14 dating** but with several advantages.

**What is radiocarbon dating?**

Radiocarbon dating, **also known as carbon-14 dating**, is a method used to determine the **age of organic materials** that originated from living organisms. It relies on the **radioactive isotope carbon-14**, which is a variant of the **element carbon**. Carbon-14 is unstable and undergoes radioactive decay over time.

**Limitations of Carbon-14 dating:**

- **Limited Time Range:** Carbon-14 dating is effective for objects up to approximately 50,000 years old due to the short half-life of carbon-14 (5,700 years).
- **Contamination Issues:** Contamination from modern carbon sources can affect the accuracy of carbon-14 dating, leading to inaccurate age estimates.
- **Incomplete Preservation**: Organic materials must be well-preserved to contain sufficient carbon-14 for dating. Poor preservation or exposure to environmental factors can compromise the reliability of carbon-14 dating.

**Advantages of Calcium-41:**

- **Longer Half-Life:** Calcium-41 has a **much longer half-life of 99,400 years**, allowing for the dating of much older materials compared to carbon-14.
- **Abundance in Earth’s Crust**: Calcium-41 is found in the Earth’s crust, making it available for dating various geological materials, including fossilized bones and rocks.
- **Atom Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA):** The technique of ATTA enables the detection of **calcium-41 atoms with high sensitivity** and selectivity, improving the accuracy of dating methods.
- **Potential for Extension**: The successful application of ATTA to calcium-41 opens the possibility of **using similar techniques for other metal isotopes**, expanding the range of dating methods available.
- **Earth-Science Applications:** Calcium-41 and ATTA can be used to **study geological processes,** such as determining how long rocks have been covered by ice, providing valuable insights into Earth’s history and climate changes.

### [Cold-blooded animals](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/22/cold-blooded-animals/)

#### **Facts for Prelims:**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/european-perch-larger-body-size-warm-water/article66873491.ece#:~:text=Scientists%20have%20called%20into%20question,water%20heated%20by%20warm%20pollutants.)

**Context:** Scientists have disputed the idea that as the planet warms, the bodies of cold-blooded marine species, including fish, will contract.

**Conventional understanding**: Warming temperatures lead to smaller body sizes in cold-blooded marine animals, suggesting that they may actually grow larger in response to warmer waters.

**The recent study challenges the expectation due to several reasons:**

- **Warm water pollution**: The study suggests that warm water pollution, caused by the discharge of warm pollutants, can actually contribute to **the growth of aquatic animals**.
- **Accelerated growth at younger age:** Contrary to previous assumptions, the study found that cold-blooded animals, or ectotherms, experience faster growth at a younger age in warm waters.
- **Sustained growth throughout life:** The study discovered the positive effect of warmer waters on growth and they continue to experience growth throughout their lives, leading to a larger maximum body size.
- **Survival trade-off:** While the warmer waters provide favourable conditions for growth, they also come with higher death rates.
- **Influence of warm water on young populations**: The research revealed that even if the water becomes inhospitable to the fish due to excessive warmth, the growth boost is significant enough to create a larger population of young-and-large fish.

**Highlights of the study:** Aquatic animals/ectotherms/cold-blooded animals such as fish would actually **grow larger due to warm water pollution**, i.e. water heated by warm pollutants.
