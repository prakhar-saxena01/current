### [India and BRICS](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/01/india-and-brics/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: International Relations**

**Source:** [**TOI**](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/19-countries-express-interest-in-joining-brics-group/articleshow/99756285.cms?from=mdr)

 **Context:** 19 nations including **Saudi Arabia, UAE, Algeria, Egypt, Bahrain, and Iran** have expressed interest in joining the emerging-markets bloc of **BRICS** (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa).

**About BRICS:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Topic**|**Information**|
|**BRICS** (**founded: 2009; HQ: Shanghai)** is an acronym for the grouping of the **world’s leading emerging economies,** namely Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (included in 2010)|   |
|**Origin**|The term “**BRIC”** was coined by the **British Economist Jim O’Neill in 2001** to describe the four emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India, and China.|
|**Share of BRICS**|BRICS brings together five of the largest developing countries, representing **41% of the global population**, **24% of the global GDP**, and **16% of the global trade** (By 2028, BRICS is expected to make **up 35 per cent of the global economy**)|
|**Chairmanship**|The chairmanship of the forum is **rotated annually among** the members, in accordance with the acronym B-R-I-C-S. **South Africa** is the chair for 2023.|
|**Initiatives of BRICS**|1. New Development Bank (NDB) 2. Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA) 3. BRICS Payment System 4. Customs Agreements 5. Remote Sensing Satellite|
|**New Initiative**|BRICS is planning to launch its own **“new currency” system**, a major step towards **de-dollarization (reducing dependence on the US dollar for trade)**|

**Importance of BRICS for India:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Importance**|**Example**|
|**Geo-Politics**|BRICS provides India with an opportunity to **balance its strategic interests between the US and the Russia-China axis.**|
|**Global Economic Order**|BRICS plays an important role in the G20, in **shaping global economic policies** and promoting financial stability.|
|**Voice of Developing Nations**|BRICS has emerged as the **voice of developing countries** and is playing a significant role in protecting the rights of developing countries.|
|**Terrorism**|BRICS provides a platform for India to **galvanize its efforts against terrorism** and has worked within the grouping to take a strong stand against terrorism.|
|**Global Grouping**|BRICS provides an opportunity for India to **actively engage with China and resolve mutual disputes**. It also helps in garnering support from other partner countries.|

**Challenges for BRICS:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Challenge**|**Example**|
|**Economic Divergence**|**Brazil and Russia have been experiencing economic recessions** in recent years, while China and India have sustained high growth rates. **South Africa’s economy** has been performing poorly, with high levels of unemployment and inequality.|
|**Political Differences**|**Russia’s annexation of Crimea and involvement in conflicts in Ukraine and Syria** have strained its relations with other BRICS members. **China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea** have been a source of tension with other BRICS countries that have competing claims in the region.|
|**Institutional Constraints**|The **New Development Bank (NDB**), established by BRICS in 2014 to provide development financing, has **faced challenges in disbursing loans and identifying viable projects**. The **Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA**), a pool of foreign exchange reserves, has not been tested yet.|
|**Coordination Difficulties**|**Disagreements over the governance structure of the NDB and the CRA**, as well as differing priorities in areas such as trade, investment, and climate change, have made it difficult for BRICS to present a unified front on many issues.|
|**External Pressures**|The rise of **protectionism, nationalism, and populism in some advanced economies** has posed challenges for BRICS in terms of trade, investment, and access to capital.|

**Way forward for BRICS:.**

|   |   |
|---|---|
||**Example**|
|**Reform of Multilateral Institutions**|BRICS countries could jointly advocate for the reform of the **UN Security Council**, calling for the inclusion of more developing countries as permanent members.|
|**Resolve to Combat Terrorism**|BRICS countries could **share best practices and intelligence** to combat terrorism, as well as work together to cut off funding and resources for terrorist groups.|
|**Promoting Technological and Digital Solutions for the SDGs**|BRICS countries could **share their experiences in adopting and implementing digital solutions** in these sectors|
|**Expanding People-to-People Cooperation**|BRICS countries could **organize joint cultural events and exhibitions, establish more student exchange programs** and scholarships, and encourage more tourism and business visits to each other’s countries.|

**Conclusion:**

BRICS faces **several challenges such as internal differences, global economic slowdown, and geopolitical tensions**. However, the group can remain relevant by expanding its agenda to promote comprehensive development and enhanced cooperation among all states. BRICS should also focus on the democratization of international issues, respect for cultural diversity, and peaceful resolution of conflicts.

### [Labour Day](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/01/labour-day/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Government Policies and Interventions for Development in various sectors and Issues arising out of their Design and Implementation**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/tread-a-new-path-one-that-prioritises-social-justice/article66797405.ece)

 **Context:** May 1 is widely known as Labour Day/International Worker’s Day – a day to celebrate the contribution of workers worldwide.

**Background:**

- The origin of Labour Day dates back to the **19th century –** when a nationwide strike of **1886** for an **eight-hour workday** culminated in a violent movement in **Chicago, US.**
- **In 1889,** the International Socialist Conference declared May 1 would be an international holiday for labour/May Day/Labour Day/Workers Day.
- **In India**, the first Labour Day (initiated by the Labour Kisan Party of Hindustan) was celebrated on **May 1, 1923, in Madras.**

**The primary objective of Labour Day:**

- To acknowledge the hard work and dedication of the working class,
- **Create awareness about their rights**, and
- Protect them from exploitation.

**Current trends in the labour market worldwide:** Three years after the COVID-19,

- Small and micro-enterprises/people have been hard hit by **inflation**
- Lack of opportunities
- **Real wages have fallen**, and poverty inequality is rising

**Indian labour market – Major issues:**

- **Surplus labour force**: Without the commensurate rise in job opportunities in the labour market.
- **Unskilled labour force:** Leading to a rise in indecent/poor quality jobs like manual scavenging, etc.
    - **For example,** 8 people died in Gujarat (in April 2023) while cleaning sewers, despite the practice being declared illegal across the country.
- Low absorption of skilled labour
- **Labour market imperfections:** Such as lack of adequate information regarding jobs, **numerous labour laws**, etc.
- **The workers in the unorganised sector:** Constitute about **93%** of the total workforce in the country → not covered under social security measures → most affected during COVID-19 pandemic.
- **Unemployment:** Causing problems like disguised unemployment, seasonal unemployment, open unemployment and educated unemployment.
- **Son of the soil doctrine:** For example, Haryana enacted a new law reserving 75% of private sector jobs with monthly salaries up to ₹30,000 for locals.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Labour reforms**|   |
|**Global**|**The International Labour Organization (ILO)** is a UN agency to advance social and economic justice by setting international labour standards.<br><br>In 1919, the ILO adopted the **Hours of Work (Industry) Convention** (British India ratified in 1921), limiting the number of working hours to eight a day and 48 hours a week.<br><br>**The Declaration of Philadelphia** (1944) restated the traditional objectives of the ILO and highlighted two new directions: **the centrality of human rights to social policy, and the need for international economic planning.**|
|**India**|Labour falls under the **Concurrent List** of the Constitution.<br><br>The central government replaced the **29 existing labour laws** with **four Codes.**<br><br>**These Codes regulate** (i) Wages, (ii) Industrial Relations, (iii) Social Security, and (iv) Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions.<br><br>**eShram:** This portal will help build a comprehensive National Database of Unorganised Workers (NDUW) in the country.<br><br>**PM Shram Yogi Maan-dhan (PM-SYM):** Meant for old age protection and social security of Unorganised workers.<br><br>**Aam Admi Bima Yojana:** Providing social security to unorganised sector workers.|

**How to prioritise social justice for a sustainable and stable future?**

- **Policies and actions must be human-centred**.
- **Focusing on ‘decent work’:** The most effective way to reduce inequality, and poverty and ensure social protection is a ‘Decent Work for All’ – **SDG 8.**
- **Addressing the long-term structural transformations:** By ensuring that **new technology creates and supports employment**, and skills training, treating demographic changes/migration as a ‘dividend’.
- **Reinvigorate labour institutions and organisations:** To make social dialogue effective and vigorous.
- **Review laws and regulations**: To make them up-to-date – protecting workers and supporting sustainable businesses.
- **Creating a global platform:** To recommit to international cooperation and solidarity and to create greater policy coherence, **a Global Coalition for Social Justice** is needed.

**Conclusion:** Social justice should be the keystone of labour reforms at the level of national, regional and global policies and actions. This will help in achieving equitable and resilient societies.

### [Gig economy](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/01/gig-economy/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus:** **Indian Economy and related issues**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/explained-blinkit-protests-and-the-legal-remedies-available-to-gig-workers/article66784224.ece)

 **Context:** The recent strike by Zomato-owned Blinkit delivery agents has once again brought to the forefront the issues plaguing the gig economy in the country.

**Background:** The strikes began when Blinkit slashed the **minimum payout per delivery to Rs 15 per delivery** from Rs 25.

**The gig economy in India:**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/giga_eco.png)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/giga_eco.png)

- According to the NITI Aayog estimates, **nearly 23.5 million workers** will be engaged in the gig economy by **2029**.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Gig worker**|   |
|Gig workers refer to workers outside of the traditional employer-employee relationship. There are two groups of gig workers – platform workers and non-platform workers.|   |
|**Platform workers**|**Non-platform workers**|
|When gig workers use online algorithmic matching platforms or apps to connect with customers, they are called platform workers.|Those who work outside of these platforms are non-platform workers, including construction workers and non-technology-based temporary workers.|

**Issues faced by gig workers:**

- Since the gig economy **falls outside the scope of traditional, full-time employment**, gig workers usually **lack basic employment rights** such as
    - Minimum wages,
    - Overtime pay,
    - Medical leave, and
    - A statutorily bound resolution of employer-employee disputes.
- Whether gig workers should be categorised as **‘employees’ or as ‘independent contractors’**?
- It depends on the **extent of control and supervision exercised by the employer** and the **integration of the worker with the organisation**.
    - **In India**, employees are entitled to a host of benefits under the Minimum Wages Act 1948, EPF Act 1952 and the Payment of Bonus Act 1965.
    - Similarly, **contract labourers** are governed under the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act 1970 and are entitled to benefits under the EPF.
    - However, gig workers display **characteristics of both employees and independent contractors** → as a result fall outside the ambit of statutory benefits.

**What is the proposed law for gig workers?** In keeping with the National Commission on Labour’s recommendation to consolidate central labour laws, the Ministry of Labour and Employment introduced **the Code on Social Security 2020.**

**Salient provisions in the Code on Social Security 2020:**

- It brings gig workers within the ­ambit of labour laws for the first time.
- I**t distinguishes between such workers and employees**.
- It stipulates that Central and State Governments **must frame suitable social security schemes for gig workers**.
- A **social security fund** for gig workers, to which Gig employers must contribute 1-2% of their annual turnover → **to be used for the aforementioned schemes.**
- It also mandates the **compulsory registration of all gig workers** to avail of benefits under these schemes.
- It also envisages the constitution of a **National Social Security Board** by the Central government to monitor the implementation of such schemes.

**Concerns:**

- Out of the four new labour codes proposed, **gig work finds reference only in the Code on Social Security**.
- Hence, they **cannot create legally recognised unions and access a national minimum wage** that applies to all forms of employment.
- Gig workers are excluded from the category of ‘unorganised workers’ or ‘wage workers’.
- Gig workers also remain **excluded from accessing the specialised redressal mechanism** against their employers.
- They also do not have the **right to collective bargaining** – a fundamental principle of modern labour law.
- All the above leads to the violation of their fundamental rights under **Articles 14 and 21** and comes within the meaning of **forced labour under Article 23.**

**Can judicial intervention be expected?** A petition demanding that **gig workers or platform workers be declared as ‘unorganised workers’** so that they come under the purview of the Unorganised Workers’ Social Security Act, 2008, is pending in the SC of India.

**Best practices:**

- In 2021, the **UK Supreme Court** classified Uber drivers as ‘workers’ under the UK Employment Rights Act 1996.
- **Germany’s** Temporary Employment Act provides for equal pay and equal treatment of gig workers.
- **Singapore** has also proposed legislative changes to extend work injury insurance and pension coverage to such workers.

**Way ahead for India:**

- The Labour Codes need to be implemented as soon as possible.
- For this, State governments should frame rules as soon as possible.
