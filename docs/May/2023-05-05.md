### [El Niño likely to bring extreme weather across the world](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/05/el-nino-likely-to-bring-extreme-weather-across-the-world/)

#### **GS Paper 1**

 **Syllabus:** **Important Geophysical Phenomena**

**Source:** [**HT**](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/world-meteorological-organisation-warns-of-el-ni-o-s-development-associated-with-severe-droughts-and-extreme-rain-globally-by-2024-101683138629803.html)

 **Context:** According to the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), the world should prepare for the development of [El Niño](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/15/el-nino-and-monsoon/), which is often associated with **increased heat, drought or rainfall** in different parts of the world**.**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/How-the-2015-16-El-Nino-affected-disease-outbreaks.jpg)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/How-the-2015-16-El-Nino-affected-disease-outbreaks.jpg)

**Background:**

- [**La Niña**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/15/el-nino-and-monsoon/) has now ended after persisting for three years and the tropical Pacific is currently in an **ENSO-neutral state** (neither El Niño nor La Niña).
- There is a **60% chance for a transition from ENSO-neutral to El Niño** during May-July 2023.
- **2016** was the warmest year on record because of the **confluence of a very powerful El Niño event and global warming.**

**The typical impacts of El Niño include:**

- **Increased rainfall** in parts of southern South America, the southern US, the Horn of Africa and central Asia.
- **Severe droughts** over Australia, Indonesia, and parts of southern Asia.
- **Warm water** during summer in the northern hemisphere can fuel **hurricanes** in the central/eastern Pacific Ocean and can **hinder hurricane formation in the Atlantic Basin.**

**Potential threats due to an El Niño event:**

- **A new spike in global heating** will increase the chance of breaking temperature records (in 2024).
- **50:50 chance** of the global temperature **temporarily reaching 1.5°C** above the pre-industrial era.

**Likely impact on India:**

- Normally, El Nino is **good for the northeast monsoon** [Oct-Dec in the peninsular region] but **bad for the southwest monsoon** (dry periods during June-Sept).
- **The monsoon season** (~70% of India’s annual rainfall) is crucial to India’s agriculture – a lifeline for about 60% of the country’s net cultivated area.
- Monsoon **drives farm produce, rural spending**, inflation, jobs, and industrial demand.
- Good farm output **checks food inflation, raises rural incomes and helps inject demand** into the economy.

**Challenge ahead for India:**

- IMD forecasted a “**normal**” monsoon at 96% (+/-5%) of the long-period average (LPA is 87 cm for the period of 1971 to 2020).
- An unusually cold start to summer **could delay the start of the monsoon season.**

**Way ahead – EW4All:**

- The Early Warnings For All Initiative (EW4All) was formally launched by the UN Secretary-General in November 2022 at the **COP27** meeting in Sharm El-Sheikh.
- The Initiative calls for the **whole world to be covered by an early warning system by the end of 2027.**

### [SAI20: Blueprint for a blue economy](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/05/sai20-blueprint-for-a-blue-economy/)  

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus:** **Indian Economy and related issues/Environment, Conservation**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/indias-cag-writes-blueprint-for-a-blue-economy-8590303/)

 **Context:** The Comptroller & Auditor General of India (CAG) will chair **SAI20** – the Engagement Group for Supreme Audit Institutions (SAls) of G20 countries in Goa.

**What is SAI20?**

- The SAI20 Engagement Group of G20 was **established in 2022 during Indonesia’s Presidency of the G20.**
- The constitution of SAI20 stems from a recognition of the role of SAIs in –
    - Promoting the **efficiency, accountability, and transparency of public administration**, and supporting SDG implementation.
    - **Promoting intergenerational equity** and addressing climate change concerns.

**Meaning of blue economy and its significance:**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/blue.png)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/blue.png)

- The global annual value of the blue/ocean economy is **~$2.5 trillion**.
- **About 90% of global trade by volume** [75% by value] is carried out through sea routes.

**Efforts to promote blue economy:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Global**|**India**|
|**Sustainable Blue Economy Finance Principles (2018):** Laid out by the UNEP, the framework can be used by **Investors** to fund ocean-based industries and **Financiers** to see how marine investment can impact livelihood and poverty eradication.|The blue economy is **one of the 10 core sectors** for national growth in India.|
|**COP15 (CBD):** It laid out the global biodiversity framework to conserve and sustainably use the planet’s biodiversity.|**A National Blue Economy Policy** that aims to harness maritime resources while preserving the country’s rich marine biodiversity has been prepared by the Ministry of Earth Sciences.|
|**Compendium of Asset Accounts of Natural Resources:** This first-ever country-wide handbook (by CAG) sets a national accounting framework for the blue economy.|
|**Conservation of Coastal Ecosystem report by CAG:** The audit resulted in focused recommendations to help improve the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) ecosystem.|

**Challenges:**

- **The measurement of the blue economy** is challenging due to conflicting definitions and issues while classifying different sectors and sub-sectors.
- **Climate change:** Sea-level rise, water temperature, storm surges, cyclones and wave conditions are some of the signs.
- **Land use changes, sand mining and deforestation** impinge on the coastal ecosystem.

**In the context of India,**

- **~15% of India’s coastal areas** have witnessed changes between 1992 and 2018 due to agriculture, depleting forest cover and urbanisation.
- **The population** living in the country’s coastal areas is expected to rise from 64 million in 2000 to 216 million by 2060.

**Two priorities for SAI20 deliberations:** _Blue economy_ and responsible Artificial Intelligence (AI).

**What is expected in the blue economy deliberations?**

- **Preparation of technology-driven tools** to assess authorised development in coastal stretches and track marine water quality.
- **Evolution of globally relevant audit toolkits** for coastal spaces, which include –
    - Legal and institutional frameworks,
    - Compliance with coastal regulations,
    - Biodiversity conservation,
    - Capacity building and compliance to SDGs.

**Way ahead:**

- Disaster-resilient infrastructure along coasts
- ICT hubs for early warning systems
- The SAI20 audit **toolkits** being prepared under the leadership of the CAG of India will provide a unique opportunity for constructive dialogue to improve the auditing of ocean-based activities.

**Conclusion:** The audit toolkits will help in the **assessment of policy goals**, and resource efficiency while leveraging economic opportunities towards a truly sustainable blue economy-based global development model.

**Source: TH**

The regulation of artificial intelligence (AI) is a challenging issue because it is rooted in two problems: the pacing problem and the Collingridge dilemma.

**Explanations:**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
||**Pacing Problem**|**Collingridge Dilemma**|
|**Definition**|The difficulty of predicting the **long-term impacts of a technology** when it is introduced quickly and widely.|The difficulty of **controlling the development and use of a technology once** it has been widely adopted.|
|**Example**|The widespread **adoption of social media** without considering the long-term effects on mental health and society.|The development and **use of fossil fuels,** which have had a significant impact on the environment and climate change.|

### [Issues in Manipur](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/05/issues-in-manipur/)

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/manipur-clashes-meitei-scheduled-tribe-explained-8591158/)

 **Context:** The recent violent clashes in **Manipur are due to longstanding tensions** between hill and valley people, the Meitei demand for ST (Scheduled Tribe) status, and a recent order by the Manipur High Court.

**Summary of the issues:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Issue**|**Explanation**|
|**Hill-Valley Tensions**|The central valley of Manipur (10% of the geographical area) is home to the **Meitei and Meitei Pangals** who constitute roughly **64% of the state’s population**.<br><br>The remaining **90% of the state’s geographical area** comprises hills surrounding the valley, which are home to the recognized tribes, making up about **35% of the state’s population**.<br><br>[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/imphal.jpg)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/imphal.jpg)|
|**Meitei Demand for ST Status**|The **Meitei community (living in the valley) wants to be included** in the **state’s Scheduled Tribes list**. The demand has been led by the Scheduled Tribes Demand Committee of Manipur (STDCM) since 2012. They argue that being left out of the ST list has caused the community to be **victimized without any constitutional safeguards**.|
|**Manipur High Court Order**|A single judge of the **Manipur High Court** passed an order asking the government to consider the **demand of the Meitei community for ST status**. The order has been opposed by tribal groups in the state.|
|**The opposition**|Both the demand and the order, passed by a single judge of the High Court, have been strongly opposed by groups **representing the state’s tribal communities such as  Kukis and Naga (living in Hills)**|
|**Reason behind opposition**|Opposition to the inclusion of the **Meiteis in the Scheduled Tribe (ST)** category by hill tribe in Manipur is due to their **dominant population and political representation** of Meitei (40 out of 60 Assembly constituencies of the state are in the valley), and fear of job loss. Additionally, the **Meitei language is already included in the Constitution**, and sections of the Meitei community are already classified as **Scheduled Castes or Other Backward Classes** with access to opportunities associated with that status.|

**Context:**  India may soon join the ranks of cities and countries such as Singapore, Yingtan in China, Dubai, Saudi Arabia, etc. that have built digital twins to **enhance their efficiency, coordination and governance.**

**About digital twins:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|It is a **three-dimensional (3D) virtual representation** of a city or system that provides real-time insights into the performance, operation, or profitability of a city. For example, let’s say a city government wants to develop **a new transport system**. By creating a digital twin of the city, they can **simulate the transport system** and see how it will function in real-world conditions.|   |
|**Purpose**|To improve **efficiency, coordination, and governance** of cities. E.g., digital twins can be used to **optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion**, improve the efficiency of public transportation systems, manage energy consumption, monitor air and water quality, and identify areas that are vulnerable to natural disasters.|
|**Benefits**|Enables better planning of infrastructure at lower costs. Can support climate-smart cities or green infrastructure. Can improve healthcare, education, agriculture, and other areas|
|**Challenges**|Requires large amounts of data collection and processing. Can be costly and time-consuming to develop. Requires expertise in data analysis and 3D modelling|
|**Future potential**|Could revolutionize the way we plan and manage cities.  Could improve the quality of life for urban residents. This could lead to more sustainable and efficient use of resources|

**About ICAO**

The International Civil Aviation Organization (est. 1944; HQ: Montreal, Canada) is a **specialized agency of the United Nations** that coordinates the principles and techniques of international air navigation and fosters the planning and development of international air transport to ensure safe and orderly growth.

**It has adopted ambitious goals of**: 2% annual fuel efficiency improvement through 2050; carbon neutral growth and net zero by 2050. The ICAO has clubbed them **under CORSIA and LTAG**.

**About CORSIA:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) is a global scheme established by the ICAO to address the **growth in CO2 emissions from international aviation.**|   |
|**Purpose**|To mitigate the growth of carbon emissions from international aviation by offsetting and reducing emissions|
|**Scope**|Applies **to international flights only**|
|**Timeline**|**Phase 1 (2021-2023)** – voluntary participation by states; **Phase 2 (2024-2026) –** mandatory participation for certain states based on size of their aviation industry; **Phase 3 (2027-2035)** – mandatory participation for all states|
|**Offsetting**|Airlines will **offset their emissions by purchasing credits** from approved carbon offset projects|
|**Criteria for offset projects**|Must meet certain criteria, such as being added to any other efforts to reduce emissions, being verifiable, and not causing harm to local communities or ecosystems|
|**Review process**|The scheme will be **reviewed every three years** to ensure effectiveness and make necessary adjustments|
|**Goals**|CORSIA aims to **achieve carbon-neutral growth** for international aviation from 2020 onward and reduce CO2 emissions from international aviation by **50% by 2050 compared to 2005 levels.**|

**What are Long-Term Aspirational Goals (LTAG)?**

It is an initiative of the ICAO to achieve net-zero carbon emissions from international aviation by 2050. It does not attribute specific obligations or commitments in the form of emissions reduction goals to individual States but each state will contribute within its own national timeframe
