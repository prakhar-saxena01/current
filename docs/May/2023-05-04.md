### [Sexual Harassment in Sports](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/04/sexual-harassment-in-sports/)

**GS Paper 1**

 **Syllabus:** Indian Society: Social Empowerment

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/not-just-wrestling-half-of-national-sports-federations-dont-have-sexual-harassment-panel-mandated-by-law-8590204/)

**Context:** An investigation has revealed that as **many as 16 out of 30 national sports federations in India** don’t comply with the **Prevention of Sexual Harassment (PoSH) Act,** which mandates an **Internal Complaints Committee (ICC)** to create a safe workplace environment for women.

**What is Internal Complaints Committee?**

The ICC is the **first port of call for any grievance** under the PoSH Act, and it needs to have a **minimum of four members** with at **least half of them women** and **one external member**, preferably from an **NGO or an association** that works for women’s empowerment or a person familiar with issues related to sexual harassment, like a lawyer.

**Status of various federations on ICC:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Federation**|**ICC Status**|
|Gymnastics Federation of India, Table Tennis Federation, Handball Federation, Wrestling Federation, Volleyball Federation,|**No ICC**|
|Judo Federation of India, Squash Rackets Federation, Billiards & Snooker Federation|**ICC has only three members**|
|Badminton Association of India, Archery Association, Basketball Federation, Indian Triathlon Federation|**ICC has no external member**|

**Common issues faced by women in sports:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Issue**|**Examples**|
|**Lack of funding and support**|For example, the **US women’s soccer team** has won more titles than the men’s team **but has been paid less**.|
|**Gender-based discrimination**|Female athletes may face discrimination based on their gender, such as being told they are not as strong or capable as male athletes.<br><br>E.g., Indian sport is characterised by a d**angerous combination of political nexus and male domination** of positions of power.|
|**Sexual harassment and abuse**|Tennis player **Ruchika Girhotra from 1990** dared to raise her voice against the then president of the tennis federation and IG Haryana Police;<br><br>Chinese Tennis **star Peng Shuai** accused former Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli of sexual assault (2018); **USA Gymnastics sexual abuse scandal**|
|**Lack of media coverage**|Women’s sports events are often given less media coverage compared to men’s events, which can limit their visibility and opportunities for sponsorship.|
|**Decreased Quality Training**|Inferior facilities and equipment, lack of quality trained coaches|
|**Stereotyping and objectification**|Female athletes may be objectified and stereotyped based on their **appearance rather than their athletic abilities**.|
|**Social Attitudes and Disfigurement**|Discrimination based on **sexual orientation and gender identity**, negative performance evaluations, and loss of starting position|
|**Ethical Issues**|Some of the ethical issues faced by sexual harassment of women in sports include **abuse of power, violation of trust, infringement of human rights,** and **the creation of hostile and unsafe** environments.|

**Steps needed and those taken to address the issues faced by women in sports:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Step**|**Example**|
|**Education and Awareness**|For instance, the **International Olympic Committee’s (IOC) Athlete365** program offers educational resources on a range of topics including athlete safeguarding.|
|**Policy and guidelines development**|**Sports Authority of India** has issued guidelines that mandate **female coaches to accompany female athletes** during travel.|
|**Reporting and complaint mechanisms**|**Sexual Harassment Electronic Box (SHe-Box)** provides single-window access for women to register their complaints of sexual harassment.|
|**Accountability and enforcement**|**National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)** issued notices to the Union Youth Affairs and Sports Ministry and the Sports Authority of India on the reported inappropriate behaviour of a coach.|
|**Support and empowerment**|Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports launched the **Khelo India Scheme** in 2018 to promote sports at the grassroots level, with a special focus on encouraging the participation of girls.|

**Major Provisions of POSH Act 2013**

|   |   |
|---|---|
||**Description**|
|**Sexual harassment defined**|Sexual harassment includes **“any one or more**” of the following “unwelcome acts or behaviour” committed directly or by implication: **Physical contact and advances**, a demand or request for sexual favours, sexually coloured remarks, showing pornography, any other unwelcome physical, verbal, or non-verbal conduct of a sexual nature.|
|**Obligation**|Every employer is required to **constitute an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC)** at each office or branch with 10 or more employees.|

### [Roadmap to energy justice](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/04/259758/)

**GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus:** **Energy, Environment, Conservation**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/hardeep-s-puri-writes-roadmap-to-energy-justice-8586248/)

**Context:** India’s energy strategy is presently recognised as being pragmatic and balanced since it is motivated by assuring energy access, availability, and affordability for its vast population.

**What is energy justice?** Energy justice envisions elements of a global energy system that **fairly distributes both energy services’ benefits and burdens** and can be used as a framework to identify energy injustices.

**Short-term actions towards ensuring energy justice in India:**

- **Massive cuts in excise duty and VAT rates of** petrol and diesel.
- **An export cess** on petrol, diesel and ATF.
- **Windfall tax** on domestically produced petroleum products to prevent refiners and producers from profiteering at the cost of domestic consumers.
- **Subsidised administered pricing mechanism** (APM) gas for the city gas distribution sector was drastically increased.
- **R**[**evising the New Domestic Gas Pricing Guidelines 2014**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/10/changes-in-the-domestic-gas-pricing-formula/) to rationalise and reform [APM](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/10/changes-in-the-domestic-gas-pricing-formula/) gas pricing.

**Outcome:**

- **Prices of diesel in India have gone down in the last year:** This is when petrol and diesel prices went up by 35-40% in global markets, India imports over 85% of its crude oil requirements and 55% of its natural gas requirements.
- **No shortage of fuel anywhere in India:** This is when several neighbourhood countries have had dry outs and power cuts to manage demand.

**Long-term actions towards ensuring energy justice:**

1. **Expanding the network of crude oil suppliers:** This strategic decision not only ensured affordable energy for Indian consumers but also had a calming effect on global petroleum markets.

2. **Strengthening ties:** With countries like the US (energy trade has gone up 13 times in the last four years) and Russia to ensure a reliable supply of crude oil.

**Expanding petrochemical production**:

- India is a global exporter of petroleum products and its r**efining capacity is the fourth largest** in the world after the US, China, and Russia.
- Efforts are underway to further enhance this capacity to 450 MMT by 2040.

3. **Innovation and investments in exploration and production (E&P): India wants to boost its net geographic area** under exploration from 8% to 15% (**0.5** million sq km) by 2025 and has reduced the prohibited/no-go areas in EEZ by 99%.

4. **Energy transition:** However, as demonstrated at Glasgow, India is committed to becoming **net-zero in emissions by 2070**.

5. **Moving towards a gas-based economy:**

- By increasing the share of gas from the current **3** to 15% by 2030.
- India has connected **more than 9.5 crore families** with clean cooking fuel in the past nine years.
- **PNG connections** have increased from **28** lakh in 2014 to over 1 crore in 2023.
- **The number of CNG stations** in India has gone up from 938 in 2014 to 4,900 in 2023.
- Since 2014, India has increased the **length of its gas pipeline network** from 14,700 km to 22,000 km in 2023.

6. **Biofuel revolution:**

- At the recent India Energy Week 2023, India launched **E20** – 20% ethanol blended gasoline – which will be expanded across the country in the next two years.
- **India’s ethanol-blending gasoline** has grown from just **53% in 2013-14 to 10.17% in 2023.**
- India is also setting up **five 2nd generation ethanol plants**, which can convert agricultural waste into biofuel → **reducing pollution** due to stubble burning → **generating income** for farmers.

7. **Developing the entire green hydrogen ecosystem:**

- The Na**tional Green Hydrogen Mission** has been launched with an outlay of Rs 19,744 crore to accelerate India’s efforts towards –
    - 4 MT of annual green hydrogen production and
    - Rs 1 lakh crore of fossil fuel import savings by 2030.

8. **An integrated path for transitioning India’s future mobility pathways:**

- Along with green hydrogen and biofuels, India is also supporting **electric vehicles through a production-linked incentive scheme**.
- **India is targeting the installation of alternative fuel stations** (EV charging/CNG/ LPG/LNG/CBG etc.) at 22,000 retail outlets by May 2024.

**Conclusion:**

- According to IEA estimates, India will account for **~25% of global energy demand growth** between 2020-2040.
- As India aspires to become a $26 trillion economy by 2047, implementing **a unique strategy for ensuring energy security and achieving energy independence** is the need of the hour.

### [Debt-for-climate swaps](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/04/debt-for-climate-swaps/)

**GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus:** **Environment, Conservation**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/world/here-is-all-you-need-to-know-about-debt-for-climate-swaps-88653)

**Context:** In the past decade, debt-for-climate swaps have grown relatively popular among **low- and middle-income countries.**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Debt-for-climate/debt-for-nature swaps**|   |
|**Meaning**|It is a **debt restructuring device** between the creditor and a debtor by which the **former forgoes a portion of the latter’s foreign debt**/provides its debt relief, in return for a **commitment to invest in specific** environmental mitigation and adaptation projects.|
|**Who will be benefitted?**|**Low and middle-income countries,** small island developing states (SIDS).<br><br>Example – **Caribbean SIDS:** The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a 73% drop in international tourist arrivals in 2020, and has aggravated the region’s debt crisis.|
|**Need**|These countries are most vulnerable to climate change and are **least able to afford the investment to strengthen resilience** due to their debt burden.<br><br>The signatories to the **Paris Agreement and the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero** (GFANZ) have a commitment to provide financial assistance to developing countries to build clean, climate-resilient futures.|
|**Advantages**|**Dual objectives:** to promote specific investment and policy action (that aims to combat climate change) on the one hand and some debt relief on the other.<br><br>**Seeks to free up fiscal resources** → Governments can improve resilience without triggering a fiscal crisis or sacrificing spending on other development priorities.<br><br>Developed countries can fulfil their commitments (to support developing countries) through this **attractive and transparent instrument.**|
|**Swap vs condition grants**|**Swap:** Offer debt relief above what is needed to finance the climate investments (net debt relief), leading to a **higher fiscal transfer and the creation of fiscal space.**|
|**Conditional grants:** Cover the cost of an investment and require **economic dislocation** → diversion of resources from planned development programmes.|
|**Successful implementation**<br><br>**(Seychelles)**|In 2017, this small African country announced the successful conclusion of negotiations for a debt-for-adaptation swap under a tripartite model.<br><br>The Nature Conservancy (TNC), a US-based environmental organisation, **bought $22 million of its debt in exchange for a promise to create 13 new marine protected areas.**|
|**Way ahead**|Countries like **Sri Lanka [**ranked as highly vulnerable to climate change catastrophes and also reeling under the sovereign debt crisis] can seek the help of these instruments.|

### [Maoist challenge: Needs political understanding, not securitisation](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/04/maoist-challenge-needs-political-understanding-not-securitisation/)

**GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus:** **Linkages between Development and Spread of Extremism**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/maoist-challenge-needs-political-understanding-not-over-reliance-on-security-8590318/lite/)

**Context:** The efficacy of the Maoist movement needs to be gauged in terms of their declining social base, not on the basis of how many violent incidents occur.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|[**Maoist movement in India**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/27/left-wing-extremism-lwe/#:~:text=The%20left%2Dwing%20extremism%20(LWE,Chinese%20political%20leader%20Mao%20Zedong.)|   |   |
|**Current approach**|**Expected outcome**|**Issues**|
|**Use of Force**|The use of force (including specially-trained forces such as the Greyhounds) has led to a **decline in Maoist presence and the use of more force will end its remaining influence**.|The use of more force **only helped the Maoists recruit** from the local tribal population.<br><br>The Maoist movement moved from the leadership of outsiders (mostly from Telangana) to that of **local tribals.**<br><br>**Such internal changes** led to **local support for the movement** from tribals in Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand.|
|**Development**|Welfare and development as part of the “strategy” to calm down and make the Maoists irrelevant.|**The D Bandyopadhyay Committee** (2006) stated that land alienation and poverty among STs and Dalits, and lack of access to basic forest resources contributed to the growth of Naxalism.<br><br>The state’s model of development has resulted in the **displacement of tribals** → leading to the peaceful Pathalgarhi movement in Jharkhand|

**What led to the failure of the above approaches:**

- Declining Maoist presence/violence could well be **a political strategy of the Maoists to go silent/underground** and wait for lapses on the part of the security forces.
- **Eminent Domain doctrine,** argues that all resources belong to the nation and can be extracted in the “national interest”.
- Development is seen as a **zero-sum game** by either side leads.
- **A single conception of development** to address the various, occasionally incompatible demands of oppressed groups.
- **The securitisation paradigm** is also insufficient to comprehend social exclusion.

**Conclusion:**

- Both Ambedkar and Gandhi were of the view that social exclusion and caste cannot be addressed through violence.
- To end the social exclusion of tribals there is the need to understand that development is a **multi-faceted process**.

**Context:** India has slipped in the **World Press Freedom Index** 2023 rankings, coming in at **161 out of 180 countries**, indicating a decline in press freedom.

**About the Press Freedom Index**

|   |   |
|---|---|
||**Description**|
|**World Press Freedom Day**|Celebrated every year on May 3rd, to raise awareness about the state of press freedom globally|
|**Origin**|It was proclaimed by the **UN General Assembly in 1993**. 2023 marks the **30th anniversary of World Press Freedom Day** (and the 1991 Windhoek Declaration adopted by UNESCO)|
|**Windhoek Declaration**|It is a statement of principles related to **independent, pluralistic, and free press**. It was adopted on May 3, 1991, in Windhoek, Namibia.|
|**The theme for this year**|“**Shaping a Future of Rights**: freedom of expression as a driver for all other human rights”|
|**World Press Freedom Index**|It is published every year since 2002 by **Reporters Without Borders** (an independent NGO based in Paris).|
|**Scoring Criteria**|Each country or territory’s score is evaluated using **five contextual indicators**:<br><br>·        Political context<br><br>·        Legal framework<br><br>·        Economic context<br><br>·        Sociocultural context<br><br>·        Safety<br><br>**100 is the highest possible level of press freedom, and 0 is the worst**|
|**Freedom of Press in India**|Freedom of the press is not expressly protected by the Indian legal system but is impliedly protected under **Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution.** However, **r**estrictions apply under **Article 19(2)** related to the interests of sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency or morality or in relation to contempt of court, defamation or incitement to an offence.|
|**Observations of the report this year**|India’s press freedom has gone from “**problematic” to “very bad**,” with the country slipping 11 ranks to 161 out of 180 countries.|
|**Reasons cited for the decline**|Media takeovers by “oligarchs” close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi that have jeopardized pluralism|

**What are Listeria monocytogenes bacteria?**

Listeria monocytogenes is a type of bacteria that can cause infection in humans and animals. It is commonly found in soil, water, and some animals’ intestines. Listeria is typically spread through contaminated food, particularly ready-to-eat foods such as cooked meats, dairy products, and fresh produce.

**Symptoms**: Symptoms of a Listeria infection can include high temperature, muscle ache or pain, chills, feeling or being sick, and diarrhoea.

**Impact**: Listeriosis, the illness caused by Listeria infection, can lead to serious complications, such as meningitis, sepsis, and miscarriage.

### [Clearing corporations](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/04/clearing-corporations/)

 **Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/derecognition-six-indian-central-counterparties-by-esma-8588951/#:~:text=The%20decision%20to%20derecognise%20Indian,Services%20Centres%20Authority%20(IFSCA).)

**Context:** The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the European Union’s financial markets regulator and supervisor, has **derecognised six Indian central counterparties** (CCPs) from April 30, 2023.

What are **Clearing corporations (CC)?**

CC is an organization associated with an exchange to handle the confirmation, settlement, and delivery of transactions in a prompt and efficient manner.

**Examples of CCs:**

The CCPs are The Clearing Corporation of India (CCIL), Indian Clearing Corporation Ltd (ICCL), NSE Clearing Ltd (NSCCL), Multi Commodity Exchange Clearing (MCXCCL), India International Clearing Corporation (IFSC) Ltd (IICC), and NSE IFSC Clearing Corporation Ltd (NICCL).

**Why has ESMA derecognized Indian CCs?**

The decision to derecognise Indian CCPs came due to **‘no cooperation arrangements’** between ESMA and Indian regulators – the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and the International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA).

**Impact:**

As per the European Market Infrastructure Regulations (EMIR), a CCP in a third country can provide clearing services to European banks only **if it is recognised by ESMA**. With the withdrawal of recognition, these CCPs will **no longer be able to provide services to clearing members** and trading venues established in the EU.

**Government’s stand** – ESMA’s threat is unreasonable since all clearing corporations are well-regulated in India.
