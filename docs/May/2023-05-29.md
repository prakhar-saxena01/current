### [How prosperity fuels dowry demand in India](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/29/how-prosperity-fuels-dowry-demand-in-india/)

#### **GS1/GS2/GS4**

**Syllabus: Indian Society/ Social Justice/Ethics**

**Source:** [**BBC**](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-65682796)

 **Context:** A recent study has revealed that as prosperity and opportunities for men in India have improved, the demand for dowry has increased.

- The researchers examined **more than 74,000 marriages in India** between **1930 and 1999** to examine the evolution of dowry over time.

**Key findings of the study about Dowry in India:**

- **Economic growth perpetuates and boosts the practice of dowry payments** in India
- **As men gain better education and higher-quality jobs**, dowry amounts increase.
- **Dowry payments decrease** as more women receive education in an area.
- **Promoting women’s education and increasing their participation in the workforce** can potentially help reduce the prevalence of dowry.
- **Families refusing to pay dowry may end up** with **lower-quality grooms** for their daughters, creating a strong economic incentive for grooms to accept dowry.
- **No correlation with caste-based factors:** The practice of dowry began around the same time for both high and low-caste groups, indicating that caste-based factors do not solely explain its rise.

**Status of Marriages in India:**

- **Most Indian marriages are still arranged**, and nearly all women marry by their late twenties.
- **Some 90% of the marriages** studied until 1999 involved dowry
- **Nearly all marriages** in India are **monogamous**
- **Less than 1%** end in divorce
- **Parents play an important** role in choosing the bride/groom
- **Over 90% of couples live** with the husband’s family after marriage
- **More than 85% of women marry** someone from outside their own village
- **Over 78% of marriages** are within the same district

**What is the Dowry system in India?** 

The dowry system in India refers to the **bride’s family giving to the bridegroom**, his parents, or his relatives as a condition of the marriage.

**Causes of the prevalence of the dowry system in India:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Causes**|**Description**|
|**Patriarchal Society**|Women are considered as economic burdens and need to be financially supported.|
|**Economic Factors**|Dowry is seen as a way to provide financial security to the bride after marriage.|
|**Social Pressure and Status**|Expectations from the bride’s family to display their social and economic status.|
|**Gender Inequality**|Unequal distribution of property and inheritance rights favouring male heirs.|
|**Cultural and Traditional Beliefs**|Deep-rooted customs and traditions have perpetuated the practice of dowry.|
|**Fear of Social Stigma**|Concerns about societal judgment and reputation if dowry is not provided.|
|**Lack of Legal Enforcement**|Inadequate implementation and enforcement of laws against dowry.|
|**Lack of Education and Awareness**|Limited awareness about gender equality and the negative impacts of dowry.|
|**Desire for Material Gain**|Greed for wealth and material possessions led to demands for dowry.|
|**Peer and Family Pressure**|Pressure from extended family, relatives, and societal expectations.|

**Consequences of the prevalence of the dowry system in India:**

- **Financial Burden** on the Bride’s Family
- **Abuse**: Women are subjected to physical, emotional, and mental abuse if dowry demands are not met.
- **Norms**: Reinforcement of patriarchal norms, treating women as inferior and perpetuating gender-based discrimination.
- **Breakdown of Marriages**: Dowry-related disputes and conflicts often lead to marital discord, separation, and even divorce.
- **Deaths**: Cases of dowry deaths, suicides, and bride burning due to dowry disputes and harassment.
- **Financial dependence:** Women’s lack of financial independence and control over their own resources, leads to dependency on their husbands.
- **Inequality**: Preference for investing in dowry over girls’ education, limiting their opportunities for personal and professional growth.
- **Reinforcement of Harmful Stereotypes**: Dowry perpetuates the notion that women are commodities to be bought, reinforcing harmful stereotypes in society.

**Provisions to combat the prevalence of the dowry system in India:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Provisions**|**Examples**|
|**Legal provisions:**|**Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961** (Prohibits the giving or taking of dowry); **Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC)** (Criminalizes cruelty against married women); **Mandatory requirement to report** dowry-related offences to the police or concerned authorities.|
|**Institutional provisions**|**Family Welfare Committees** (Constitution of committees at district levels to review dowry complaints and provide assistance); Women Helpline Numbers; Sensitization of Law Enforcement Agencies|
|**SC observations**|In **Vishaka vs State of Rajasthan (1997):** SC requested the **Law Commission of India** to take a “**fresh look**” to bring “more teeth” to the law against dowry. Recently, the Supreme Court has held that **Dowry’s death can be presumed if the wife was harassed, mentally and physically** close before her death in the marital home.|
|**Government schemes**|Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao; Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana; Ujjawala Scheme; One Stop Centres (Sakhi); and National Service Scheme (NSS) Special Camping Programmes|
|**NGOs/ CSOs initiative**|·        **Shakti Vahini** is a non-governmental organization working towards the prevention of dowry-related violence and trafficking of women.<br><br>·        **Breakthrough** is an organization that focuses on promoting gender equality and challenging social norms, including the dowry system.<br><br>·        **Maitri is an NGO** that works to empower women and prevent violence against them, including dowry-related issues.<br><br>·        **Women’s Legal Initiative (WLI) is an NGO** that focuses on legal empowerment and access to justice for women.|

**Ethical aspects of dowry in India:**

- **Violation of human rights, gender inequality, and commodification** of women.
- Dowry is considered **unethical as it treats women as commodities**, subjecting them to financial transactions and devaluing their worth.
- **Dowry perpetuates gender discrimination**, where women are seen as burdens and objects of transaction.
- Dowry infringes **upon the principles of equality, dignity, and autonomy**.
- The practice goes against the fundamental values of **respect, fairness, and justic**
- Ethically, dowry is condemned as **it promotes inequality, perpetuates harmful stereotypes**, and undermines the inherent rights and dignity of women.

**Conclusion:**

Educating daughters is a valuable gift that empowers them. Society needs to be aware of the seriousness of crimes related to dowry. Local communities should be engaged through women’s rights education programs. Misuse of dowry provisions should be addressed through laws and safeguards.

### [India’s New Parliament: Need and Significance](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/29/indias-new-parliament-need-and-significance/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus:** **Parliament – Structure, Functioning, Conduct of Business, Powers & Privileges and Issues Arising out of these**

 **Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/indias-new-parliament-and-why-it-is-needed-8632565/)

**Context:**

- In the 75th year of Independence, India’s new Parliament building, embodying the culture, pride and spirit of the entire nation, was recently inaugurated by the PM of India.
- 19 opposition parties boycotted the inauguration event, accusing the central government of sidelining President Droupadi Murmu – the country’s first tribal head of state.

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/parliment.png)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/parliment.png)

**The old Parliament:**

- At the coronation of George V as Emperor of India in **1911**, the announcement of the transfer of the seat of GoI **from Calcutta to the ancient Capital of Delhi** was made.
- **The GoI Act 1919** provided for a bicameral legislature for India and the need for the new was felt.
- The parliament building’s construction took six years (and Rs 83 lakhs) – from 1921 to 1927, and its **circular shape** is believed to be inspired by the **Chausath Yogini temple** at Mitawli village in MP’s Morena district.

**Need for a new Parliament building:**

- **Existing Parliament is old:** The existing Parliament house (which will be converted into a ‘Museum of Democracy’ after the new Parliament becomes operational) is almost a century-old **Heritage Grade-I building,** showing signs of distress and over-utilization.
- **Narrow seating space for MPs:**
    - The present building was never designed to accommodate a bicameral legislature for a full-fledged democracy.
    - **The Central Hall** has seating capacity only for 440 persons and **when the Joint Sessions are held**, the problem of limited seats amplifies.
    - **The number of Lok Sabha seats is likely to increase** significantly from the current 545 after 2026.
- **Distressed infrastructure:** The addition of services like water supply, sewer lines, etc., has led to seepage of water at several places and impacted the aesthetics of the building.
- **Safety concerns:** For example, fire safety, structural safety (Delhi is currently in Seismic Zone-IV), etc.
- **Obsolete communication structures:** Communications infrastructure and technology is antiquated in the existing Parliament, and the acoustics of all the halls need improvement.
- **Inadequate workspace for employees.**

**The new Parliament:**

- It is part of the **Central Vista Project** – the ongoing redevelopment project **to revamp** India’s central administrative area (designed by **Sir Edwin Lutyens and Sir Herbert Baker** during British colonial rule) located near Raisina Hill, New Delhi.
- It is **designed** by Ahmedabad-based HCP Design, Planning and Management under architect **Bimal Patel** and has been built by **Tata Projects Ltd.**

**Main features of the new Parliament building:**

- A “**Platinum-rated Green Building**” with about 65,000 sq m built-up area, which will be **divyang friendly.**
- **The triangular shape** ensures the optimum utilisation of space.
- **A larger Lok Sabha hall** (888 seats) based on the **peacock theme** (India’s national bird) and a larger Rajya Sabha hall (384 seats) based on the **lotus theme** (India’s national flower).
- The Lok Sabha **may accommodate up to 1,272 seats for joint sessions of Parliament.**
- A state-of-the-art **Constitutional Hall** symbolically and physically puts the Indian citizens at the heart of our democracy.
- **A Central Lounge** that will complement the open courtyard (with a banyan – the national tree) will be a place for members to interact with each other.
- **Ultra-modern state-of-the-art** **features** like a digitised voting system, well-engineered acoustics and audiovisual systems in the two chambers.

**Interior decorations:**

- **Murals** depicting maps of ancient India-protected monuments of ASI and UNESCO, etc.
- 3 ceremonial entrance halls with huge **brass images of Mahatma Gandhi**, Chanakya, Gargi, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, B.R. Ambedkar, and the **Chariot Wheel from the Sun Temple at Konark** are on display.
- Reflecting the **cultural diversity of India** in line with the “Made in India” initiative **Tripura’s epitome bamboo wood flooring** and carpets from UP’s Mirzapur embellished the new Parliament.

**Significance of the new Parliament:** Symbol of the vision and aspirations of India, the spirit of change and continuity and will witness the making of India as ‘**Aatmanirbhar Bharat**’.

**Expectations from the new Parliament:**

- The trend of **increasing disruptions and long periods of deadlock** is antithetical to the spirit of Parliament – law-making through debate, discussion, and consensus.
- Hence, the new Parliament offers **an opportunity to seriously introspect on Parliamentary conduct** and make Parliament **more efficient and productive.**

**Conclusion:** The new Parliament should not only be the fountainhead/epitome of architectural excellence but should also work as a lighthouse to guide India in its ambitious journey of ‘new India@100’; ‘Ek Bharat, Shrestha Bharat’, etc.

### [NavIC satellite: Why a regional navigation system matters to India](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/29/navic-satellite-why-a-regional-navigation-system-matters-to-india/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus: Science and Technology/ Geography**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/new-navic-satellite-launching-today-why-a-regional-navigation-system-matters-to-india-8633947/)

**Context**:  ISRO will launch a **new NavIC satellite ( NVS-01**), belonging to the second generation of the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS), known as NavIC, to overcome some of the previous issues faced by NavIC.

**Issues faced by NavIC (Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System):**

- **Atomic clock failure:** Several of the existing satellites stopped providing location data after their onboard atomic clocks failed
- **Satellite Replacement**: Some of the satellites in the NAVIC constellation have reached the **end of their mission life** or become partially defunct.
- **Limited Coverage:** While NAVIC provides coverage over the Indian landmass and a radius of 1,500 km around it, there is a need for further expansion and ground stations outside India to improve coverage and accuracy in hard-to-reach areas.
- **User Segment Development**: There has been a delay in the development of user receivers for the NAVIC system, resulting in limited utilization of the navigation services.
- **Mobile Compatibility**: Mobile phones in India currently lack compatibility to process NAVIC signals, limiting the widespread use of the system.
- **Security and Encryption**: Ensuring the security of NAVIC signals and preventing breaches or spoofing is a significant challenge.

**New features of the Satellite are (to overcome some of the issues):**

- **L1 Frequency:** The inclusion of the L1 frequency (besides L5 and S frequency) **enhances compatibility** with wearable devices and personal trackers. The inclusion of L1 frequency also increases interoperability with other satellite-based navigation systems.
- **Longer mission life**: The second-generation satellites will also have a longer mission life of **more than 12 years**. The existing satellites have a mission life of 10 years.
- **Rubidium atomic clock:** The atomic clock ensures accurate positioning, addressing a previous issue faced by satellites in the constellation
- **The heaviest in the constellation of NAVIC satellites** ( will be launched by a Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) rocket): Previous satellites were much lighter and launched on PSLV. The higher weight allowance allows for more instruments and fuel to be loaded.

**NavIC’s advantages over other systems:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Advantages**|**Explanation**|
|**Regional Coverage**|**India is the only country that has a regional satellite-based navigation** system (there are four global satellite-based navigation systems — the American GPS, the Russian GLONASS, the European Galileo, and the Chinese Beidou|
|**Higher Accuracy**|Once fully operational, NavIC open signals are expected to provide accuracy up to 5 meters, surpassing GPS accuracy (20 meters).|
|**Geo-stationary Satellites**|Unlike GPS, NavIC uses satellites in **high geo-stationery orbit**, ensuring constant coverage over the designated region.|
|**Improved Signal Reception**|NavIC signals arrive in India at a **90-degree angle**, making them easier to receive even in congested or obstructed areas (unlike GPS).|
|**Indigenous Development**|NavIC is developed by ISRO, showcasing India’s technological capabilities and reducing dependence on foreign systems.|

**Why a regional navigation system matters to India:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
||**Examples**|
|**Strategic Independence**|India’s NavIC system operates independently without relying on GPS or other global systems.|
|**National Security**|NavIC enables precise tracking and navigation for defence operations and military applications.|
|**Disaster Management**|NavIC helps in tracking and responding to natural disasters, such as cyclones and floods.|
|**Transportation and Navigation**|NavIC enables precise tracking of commercial vehicles, enhancing road safety and efficiency.|
|**Precision Agriculture and Farming**|NavIC aids farmers in optimizing crop management, irrigation, and soil nutrient application.|
|**Personal and Public Safety**|NavIC enables real-time tracking of fishermen and sends alerts in case of potential dangers at sea.|
|**Scientific and Technological Advancements**|NavIC aids in scientific experiments, geological surveys, and geodetic network development.|

**Conclusion:**

Currently, NavIC’s reach extends only 1,500 km beyond Indian territory. However, for applications involving ships and aeroplanes travelling beyond this range, satellites in Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) would be required. By adding MEO satellites in the future, NavIC can extend its **global reach and aim to provide navigation services** on a global scale, similar to the capabilities of the GPS system.

 **The limitations and potential drawbacks of using “giant artificial intelligence” (gAIs) like ChatGPT, Bard, Chinchilla, PaLM, LaMDA, et al**.**:**

- **Lack of democratic input:** gAIs are designed **from the top down**, limiting the involvement and input of the people who are meant to use them.
- **Reduction in diversity:** gAIs tend to **abstract away local knowledge** and diverse perspectives, favouring a more standardized and globalized view of information.
- **Language and cultural biases:** Models trained primarily on internet data, which is largely in English, can perpetuate biases and overlook the nuances of other languages and cultures.
- **Incomplete understanding**: gAIs may provide intelligible responses but can fail to fully grasp the context and intricacies of certain questions, leading to incomplete or inaccurate answers.
- **Stochastic behaviour**: gAIs can exhibit **randomness in their responses,** making their behaviour unpredictable and potentially unreliable.
- **Potential risks of artificial general intelligence (AGI):** Researchers warn that advancements in AGI, a field of study related to gAIs, could pose significant risks, including catastrophic consequences.
- **Reduction in human involvement:** The reliance on gAIs for knowledge work may lead to a decreased role for human expertise and decision-making, potentially eroding important skills and experiences.
- **Ethical concerns:** The deployment and use of gAIs raise ethical considerations, including privacy, transparency, and accountability in decision-making processes.

 **Context:** The Rajasthan government has announced its support for the **use of manufactured sand (M-Sand)** as a cost-effective and convenient alternative to river sand

- As per the **M-Sand Rajasthan policy introduced in 2021**, it is mandatory to use **at least 25% M-Sand** in government construction projects.
- M-Sand units have been **granted industrial status,** allowing them to benefit from the **Rajasthan Industrial Promotion Scheme (RIPS) 2019**, which includes subsidies and concessions on taxes and fees.

**What is M sand?**

M-Sand, or Manufactured Sand, is an alternative to natural river sand used in construction. It is produced by crushing rocks or quarry stones to obtain sand particles of consistent size and shape.

**Advantages:**

It has **similar properties to natural sand,** making it suitable for various construction purposes. It is cost-effective, readily available, and reduces the need for mining natural sand.

It also **requires less water** for **construction projects** as it does not need to be washed before use.

**Differences between M-Sand and natural sand:**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Aspect**|**M-Sand**|**Natural Sand**|
|**Particle Shape**|Cubic form, enhancing bonding|Flaky, sharp, and angular grains|
|**Silt Content**|Zero silt content|Silt content ranging from 3-20%|
|**Quality Control**|Manufactured in a controlled environment|No strict control, and variations in silt content|
|**Concrete Strength**|High concrete strength|Lower concrete strength|
|**Availability**|Requires production and availability may vary|Naturally occurring, availability depends on the riverbed|
|**Environmental Impact**|Reduces the need for natural sand mining, repurposes waste materials|This can lead to environmental degradation, habitat destruction, and water scarcity|
|**Cost-effectiveness**|Can be more cost-effective as it can be produced in large quantities at a lower cost|Cost may vary based on availability and location|

Sand is classified as a ‘**minor mineral’** under Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulations) Act, 1957, and administrative control vests with State Governments. **Sustainable Sand Mining Management Guidelines 2016,** issued by MoEFCC, encourages scientific sand mining and environmentally friendly management method.

 **Context:** The World Meteorological Congress – the supreme decision-making body of WMO, approved (in its 19th session) a new greenhouse gas (GHG) monitoring initiative – **Global Greenhouse Gas Watch.**

**Background:** In 2022, the WMO Executive Council decided to develop an architecture for a global **Greenhouse Gas Monitoring Infrastructure** to build on and expand WMO’s long-standing activities in GHG monitoring.

**The Global Greenhouse Gas Watch (G3W):** It aims to **establish internationally coordinated monitoring of GHG fluxes** (top-down) to support the provision of actionable information to the UNFCCC Parties and other stakeholders

**Need:**

- Currently, most GHG monitoring undertaken globally **relies heavily on research capabilities and research funding.**
- The **intermittent nature of research funding** and the competitive processes used for its allocation makes sustained global monitoring difficult to achieve.
