### [India-UAE CEPA](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/06/india-uae-cepa/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: Bilateral Relations**

**Source:** [**PIB**](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1921222)**,** [**GulfNews**](https://gulfnews.com/special-reports/what-is-india--uae-cepa-how-it-will-benefit-both-economies-1.1645252081334)

**Context:** The India-UAE Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) has had a significant impact on bilateral trade between the two countries **since its implementation in May 2022.**

- It is expected to **increase the total value of bilateral trade in goods** to over USD 100 billion and trade in services to over **USD 15 billion within five years**.

**India-UAE Trade relations:**

United Arab Emirates (UAE) is **India’s 3rd largest trading partner**, after the United States and China, with a bilateral trade turnover of **USD 68 billion** in 2021. The UAE is also the **7th largest investor in India**.

**What is a CEPA?**

A Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) is a **bilateral or multilateral trade agreement** between countries aimed at **promoting economic cooperation and integration** by reducing barriers to trade and investment.

**Difference between CEPA, CECA, and FTA:**

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|**Aspect**|**CEPA (Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement)**|**CECA (Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement)**|**FTA (Free Trade Agreement)**|
|**Definition**|A comprehensive trade agreement that covers **goods, services, and investments.**|It covers a wide range of areas, such as trade, investment, technology, and cultural exchanges.|A trade agreement that eliminates or reduces tariffs and other barriers to trade in goods between two or more countries.|
|**Level of integration**|**High level of integration** as it covers **not only trade in goods but also services, investments, and other** areas of cooperation.|**Medium level of integration** as it covers a wide range of areas but not as comprehensive as CEPA.|**Low level of integration** as it only covers trade in goods and **does not include services or investments.**|
|**Examples**|India-Singapore CEPA, Japan-Indonesia CEPA, etc.|India-Korea CECA, India-Malaysia CECA, etc.|India-UK FTA|

**Various dimensions of India-UAE CEPA:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Dimension**|**Example**|
|**Trade in Goods**|The CEPA provides **preferential market access for over 80% of products** traded between India and the UAE.<br><br>Bilateral trade between **India and the UAE** reached historic highs during FY 2022-23, increasing from USD **73 billion to USD 84 billion**, registering a **16% increase**|
|**Trade in Services**|The **CEPA covers 11 broad service sectors** and more than 100 sub-sectors, such as business services, communication services, financial services, tourism, and transport services.|
|**Investment**|The CEPA provides for a **liberal and non-discriminatory regime** for cross-border investment between India and the UAE.|
|**Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT)**|TBT aim to ensure that **technical regulations, standards, and conformity assessment procedures** do not create unnecessary obstacles to trade.|
|**Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Measures**|It aims to **protect human, animal, and plant health** by setting standards for food safety, animal and plant health, and other related issues.|
|**Dispute Settlement**|The CEPA includes **provisions on dispute settlement**, which provide for the resolution of disputes between India and the UAE through consultations and negotiations.|
|**Movement of Natural Persons**|The CEPA includes **provisions on the movement of natural persons**, which aim to facilitate **the temporary entry of businesspersons**, investors, and skilled professionals between India and the UAE.|
|**Pharmaceutical Products**|The CEPA includes provisions on **pharmaceutical products**, which aim to promote cooperation in the regulation and marketing of pharmaceuticals between India and the UAE.|
|**Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)**|The CEPA includes provisions on **IPR**, which aim to protect and enforce intellectual property rights between India and the UAE.|
|**Digital Trade**|The CEPA includes provisions on **digital trade**, which aim to promote the development of e-commerce and digital trade between India and the UAE.|

**Some of the challenges that the India-UAE CEPA may face are:**

- Competition from other existing trade agreements in the region
- Diverse business and cultural practices between the two countries
- The disparity in the level of development and economic size of the two countries
- Possible resistance from domestic industries in both countries
- Differences in regulatory standards and intellectual property protection.

**Conclusion**:

The trade between India and UAE has strengthened over the years, with the UAE becoming India’s closest geopolitical partner in the Arab world. Despite recent challenges, the bilateral ties between the two nations have proven resilient.

### [Poverty Estimation in India](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/06/poverty-estimation-in-india/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Issues Relating to Poverty and Hunger**

**Source:** [**LM**](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/we-shouldn-t-let-indian-poverty-turn-into-a-great-eternal-mystery-11683222042082.html)

**Context:** There has been no official estimate of poverty in India after 2011-12. However, many private estimates are available.

**Poverty estimation in India:**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/poverty.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/poverty.png)

- **Poverty** can be defined as a condition in which an individual or household lacks the financial resources to afford a basic minimum standard of living.
- **Reliable estimation** of poverty is the **first step towards eradication** of poverty as it provides input for the design, implementation and monitoring of anti-poverty programmes.
- **Two critical components of the estimation of poverty in India:**
    - **Information on the consumption expenditures**;
    - These expenditures are evaluated with reference to a given **poverty line.**
- In 2011, 21.9% **of Indians** were considered to be living below the national poverty line.
- **Globally, 8%** lived on less than the international poverty line (WB) of **US$1.90 per person per day.**

**Issues with estimates of poverty in India:**

- **Vary in a wide range:** From as high as 35% of India’s population in 2017-18 (by S. Subramanian) to a low of 1.4% (by Bhalla, Bhasin and Virmani) found for 2019-20.
- **No clear conclusion/consensus** on whether poverty rose after 2011-12 or fell.

**Why do these differences arise?**

- **Due to varying consumption expenditure data used.**
    - A modified version of data (by Bhalla) from the **Consumer Pyramid Household Survey** (CME) shows that poverty has declined in India.
    - While the **National Statistical Office** (NSO) data (by S. Subramanian) that poverty increased in India.
    - The only consumption expenditure survey **conducted by NSO in 2017-18 was abandoned**.
- **Due to different poverty lines used:**
    - **The consumption aggregates from the PLFS** estimate poverty at 17.9% in 2020-21, compared with 21.9% in 2011-12.
    - The latest (Panagariya and More) report a poverty ratio of **32% in 2019-20 and 26% in 2020-21** using the same PLFS consumption data.

**Good news for India:**

- A consumption expenditure survey is currently underway.
- This will update the national accounts and inflation indices.

**Challenges:**

- **The new methodology adopted:** The absence of a comparable survey means it won’t help answer what happened to poverty after 2011-12.
- **No public discussion** on the new methodology.

**Conclusion:** The discourse on poverty estimation has played an important role in highlighting the living conditions of the poor and the effectiveness of government policy. Thus, the adoption of a scientific methodology that will generate uniform-error-free data is the need of the hour.

### [The financial inclusion of women](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/06/the-financial-inclusion-of-women/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Welfare Schemes for Vulnerable Sections**

**Source:** [**LM**](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/the-financial-inclusion-of-women-is-set-for-a-tech-leap-11683047798440.html)

 **Context:** It is challenging to achieve financial inclusion (FI) for women until they actively participate in the formal financial industry.

**What is FI?**

The process of ensuring access to financial services and timely and adequate credit where needed by vulnerable groups such as weaker sections and low-income groups at an affordable cost. (RBI)

**Why do women need FI?**

- FI is considered **a critical indicator of development** and is identified as an **enabler for at least eight** **of the 17 SDGs**.
- **For women**, access to bank accounts, loans, insurance, and other financial services, results in direct improvements in outcomes of **health, education, employment → economic independence → empowerment**.
- In turn, such progress helps achieve the collective goals of **eradicating poverty, promoting inclusive growth, and reducing inequality.**

**The scheme promoting FI in India:**

**The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY):**

- **56%** of all these new accounts are owned by **women**, which implies remarkable FI that has significantly reduced the gender gap, **from 17% in 2011 to 6% in 2017**.

**Direct Benefits Transfer (DBT):**

- Since its inception in **2013**, the Indian government has cumulatively transferred **16.8 trillion to beneficiaries through DBT. This has led to the FI of women,** as they constitute a good number of beneficiaries under the schemes.

**Challenges:**

- Women still lack participation in the formal financial industry. **For example,**
    - Most women **only access their PMJDY accounts to withdraw** the benefit transfers from the various government initiatives.
    - Most of them do not use these accounts for **savings, to build a credit history or avail of any financial products** such as insurance and loans.
- **Inaccessibility:** Most financial services are beyond the reach of most women, particularly in the rural hinterland.
- **Concerns around privacy and confidentiality:** Hesitation to discuss personal financial matters with strangers.
- **The lack of collateral** due to limited access to assets and property impedes their ability to avail of loans.
- **They have less influence** over the family’s important financial choices → leading to wastages or use of benefits for non-essential purposes.

**How to address these concerns?**

- Promote women’s access to and literacy in digital tools.
- **Promote the use of digital payments among women.**
- Appoint **more women Business Correspondents (BCs).**
- Deepen **convergence with self-help groups**.
- **Collect gender-disaggregated data** and develop strategies to form **women-centric approaches.**
- **Promote digital credit for medium and small businesses.**

**Some best practices:**

- **The Bank Sakhis programme** by the National Rural Livelihoods Mission **trains SHG members** to work as BCs in rural districts.
- **The PM Mudra Yojana** targets the financial inclusion of women by providing collateral-free loans up to Rs. 1 million for small and micro enterprises.

**Way ahead: Digital payment solutions can be easily redesigned** to enable access to information that are key stumbling blocks to the FI of women.

### [Global Land Outlook report](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/06/global-land-outlook-report/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus:** **Environment, conservation**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/explained-land-restoration-un-global-land-outlook-report/article66813569.ece)

**Context:** According to the 2nd edition of the Global Land Outlook (GLO) report, humans have **breached four out of nine planetary boundaries**.

**GLO:**

- It is a United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification’s ([**UNCCD**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/05/12/unccd-conference-of-parties-cop-15/)) flagship publication, whose 1st edition was launched in **2017** at the UNCCD COP13 (China).
- It underscores **land system challenges**, showcases transformative policies and practices, and points to **cost-effective pathways** to scale up sustainable land and water management.

**Highlights of the report:**

 **Importance of Land:** It is the **operative link** between biodiversity loss and climate change, which means restoring land is crucial to solving interconnected crises.

**What are planetary boundaries?**

- The **environmental thresholds** that establish a **“safe operating space for humanity**” are known as planetary boundaries.
- **The nine planetary boundaries are:**
    - Biodiversity loss
    - Land-use change
    - Climate change
    - Nitrogen and phosphorus (geochemical) cycles
    - Freshwater use
    - Ocean acidification
    - Chemical pollution
    - Atmospheric loading
    - Ozone depletion

**Threats:**

- Humans have already **altered more than 70%** of the earth’s land area from its natural state.
- Of the 9 planetary boundaries, climate change, biodiversity loss, land-use change, and geochemical cycles **have already been exceeded**.

**Causes:**

- Worldwide, **food systems** (including agriculture) are responsible for **80% of deforestation and 70% of freshwater use** and are the single greatest cause of terrestrial biodiversity loss.
- **Land degradation,** [**desertification**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/environment-degradation-and-issues/desertification/#:~:text=Desertification%20is%20the%20process%20by,and%20dry%20sub%2Dhumid%20areas.) **and drought** pose a great risk to global food security as well.
    - Land degradation is the **reduction or loss of biological and economic productivity of land** and its constituents: soil, water, and biodiversity.

**Impact:** This has contributed significantly to **global warming and environmental degradation** → leading to a rise in **poverty, hunger, inequality, zoonotic disease transmission,** etc.

**Recommendations:**  

**Effective land restoration:**

- **The report defines land restoration** as a continuum of activities that
    - **Avoid** (By eliminating practices that degrade the environment, ranging from land and ecosystem conversion to socio-economic inequalities)
    - **Reduce** (By adopting sustainable land and water management practices) and
    - **Reverse** (By revitalising soil, watersheds, and other elements of natural ecosystems) **land degradation** with the explicit objective of **meeting human needs and improving ecology.**
- **The global annual cost of land restoration** is expected at ~$300 billion by 2030.
- Each dollar invested is estimated to **return between $7 and $30** in economic benefits, moving towards an **equitable and sustainable future.**

**Achieving land degradation neutrality (LDN):** LDN is a state whereby the quantity and quality of land resources required to maintain ecosystem functions and services and improve food security are steady or growing.

**Integrated land use planning:**

- **Identifying the best combination of land uses** → sustainably meeting the **needs of the stakeholders as well as preserving the land resources.**
- A cost-effective approach is to **identify landscapes** while maximising benefits, such as in **global restoration hotspots.**

**Regenerative agricultural practices:** Like terrace farming and rainwater harvesting → help restore land, increase crop yields, reduce GHG emissions, sequester atmospheric carbon, and create meaningful livelihoods.

**Inclusive and responsible governance:** It is crucial to facilitate the shift to sustainable land use and management practices.

|---|---|
|**Initiatives of Land Restoration**|   |
|**Global**|**India**|
|**The Bonn Challenge** (2011) is a global effort to restore 350 million hectares of the world’s degraded and deforested lands by 2030.|Currently, **97.85 million hectares** (mha) of land – an area 2.5 times the size of India’s largest state Rajasthan, has already been degraded.|
|**UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration:** The Decade (2021-2030) is being championed by the UNEP and FAO.|In 2019, India raised its land restoration target (under the Bonn Challenge) from **21 million hectares to 26 million hectares by 2030.**|
|**The G20 Global Initiative on Reducing Land Degradation and Enhancing Conservation of Terrestrial Habitats:** Launched in 2020, it aims to prevent, halt and reverse land degradation and reduce degraded land by 50% by 2040.|Now, **MGNREGS is** to fund work to reverse land degradation.|

**Some best practices in India:**

- **Holiyas:** These are water management systems in Gujarat, which store rainwater below the land surface. The groundwater can be accessed and distributed using solar pumps when there is scarcity.
- **Plantopathy:** It is a unique nature-based solution that can limit the impact of plant diseases on yields without pesticides or chemicals.
- **Zero budget natural farming (ZBNF):** It combines traditional and emerging practices to reduce costs (i.e., zero budget) while boosting yields and overall farm health by using organic inputs sourced locally (i.e., natural farming).

**Conclusion:** Land restoration is a **shared responsibility.** Hence, governments, scientists, civil society, and private sector players need to work together to set land and ecosystem restoration goals that transform land-use systems.

**Context:** To further tighten its control of practising accountants, the Centre has brought within the ambit of the **PMLA** their “financial transactions”.

**What are the new rules?**

- Chartered accountants, company secretaries, etc., will now be required to **go through the Know Your Company (KYC) process before commencing work.**
- This implies accountants are now **reporting entities** if they are managing their clients’ money.

**Significance:** The move aims at curbing fraudulent practices by which accountants allegedly help their clients to launder money.

**Need:** The efforts are being taken ahead of the assessment of India under the **Financial Action Task Force (FATF)** – a global regulator that assesses country compliance in tackling global money laundering and terror financing.

**What does the PMLA say about reporting entities?**

They are required to maintain a record of all transactions and furnish them to **financial intelligence units** (FIUs).
