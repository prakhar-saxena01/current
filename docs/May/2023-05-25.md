### [Indian Diaspora: Sri Lanka’s Malaiyaha Tamils](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/25/indian-diaspora-sri-lankas-malaiyaha-tamils/)

#### **GS2/GS Paper 1**

 **Syllabus****: Indian Diaspora/ Indian History** 

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/remember-our-history-recognise-our-labour-say-sri-lankas-malaiyaha-tamils/article66888649.ece)

 **Context:** The Malaiyaha Tamil community in Sri Lanka has released a declaration calling for **greater recognition, political rights, and improved living and working conditions**.

**Who are Malaiyaha Tamil community?**

The Malaiyaha Tamil community refers to a **historically marginalized group** in Sri Lanka who migrated from southern India **around 200 years ago** to work in British-run plantations. They mainly work in **tea and rubber estates**, contributing significantly to Sri Lanka’s foreign exchange earnings. Their population is roughly **around 10 lakhs** (out of which around **1.5 lakh people** work in tea and rubber estates)

**Problems faced by the Malaiyaha Tamil community in Sri Lanka:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Problems**|**Specific Examples**|
|**Structural Exclusion**|Limited access to **resources and opportunities** compared to other communities. **Poor human development indices** compared to other communities.|
|**Discrimination and Exploitation**|Deprived of **citizenship rights until 2003**. Subjected to **discrimination and exploitation** in various aspects of life.|
|**Inadequate Living Conditions**|Many families still reside in **colonial-era line rooms** without basic amenities.  A UN body  highlighted in 2021 that the community is living in **“inhumane and degrading” conditions**|
|**Economic Distress**|The financial crisis in Sri Lanka further exacerbated their economic hardships. **More than half the populatio**n living in estate areas is pushed into **acute poverty.**|
|**Low wages**|Their daily wage of **LKR 1,000 (about ₹373**) is tied to the target of **18-22 kg of plucked tea leaves every day**, while braving leeches and wasp attacks.|
|**Limited Political Representation**|**Lack of recognition** as a distinct identity and equal citizens. Demand for **appropriate political power** sharing and proportional electoral arrangements.|

**To alleviate these problems, the Malaiyaha Tamil community has released a declaration demanding the following:**

- **Design, resource, and implement a 10-year development plan** based on affirmative action to address decades of structural exclusion.
- **Reduce poverty, provide land and housing**, and enhance public health and education access.
- **Ensure labour rights**, including fair living wages and legal protection.
- Recognize the Malaiyaha Tamils as a community with a **distinct identity** and **equal citizenship.**
- Establish appropriate **political power sharing** and a proportional system of electoral arrangements.

**Assistance provided by India:**

- Grant projects cut across sectors such as **education, health, livelihood, housing, and industrial**
- The **Indian Housing Project** aims to build **50,000 houses in war-affected** areas and estate workers in the plantation areas. However, the progress on it has been slow.
- India now offers **about 710 scholarship slots** annually to Sri Lankan students.
- The reconstruction work of a **century-old railway track** in **northern Sri Lanka**under India’s assistance

**Conclusion:**

India and the International community must pressure Sri Lanka into providing the community with **greater recognition, political rights, and improved living and working conditions** through affirmative action and long-term development plans.

### [76th World Health Assembly](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/25/76th-world-health-assembly/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Important International Institutions, agencies and fora – their Structure, Mandate**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/health/health-for-all-who-launches-first-ever-roadmap-to-link-health-with-sustainable-economic-growth-89525)

 **Context:** The 76th [World Health Assembly](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/05/23/world-health-assembly-wha/) (WHA) is being held in Geneva (Switzerland) with the theme: **WHO at 75: Saving lives, driving health for all**.

**WHO and WHA:**

- **WHO:** Since 1948, the World Health Organization (WHO) – the UN specialized health agency, leads and championed global efforts to give everyone, everywhere a safe and healthy life.
- **WHA:** It is the **main decision-making body** of WHO and comprises **194 Member States**. Every year, delegates from all Member States come together (generally in May) to agree on the Organisation’s priorities and policies.

**Highlights of the 76th WHA:**

1. **Health for All: Transforming economies to deliver what matters report:**

- It was launched by the WHO Council on the Economics of Health for All – formed in 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
- The report provides **a roadmap to focus on the links between health and sustainable, inclusive and innovation-led economic growth.**

**It recommended reorienting economies to deliver health for all across four interrelated themes:** 

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/valuing.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/valuing.png)

**Significance:** Instead of health for all being seen as the servant of economic growth → **roadmap will structure economic activity** in a way that will allow all people faster with better access to essential health services.

2. **Pandemic treaty:**

- Negotiations on **new rules for dealing with pandemics** are underway at the WHA.
- The WHO already has binding rules known as the **International Health Regulations** – adopted in **2005 after the SARS outbreak.**
- These regulations are still considered appropriate for **regional epidemics**, such as Ebola but inadequate for a global pandemic.

**What is the so-called Pandemic treaty?**

- It should be a **legally binding** treaty (proposed by the EU and to be adopted by May 2024) for those who sign up.
- It would be **only the second such health accord** after the **2003 Framework Convention on Tobacco Control** – a treaty that aims to reduce smoking via taxation and rules on labelling and advertising.
- **Developing countries**, especially in Africa, are keen to use the negotiations to secure better access to vaccines.
- However, the proposed treaty has come under fire as **critics warn that it could lead to countries ceding authority to the WHO**.

### [National Human Rights Commission](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/25/national-human-rights-commission/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Statutory, Regulatory and various Quasi-judicial Bodies**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/un-recognised-global-alliance-of-national-human-rights-institutions-keeps-nhrc-waiting-over-political-meddling/article66889992.ece#:~:text=For%20the%20second%20time%20in,in%20probes%20into%20human%20rights)

 **Context:** For the 2nd time in a decade, the UN-backed **Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)** deferred the accreditation of the [National Human Rights Commission](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/statutory-regulatory-and-various-quasi-judicial-bodies/national-human-rights-commission/#:~:text=It%20is%20responsible%20for%20the,embodied%20in%20the%20International%20Covenants%E2%80%9D.), India (NHRC-India).

**GANHRI:**

- Formerly known as the International Coordinating Committee of National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs), **GAHNRI is a global network of NHRIs**.
- It is constituted as a **non-profit entity** (under Swiss law) and Secretariat support is provided by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (**OHCHR**).
- **It coordinates the relationship between NHRIs and the UN** human rights system.

[**The Paris Principles**](https://ganhri.org/paris-principles/#:~:text=The%20key%20pillars%20of%20the,and%20protect%20all%20human%20rights)**:**

- They were defined in 1991 and were adopted by the UN Human Rights Commission (1992) and the UN General Assembly (**1993**).
- They provide the **international benchmarks against which NHRI can be accredited**.
- They set out **6 main criteria** that NHRIs are required to meet. These are:
    - mandate and competence;
    - autonomy from the government;
    - independence guaranteed by a statute or Constitution;
    - pluralism;
    - adequate resources; and
    - adequate powers of investigation.

**Importance of GANHRI accreditation:**

- Institutions accredited with “**A status**” means full compliance with the **Paris Principles**.
- It is the **only non-UN body** whose internal accreditation system grants access to UN committees – speaking rights and seating at [human rights](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/10/14/importance-of-human-rights/) treaty bodies.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**NHRC-India**|   |
|**About**|It is a **statutory** body established on 12 October 1993 (in conformity with the **Paris Principles**), under the **Protection of Human Rights Act (PHRA) 1993** [[Amended in 2019](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/statutory-regulatory-and-various-quasi-judicial-bodies/national-human-rights-commission/)].|
|**Objective**|**A watchdog** for the promotion and protection of the human rights of citizens of India. **The PHRA defines Human Rights** as the rights relating to life, liberty, equality and dignity of the individual guaranteed by the Constitution or embodied in the International Covenants and enforceable by courts in India.|
|**Composition (13)**|**A Chairperson**, who has been a Chief Justice of India or a Judge of the SC.<br><br>**1 member,** who is, or has been, a Judge of the SC.<br><br>**2 member**, who is, or has been, the Chief Justice of an HC.<br><br>**3 Members**, out of which at least one shall be a **woman** to be appointed from amongst persons having knowledge or practical experience in matters relating to human rights.<br><br>**7 ex officio members** – NCSC, NCST, NCBC, NCW, National Commission for Minorities, National Commission for Protection of Child Rights and the Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities.|
|**Appointment**|By the **President of India**, on the recommendation of a committee consisting of –  The PM (Chairperson), The Union Home Minister, The LoP in the Lok Sabha, The LoP in the Rajya Sabha, The Speaker of the Lok Sabha, The Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha.<br><br>The sitting Judge of the SC or sitting Chief Justice of any HC can be appointed only after **consultation with the CJI**.|

**Why is the accreditation NHRC-India deferred?**

- Lack of independence (political interference in appointments).
- Lack of diversity (in staff and leadership) and accountability.
- Insufficient action to protect marginalised communities, religious minorities, and human rights defenders.
- Involving the police in probes into human rights violations.
- Poor cooperation with civil society.
- All of the above is contrary to the ‘**Paris Principles**’.

**Way ahead:**

- Its decisions **should be made enforceable** by the government.
- Members of NHRCs should include **civil society, human rights activists**, etc.
- NHRC should have its **independent investigating staff.**

### [GST has begun to show sustained growth](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/25/gst-has-begun-to-show-sustained-growth/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus****: Economy: Taxation**

**Source:** [**BS**](https://www.business-standard.com/opinion/columns/the-unsung-hero-123052301196_1.html)

**Context**: The article highlights the **trend in tax collection in India post-Covid**, specifically focusing on direct taxes and GST.

**Direct Tax Vs GST**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Direct Tax**|**GST**|
|Direct tax refers to the taxes imposed on **individuals and entities** (levied directly on the taxpayer) based on their income, profits, or assets. It includes taxes like income tax, corporate tax, and wealth tax.|GST (Goods and Services Tax) is an **indirect tax levied on the supply of goods and services**. GST is a **consumption-based tax** that is charged at each stage of the supply chain, from production to the final sale.|
|During COVID, direct tax experienced a decline of nearly 10% but then saw a growth rate of **49% in 2021-22 and 18%** in 2022-23.|The **recovery in GST collection has been better compared to direct taxes.**|
|While the **growth of corporation tax** has been high, personal income-tax collection has declined.|**Better recovery in GST has been due to:**<br><br>a) e-invoicing and procedural simplification, b) better compliance procedures, c) the rising inflation rate and d) the rise in import duties|

[**About GST:**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/07/02/editorial-analysis-gst-five-years-stronger/)

GST (introduced **on July 1, 2017) is a** multi-stage collection mechanism and aims to be a **unified indirect tax** across the country on products and services. The objectives of GST include **simplifying the tax system, preventing misclassifications and litigations**, avoiding an **inverted duty structure**, and ensuring a destination-based consumption taxation approach.

**Implementation:**

GST is implemented through a **dual GST model**, with the **Centre and States levying taxes** on a common base. The rates for GST range from **5%, 12%, 16% and 28%,** and it applies to most goods and services**, excluding alcoholic liquor for human consumption and five petroleum products (**petroleum crude, motor spirit (petrol), high-speed diesel, natural gas and aviation turbine fuel**).** The **GST Council**, headed by the Union Finance Minister, is the governing body responsible for making key decisions regarding GST.

**Achievements of GST:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Achievement**|**Explanation**|
|**High GST revenues**|GST revenues have shown a **high growth rate** ( constantly reaching over 1.5 Lakh crore a month collection)|
|**Technological achievements**|The **GSTN, the technology platform for GST**, has been successfully stabilized, ensuring smooth operations and transactions.|
|**E-invoicing implementation**|Mandating **e-invoicing for businesses above Rs 100 crore** has improved invoice matching and detection of **fake invoices,** enhancing tax compliance.|
|**Improved tax compliance and enforcement**|E-invoicing, e-waybill and online processes have **improved tax compliance and enabled better enforcement,** reducing instances of fraud and disputes.|
|**Reduction in transaction costs**|GST has **significantly reduced transaction costs**, making business operations more efficient and cost-effective.|
|**Removal of hidden and embedded taxes**|By removing hidden and embedded taxes, GST has improved the **competitiveness of domestic industries** in the global market.|
|**Seamless tax credits**|The system of **seamless tax credits** throughout the value chain and across state boundaries has **minimized the cascading effect of taxes.**|

**Challenges/Limitations of GST:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Challenge**|**Explanation**|
|**Refund delay issues**|There are concerns regarding **delays in export refunds**, impacting businesses reliant on timely refunds under the GST regime.|
|**Rate differentiation**|The presence of **multiple tax rates is seen as inefficient** for targeting benefits to the poor, leading to complexities and potential disparities in the tax system.|
|**Lack of dispute redressal mechanism**|The **absence of a statutory mechanism for uniform rulings by authorities** has resulted in a lack of clarity and consistency in resolving disputes under the GST regime.|
|**Constant amendments**|The **frequent amendments made to the GST law** have caused confusion among taxpayers and tax administrators, leading to misunderstandings and misconceptions.|
|**Adaption and technical issues**|**Small and medium businesses face challenges** in adapting to the tech-enabled GST regime, with IT glitches affecting the seamless flow of input credits and ease of compliance.|
|**Complex penalties**|Businesses often face **difficulties in monitoring vendor behaviour and believe they should not be penalized** for compliance deficiencies of their vendors after paying GST amounts.|
|[**15th Finance Commission**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/02/25/insights-into-editorial-navigating-the-storm-on-the-fifteenth-finance-commission/) **concerns**|The 15th Finance Commission has highlighted additional concerns, including the **multiplicity of tax rates**, shortfalls in GST collections, volatility in collections, and inconsistencies in return filing. The dependency of states on compensation from the centre is also a concern.|

**Conclusion:** 

**Anti-profiteering measures and compliance procedures** in GST need to be streamlined to ensure cost efficiency and price reduction benefits reach the common man. A group of ministers has proposed the **removal of exemptions on various services**, aiming to bring uniformity and broaden the tax base under GST.

 **Context:** According to the **ITF Transport Outlook 2023**, acting now and [decarbonising transportation](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/06/26/decarbonizing-transport-project/) can help in achieving the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement.

**The ITF Transport Outlook 2023:** It was released by the International Transport Forum (ITF) at the **Leipzig Transport Summit**.

**ITF:** It is a **think tank** (administratively integrated with the OECD yet politically autonomous) for transport policy that organises the Annual Summit of transport ministers.

**Leipzig (Germany) Transport Summit:**

- Transport ministers from across 64 member countries of the ITF gathered under the event theme of **‘Transport Enabling Sustainable Economies’.**
- **The United Kingdom** holds the current Presidency of the annual Summit.

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/economies.png)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/economies.png)

**Highlights of the ITF Transport Outlook 2023**

- If action to decarbonise transport is accelerated, the transport sector can still **reduce its CO2 emissions by about 80% over the next 25 years** (compared to 2019).
- This drop will enable **limiting the global temperature increase** to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels – the Paris Agreement goal.

**Reaching this high-ambition scenario requires:**

- A combination of **complementary policies** that avoid unnecessary transport activity.
- **Shift to no-carbon transport** and improve the efficiency of transport.
- Scale up **cost-competitive technologies** and fuels to move people and goods with fewer emissions.

**Advantage of reaching this high-ambition scenario:** The total capital investment needs of core infrastructure (road, rail, airports and ports) will be 5% lower with ambitious policies in place than carrying on with business as usual.

**Policy recommendations:**

 **Context:** During the inauguration of the **new Parliament building**, **a sacred “sengol” sceptre**  (a Symbol of Transfer of Power) that was given to **Jawaharlal Nehru** on the eve of Independence will be handed over to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

**About the Issue:**

Renowned danseuse **Padma Subrahmanyam’s letter** to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) triggered a detailed investigation into the historic Sengol, a sceptre from Tamil Nadu. It was discovered that the **Sengol ceremony took place just minutes** before Nehru’s iconic midnight speech on August 15, 1947. The sceptre had been kept at his **Prayagraj residence-turned-museum until now.**

**About “sengol” sceptre:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
||**Description**|
|**What is “sengol” sceptre?**|The “sengol” sceptre is **a long, stick-like item** ( 5 feet) made of **silver and covered in gold**. The sceptre has a **carving of a bull, called a Nandi, at the top**. This is done to remind everyone about the importance of fair and just leadership in the country.|
|**Significance**|It represents the **idea that the person who holds** it should **rule with fairness and justice**. It is believed to have a **connection to the Chola dynasty**, an ancient kingdom in Tamil Nadu.|
|**Name**|‘Sengol’ is derived from the Tamil word **‘semmai,**’ which means excellence, the ‘Sengol’ represents the embodiment of **power and authority.**|
|**Suggested by C Rajagopalachari**|The idea of using the ‘Sengol’ sceptre for the symbolic transfer of power **came from C Rajagopalachari**, the last Governor-General of India. When Lord Mountbatten, the Viceroy of British India, asked for a suitable symbol, Rajaji suggested the ‘Sengol’ sceptre. He was inspired by a **similar ceremony in the ancient Chola dynasty**, where power was **passed from one king to another**.|
|**‘Aanai’ Order**|In the Chola tradition, during the transfer of power ceremony, in addition to the presentation of the sceptre, an order called **‘aanai’ in Tamil** was bestowed upon the new ruler. This order symbolizes the responsibility to **govern with unwavering adherence to the principles of ‘dharma,’** ensuring justice and fairness in the realm.|
|**Crafted by Vummidi Bangaru Chetty**|To bring the ‘Sengol’ sceptre to life, **Chennai-based jeweller Vummidi Bangaru Chetty** undertook the task of crafting this historic symbol.|
