### [Antiquities abroad: What Indian, international laws say](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/15/antiquities-abroad-what-indian-international-laws-say/)

#### **GS Paper 1**

**Syllabus:** **Indian culture – salient aspects of Art Forms, Literature and Architecture from ancient to modern times**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/antiquities-abroad-indian-international-laws-metropolitan-museum-of-art-subhash-kapoor-8495034/#:~:text=No%20person%20shall%2C%20himself%20or,Survey%20of%20India%20(ASI).)

**Context:** According to an RTI, only 486 antiquities have been reported as missing (since Independence) from the 3,696 monuments protected and maintained by the ASI.

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/l-r.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/l-r.png)**

**What is antiquity?**

- India’s [**Antiquities and Art Treasures Act (AATA), 1972**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/12/27/antiquities-and-art-treasuries-act-must-be-revised-so-as-to-make-trading-in-indian-art-more-institutionalized-do-you-agree-comment/), defines “antiquity” as any coin, sculpture, painting, epigraph or other work of art or craftsmanship that has been in existence **for not less than 100 years**.
    - **For a manuscript, record or other documents** which are of scientific, historical, literary or aesthetic value, this duration is **not less than 75 years.**
- **The** [**UNESCO**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/international-relations/important-international-institutions-agencies-and-further-structure-mandate-etc/un/unesco/) **1970 Convention** defines “**cultural property**” as the one designated by countries having importance for archaeology, prehistory, history, literature, art or science.

**How have Indian laws relating to the country’s heritage evolved?**

- **Before Independence**, the **Antiquities (Export Control) Act 1947** ensured that no antiquity could be exported without a license.
- **After Independence,**
    - All the **Union, State and Concurrent Lists** of the **Schedule VII** of the Indian Constitution deal with the country’s heritage.
    - In **1958**, [**The Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/02/21/sansad-tv-75-years-laws-that-shaped-india-the-ancient-monuments-archaeological-sites-remains-act-1958/#:~:text=The%20Ancient%20Monuments%20and%20Archaeological%20Sites%20and%20Remains%20Act%20(or,of%20archaeological%20excavations%20and%20for) was enacted.
    - A few incidents of theft of antiquities along with the **UNESCO convention (1970**), prompted the government to enact the **AATA 1972.**

**Salient provisions of the AATA 1972:**

- Other than the Central Government, **no person can export any antiquity or art treasure.**
- No person can carry on the business of selling any antiquity **except in accordance with the terms and conditions of a licence** – granted by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).
- After the AATA was implemented (1976), the Centre asked traders in antiquities and art objects **to declare their possessions of antiquities.**
- Every person who owns, controls or is in possession of any antiquity **shall register such antiquity** and obtain a certificate.
    - **What is the ‘provenance’ of antiquity?** It includes the list of all owners from the time the object left its maker’s possession to the time it was acquired by the current owner.

**Registered antiquities in India:** So far, the National Mission on Monuments and Antiquities (2007), **has registered 3.52 lakh antiquities among the 16.70 lakh it has documented.**

**Threats to antiquities:**

- **The illicit import, export and transfer of ownership** of cultural property are one of the main causes of the impoverishment of the cultural heritage of the countries of origin (UNESCO).
- Almost 50 years after the UNESCO convention, the illicit international traffic of cultural items **is sadly increasingly prolific** [INTERPOL report (2019)].

**Can India bring back antiquities?**

- **There are three categories** – antiquities taken out of India pre-independence; taken out since independence and until the implementation of AATA and antiquities taken out since 1976.
- **For items in the first category,** requests have to be raised bilaterally or on international fora.
- Antiquities in the **second and third categories** can be retrieved by raising an issue bilaterally with proof of ownership and with the help of the UNESCO convention.

**Why are laws incapable of stopping illicit activity?**

- The registered antiquities in India **are a very small portion of the total number** (estimated to be around 58 lakh).
- In India, the problem with missing antiquities is that in many cases, **there is no FIR**, which is the first thing in order to prove ownership.
- The biggest challenge India is facing in bringing back antiquities is the **gap between the artefacts officially declared missing** and surfacing in global markets/museums.

**Way ahead:**

- **Robust database** of existing and stolen antiques and artefacts.
- **ASI must be provided with additional resources** for the protection and maintenance of antiquities.
- **International co-operation** constitutes one of the most efficient means of protecting each country’s cultural property.

### [Guidelines on medical negligence under consideration says Union Health Ministry](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/15/guidelines-on-medical-negligence-under-consideration-says-union-health-ministry/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus: Social Justice – Health**

**Source:** [**The Hindu**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/guidelines-on-medical-negligence-under-consideration-says-union-health-ministry/article66617921.ece)

**Context:** The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has taken into consideration the **healthcare sector’s long-standing demand to frame guidelines for determining medical negligence cases.**

**Background:**

- It has **been more than 17 years** since the Supreme Court, for **the first time in the Jacob Mathew case in 2005**, directed the Centre to frame statutory rules in consultation with the-then medical education regulator **Medical Council of India (MCI) to deal with medical negligence cases as it impacts both doctors and patients**.

**About Medical Negligence:**

- Medical negligence, also known as **medical malpractice**, refers to a situation where a **healthcare professional fails to provide the appropriate standard of care to a patient, resulting in harm, injury, or death.**

**Supreme Court criteria on Medical Negligence:**

- In **Kusum Sharma v. Batra Hospital & Medical Research Centre**, a two-judge Supreme Court panel recognized several criteria to regulate medical negligence cases.

**Bolam Test**

- The Bolam test was created in 1957 as a result of the judgement of the House of Lords in Bolam v Frierm Barnet Hospital Management Committee, which said that a **doctor may be able to escape a lawsuit for negligence if he can show that other medical practitioners would have behaved in the same manner.**
- The Bolam test, which argues that a doctor is not negligent if **what he has done would be approved by a responsible body of medical opinion in the relevant speciality at the time, remains the principal test to assess ‘standard of care’.**

**Various incidents of medical negligence:**

1. **Foreign matter left inside after surgery**
2. **Wrong part Removed**
3. **Doctor acting in a callous manner**
4. **Death due to transfusion of blood from a wrong group**

**Implications of medical negligence:**

- **Physical harm**
- **Emotional harm**
- **Financial harm**
- **Loss of trust**
- **Impact on the healthcare system**

### [Powering the Amrit Kaal through an integrated approach to ensure energy security](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/15/powering-the-amrit-kaal-through-an-integrated-approach-to-ensure-energy-security/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus:** **Infrastructure (Energy)**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/hardeep-s-puri-writes-powering-amrit-kaal-ndia-energy-week-2023-8492800/)

**Context:** An integrated approach that focuses on renewable energy along with the exploration of traditional fuels is the key to **energy security** in the next 25 years in India.

**Need for an integrated approach:**

- **3As:** Ensuring energy **access, availability and affordability** for India’s large population.
- As the world’s fastest-growing major economy with rising energy needs, India will a**ccount for approximately 25% of the global energy demand** **growth between 2020-2040**.

**The success story of India:**

- When petrol and diesel prices went up by 35-40% in the US, Canada, Spain and the UK, **prices of diesel in India have actually gone down** in the last 1 year.
    - This is despite the fact that **India imports over 85% of its crude oil** and 55% of its natural gas requirements.
- When several countries in India’s neighbourhood have had dry outs and power cuts to manage demand, **there has been no shortage of fuel anywhere in India.**

**How was this made possible?**

Through a pragmatic and balanced energy strategy → ensuring **energy justice.**

**Focus on traditional fuels:**

- The Centre and many states **announced massive cuts in excise duty and VAT rates**.
- **Oil PSUs absorbed huge losses** to ensure that the massive hikes in the prices of crude oil and natural gas were not passed on to Indian consumers.
- **Subsidised APM gas** for the city gas distribution sector was drastically increased.
- **Imposing an export cess** on petrol, diesel and ATF.
- **A windfall tax on domestically produced petroleum products** to prevent refiners and producers from profiteering at the cost of domestic consumers.
- Over the years, India has expanded –
    - **Its network of crude oil suppliers** from 27 nations to 39 nations. **For example,** in the US, the energy trade has gone up 13 times in the last four years.
    - **Its refining capacity** (450 MMT by 2040) – India is a global exporter of petroleum products [refining capacity is the 4th-largest after the US, China and Russia].
    - Traditional fuel exploration – reduced the prohibited/no-go areas in its EEZ by 99%, releasing nearly 1 million sq km for exploration.
    - **These strategic market cards** not only ensured **affordable** energy for Indian consumers but also had a calming effect on global petroleum markets.
- India is also pushing to move towards a **gas-based economy** by increasing the share of gas from the current **3 to 15% by 2030**.

**Focus on alternative fuels/energy transition:**

- India announced its [**net-zero emissions by 2070**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/11/02/india-will-achieve-net-zero-emissions-by-2070/) **and cutting down emissions by 1 billion tonnes by 2030 targets**.
- At the **India Energy Week 2023**, India took a giant stride in **its** [**biofuel revolution**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/20/sansad-tv-national-policy-on-biofuels/) **by launching E20** – 20% ethanol-blended gasoline, which will be rolled out in 15 cities in the next 2 years.
    - India’s ethanol-blending gasoline has grown from just **53% in 2013-14 to 10.17% in 2023.**
- India is also setting up **five 2nd-generation ethanol plants** that can convert agricultural waste into biofuel, further reducing pollution due to stubble burning, and generating income for farmers.
- [**The National Green Hydrogen Mission**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/05/centre-clears-%E2%82%B919744-crore-green-hydrogen-mission/#:~:text=Development%20of%20Green%20Hydrogen%20Production,6%20lakh%20jobs%20by%202030) has been launched with an outlay of Rs 19,744 crore to accelerate India’s efforts **towards 4 MT of annual green hydrogen production**.
    - It will save Rs 1 lakh crore in cumulative fossil fuel import savings by 2030.
- India is also supporting **electric vehicles through a production-linked incentive scheme** to make advanced fuel cells of 50-gigawatt hours.
- India is also targeting the installation of **alternative fuel stations (EV charging/ CNG/ LPG/ LNG/ CBG)** at 22,000 retail outlets by **May 2024**.

**Conclusion:**

**Energy security and independence** remain the main objectives as India implements its Amrit Kaal plan to grow to a **$ 26 trillion economy by 2047**.

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus:** **Linkages between Development and Spread of Extremism**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/what-is-the-soo-agreement-manipur-govt-withdrew-from-8494829/)

**Context:** The state government of Manipur decided to withdraw from the **Suspension of Operations** (SoO) agreement with two hill-based tribal militant groups.

**Background:** Two hill-based tribal militant groups – **Kuki National Army (KNA) and Zomi Revolutionary Army (ZRA)** were allegedly influencing agitation among forest encroachers.

**The Kuki people:**

- They are an **ethnic group native to the Mizo Hills** (formerly Lushai) – a mountainous region in the southeastern part of Mizoram and Manipur in India.
- In Northeast India, they are present in **all states except Arunachal Pradesh** and some 50 tribes of Kuki peoples are recognised as STs.
- The **Chin** people of Myanmar and the **Mizo** people of Mizoram are related to the Kukis and are collectively termed the **Zo**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/kuki_homeland_1.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/kuki_homeland_1.png)

**What are the roots of the Kuki insurgency?**

- The Kuki insurgency gained momentum **after ethnic clashes with the Nagas of Manipur** in the early 1990s.
- While the two tribes have shared **a hostile relationship since colonial times**, clashes took place in the 1990s when claims of “kuki homeland” in the Manipur hills **overlapped** with the imagined Naga homeland of Greater Nagaland/Nagalim.
- While the Naga movement is the country’s longest-running insurgency, **underground Kuki groups too have fought the Indian government for an ‘independent Kuki homeland’ since then**.

**What is the SoO pact?**

- There are nearly 30 Kuki insurgent groups in Manipur, of which 25 are under **tripartite** Suspension of Operations (SoO) with the Government of India and the state.
- The SoO pact was signed on **August 22, 2008**, with the primary objective of **initiating political dialogue**.

**What are the terms of the SoO pact?**

- The important terms under the pact are that security forces, including state and central forces, are **not to launch any operations**, nor can the underground groups.
- The signatories (like UPF, and KNO) shall **abide by the Constitution of India**, the laws of the land and the **territorial integrity of Manipur**.
- They are prohibited from committing all kinds of atrocities, extortion, etc.

**Impact of SoO pact:**

- The Kuki outfits who were initially demanding a separate Kuki state have come down to a ‘**Kukiland territorial council**’, which would have **financial and administrative powers** independent of the Manipur Assembly and government.
- **As a rehabilitation package**, the UG cadres living in the designated camps are given a monthly stipend of Rs 5000.
    - Financial assistance is also being provided to maintain the designated camps.

**What next?**

- The revocation of the SoO agreement has now raised questions about the **government’s intent** to resolve the issue earliest.
- Feeling ignored, the outfits could once again start insurgency activities **threatening the internal security of a strategically located region.**
