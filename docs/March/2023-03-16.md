**Syllabus:** **Government Policies and Interventions for Development in various sectors and Issues arising out of their Design and Implementation**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/increase-in-minimum-age-of-marriage-for-women-to-21-years-two-years-after-bill-is-notified-centre/article66622738.ece)

**Context:** The increase in the minimum age of marriage for women to 21 years as provisioned in the Prohibition of Child Marriage Amendment Bill, 2021, would come into effect two years after the Bill is notified following its passage in Parliament.

**Background:**

- According to the NFHS-5, **23%** (47% in NFHS-3 and 27% in NFHS-4 ) of women between the age of 20 and 24 were married before 18 years of age.
- In India, the practice of child marriage was **first legally prohibited** through the Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929 (legal age G = 14 years and B = 18 years)
- This Act was amended in **1978** to increase the minimum age to 18 years for females, and 21 years for men.
- **The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006** replaced the 1929 Act, with the same minimum age limits.
- In 2020, the central government set up a task force (Chairperson: **Ms Jaya Jaitly**) to examine the correlation between the age of marriage and the mother, and the child’s health.
- The Committee suggested increasing the age of marriage for females to **21**.

**The Prohibition of Child Marriage Amendment Bill 2021:** The Bill, introduced by the **Ministry of Women and Child Development** and currently with the Parliamentary Standing Committee, amends **the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act 2006**.

**Way ahead:**

- Two years from the date of notification of the amendment would **provide ample time for citizens** to prepare for this momentous reform.
- **A staggered schedule** raising the age of marriage by one year at a time, starting one year after the notification of the amendment.

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus****: International Relations – India and Neighbourhood – Border Dispute**

**Source:** [**Indian Express**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/mcmahon-line-us-senate-8499398/)

**Context**: Two United States Senators, have introduced a **bipartisan resolution in the upper chamber of Congress** reiterating that the **US recognises the McMahon Line as the international boundary between China and India in Arunachal Pradesh**.

- The resolution reaffirms **India’s well-known and established position that Arunachal Pradesh, which China calls ‘South Tibet’, is an integral part of India.**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/disputed_area.jpg?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/disputed_area.jpg)

**Fig: Disputed areas between India and China**

**What is the** [**McMahon Line**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/international-relations/india-and-its-neighborhood/india-china-relations/border-dispute-and-security-issues/mcmahon-line/)**?**

- The McMahon Line serves as the **de facto boundary between China and India in the Eastern Sector.**
- It specifically represents the **boundary between Arunachal Pradesh and Tibet, from Bhutan in the west to Myanmar in the east.**
- China has historically disputed the **boundary and claims the state of Arunachal Pradesh as part of the Tibetan Autonomous Region (TAR).**

**When was it drawn:**

- The McMahon Line was drawn during the **Shimla Convention of 1914, officially described as the Convention Between Great Britain, China, and Tibet**.
- China was represented at the convention by the **government of the Republic of China, which was in power in the mainland from 1912 to 1949.**
- The McMahon Line **delimited the respective spheres of influence of Tibet and British India in the eastern Himalayan region in what is today India’s Northeast and northern Myanmar**. The border in this region was undefined prior to the signing of the convention.

**What happened at the Shimla Convention of 1913-14?**

- The convention attempted to **settle the question of Tibet’s sovereignty and avoid further territorial disputes in the region**.
- The treaty divided the Buddhist region into “**Outer Tibet” and “Inner Tibet**” – the former would “remain in the hands of the Tibetan Government at Lhasa under Chinese suzerainty”, though China was not allowed to interfere in its affairs.
- The latter would be **under the direct jurisdiction of the newly formed Republic of China**.
- The **latter of these newly decided boundaries would later be called the McMahon Line after McMahon, the chief British negotiator.**

**Why China did not sign the convention:**

- **Arguing that Tibet had no independent authority to enter into international agreements.**

**How was the border between British India and China decided?**

- Following the **“highest watershed principle**”. This principle, considered to be **the most logical way of drawing borders in mountainous regions by the British, basically drew the border along the highest ridge between two river plains.**

**Status of the McMahon line since 1914:**

- After the communists took power in 1949, **they pulled China out of all international agreements and the so-called “unequal treaties”.**

**Various dimensions of India-US Economic relations:**

|**Dimension**|**Examples**|
|---|---|
|**Basis of commercial relations**|·         **Complementarity** of India-US economic system<br><br>·         **3D**= India’s Domestic Demand, Democracy and Demography (skilled worker)<br><br>·         **Common security interests:** US supports India’s emergence as a security provider in the Indo-Pacific as a region of peace, stability, and growing prosperity.|
|**Trade**|·         India-US bilateral trade is **valued at $157 billion (2021)**<br><br>·         India has a **Trade surplus** with the US (about $32bn in 2021)<br><br>·         **Top exports to the US:** Pharmaceuticals, Services, precious stones, and machinery<br><br>·         Mutual collaboration in **sharing of information to tackle offshore tax evasion**|
|**Investment**|·         The US is one of the largest sources of **foreign direct investment** in India (FDI inflows of **over $46 billion from 2000 to 2021)**<br><br>·         India is also one of twelve countries partnering with the United States on **the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF)**|
|**Technology and Innovation**|·         U.S.-India **Initiative on** **Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET)**<br><br>·         MoU signed on establishing a semiconductor supply chain and innovation partnership for **Supply Chain Resilience**.<br><br>·         It will complement **India’s Semiconductor Mission with US CHIPS and Science Act**<br><br>·         Agreement on **establishing a Semiconductor Sub-committee under Commercial Dialogue.**|

**Challenges in Economic Relations**:

- **Imposition of tariffs by the US** on Indian steel and aluminium products
- **India’s Atmanirbhar Bharat Campaign** has been misunderstood as **protectionism**
- **Withdrawal of duty-free benefits to Indian exporters** under the GSP programme has affected India’s export-oriented sectors
- US’ hostility towards other **countries like Iran and Russia**, who are traditional allies of India, has also created differences.
- India’s **purchase of S-400 from Russia** and the US’ policy in Afghanistan are also challenges that are affecting the India-US relationship.

**Conclusion:**

The demographic dividend in India provides a significant opportunity for technology transfer, manufacturing, trade, and investment between the US and India. There is huge potential for more commercial partnerships esp. as US companies are adopting the “China Plus One” strategy.

### [Why do landfills catch fire and what can we do about them?](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/16/why-do-landfills-catch-fire-and-what-can-we-do-about-them/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus:** **Disaster Management**

**Source:** [**TH**](http://thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/explained-why-do-landfills-catch-fire-and-what-can-we-do-about-them/article66618251.ece#:~:text=In%20summer%2C%20the%20biodegradable%20fraction,to%20go%20on%20for%20months.)

**Context:** The Kochi landfill site around Brahmapuram that caught fire was a stark reminder that Indian cities need to be prepared for more such incidents as summer approaches.

**What triggers landfill fires?**

- A landfill site is **a site for the disposal of waste materials** and is the **oldest and most common** form of waste disposal.
- The landfill sites in India are **not scientifically planned**. The efficiency of waste processing is **only 30-40%**, while India’s municipalities are collecting over 95% of the waste generated in cities.
- The wastes are **not segregated** due to which the landfill sites receive mixed wastes which **include organic waste/ignitable material/plastics**.
    - Higher temperature + flammable material = a chance for the landfill to catch fire.
- **The anaerobic decomposition** (breakdown of organic waste in the absence of oxygen) generates **methane gas and heat**.
- As soon as the methane gas comes in contact with oxygen, the combustible materials at the dumping site catch fire easily.

**Challenges:**

- The landfill fires take time to exhaust,
- The fires emit greenhouse gases,
- **Multiple ignition points,**
- **Lack of constant water supply** and
- The danger involved in climbing the tall mounds of garbage.

**Is there a permanent solution?**

- **Closing landfills in a scientific manner** (SoPs including managing the methane emissions)**.** This solution is unsuitable in the Indian context as the land can’t be used again for other purposes.
- **Clear the piles of waste through bioremediation**, i.e., excavate old waste and use automated sieving machines to segregate the flammable refuse-derived fuel (RDF) from biodegradable material.
    - The recovered RDF (plastics, rags, and clothing) can be used as fuel in **cement kilns**, and the **biosoil can be given to farmers** to improve their soil.
    - There will be a **need to landfill the harmless portion**.

**Immediate measures to manage landfill fires:**

- **Divide a site into blocks** depending on the nature of the waste.
- Blocks with fresh waste should be separated from blocks with flammable material.
- Different blocks should be **separated using a drain or soil bund** and a layer of soil should cap each block → turned regularly for aeration → helps cool the waste heap.
- The most vulnerable part of the landfill should be capped with soil.
- **In addition**,
    - Sites should be equipped with **water tankers with sprinklers**
    - The municipality should have a plan of action in advance
    - Waste-processing workers should have response training, etc.

**Way ahead:**

- The Solid Waste Management Rules 2016 state that **only non-recyclable, non-biodegradable and non-combustible waste** should go to a sanitary landfill.
- **The problem needs to be addressed at two levels** – at the level of public policy (domain of the government), and of the public itself (reducing waste generation/disposal, segregating waste).

**Best practice (Indore) – “India’s Cleanest City” for the sixth consecutive year:**

- MP’s largest city/state’s commercial capital, with a population of 35 lakh, is **garbage bin-free**, even though it **generates 1,200 tons of dry waste and 700 tons of wet waste daily.**
- While segregation of garbage into ‘dry’ and ‘wet’ categories is common, in Indore it happens in **six categories at a collection point.**

As per the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016 in India, which one of the following statements is correct?

1. Waste generator has to segregate waste into five categories.
2. The Rules are applicable to notified urban local bodies, notified towns and all industrial townships only.
3. The Rules provide for exact and elaborate criteria for the identification of sites for landfills and waste processing facilities.
4. It is mandatory on the part of the waste generator that the waste generated in one district cannot be moved to another district.

**Syllabus:** **Indian Economy and issues relating to Planning, Mobilization of Resources, Growth, Development**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/silicon-valley-bank-collapse-indian-banks-impact-8497964/)

**Context:** Recent banking crisis in the US has raised the question of how secure Indian banks are in the age of start-ups and digitisation.

**Background:**

- Despite the recent bank failures in the **US (SVB),** which occurred more than a decade and a half after the 2008 global financial crisis, **Indian banks remained unaffected**.
- India has established **Domestic Systemically Important Banks** **(D-SIBs)/Too-Big-To-Fail banks to protect itself from 2008/SVB-like episodes**.

**Too-Big-To-Fail banks:**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**What are D-SIBs?**|**How are they selected?**|**Significance**|
|●       A bank that **might substantially disrupt the financial system** (because of its size, lack of substitutability, and interconnectedness) **in the event of its failure.**<br><br>●       **In 2010**, the Switzerland-based Financial Stability Board (FSB) recommended that **all member countries should put in place a framework** to reduce risks attributable to Systemically Important Financial Institutions (SIFIs) in their jurisdictions.<br><br>●       The D-SIB framework was announced by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in **2014.**<br><br>●       RBI has classified **SBI, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank** as D-SIBs.<br><br>●       These banks have to earmark additional capital and provisions to safeguard their operations.<br><br>●       **This avoids moral hazard** due to the perception that government support at times of distress encourages risk-taking, reduces market discipline, etc.|●       The RBI follows **a two-step process**.<br><br>●       First, **a sample of banks** to be assessed for their systemic importance is decided.<br><br>○        Banks (based on Basel-III Leverage Ratio Exposure Measure) having a size beyond **2% of GDP** will be selected in the sample.<br><br>●       Next, the D-SIBs are segregated into buckets based on their systemic importance scores.<br><br>**G-SIBs:**<br><br>●       The Basel accord, in consultation with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), has identified a list of G-SIBs.<br><br>●       T**here are 30 G-SIBs currently** (none from India).<br><br>●       Including JP Morgan, Citibank, HSBC, Bank of America, Bank of China, Barclays, etc.|●       The failure of a large bank anywhere can have **a contagion effect** around the world.<br><br>●       The failure of a bank → damages confidence in the banking system → affects the domestic/global economy due to the interconnected financial systems.<br><br>●       As a result, government action was seen as being necessary for many jurisdictions to guarantee financial stability.|

**How is Indian banking unique?**

- Sound regulatory practices and **government interventions** when banks have faced difficulties **(Yes Bank).**
- **Different balance sheet structures** – household savings constitute a major part of bank deposits in India, which can’t be withdrawn in bulk quantities.
- A large chunk of Indian deposits is with **public sector banks**, and with very strong private sectors lenders such as HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank.

**Way ahead:**

- The RBI’s guidelines of 2018 advising banks to create an **Investment Fluctuation Reserve** is just the kind of countercyclical tool that has relatively insulated Indian lenders from interest rate risks.
- Still, **the RBI must remain on guard** to ensure neither global contagion nor management missteps threaten any local lender.

### **Feminist foreign policy movement**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/explained-the-feminist-foreign-policy-movement/article66606681.ece)

**A feminist foreign policy (FPP)** is a policy of a state that prioritizes peace, gender equality, and environmental integrity; and seeks to disrupt colonial, racist, patriarchal, and male-dominated power structures.

**E.g.**

- **Germany** mandates that gender equality be prioritized in its diplomatic engagement and development goals. It will allocate **8% of its development funds** to projects that specifically target gender equality, and protecting women, girls, and marginalized groups from violence.
- **Similarly, other countries**, including Canada, Chile, Mexico, France, Mongolia, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, have also adopted a feminist approach to foreign policy.

**Usage**: Similar to Gender Budgeting (as also implemented in India), the concept of Gender foreign policy can be used in International Relations, Women related Questions, PSIR and Sociology Papers.

### **Smart Metering**

**Source:** [**FE**](https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/smart-metering-infra-on-unlicensed-spectrum-not-secure-coai/3008075/)

**Context:** The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) has flagged concerns over the deployment of advanced **metering infrastructure** using unlicensed spectrum in the **865-868 MHz frequency band**

**What is Smart Meter?**

**A smart meter** is an electronic device that records information such as consumption of electric energy, voltage levels, current, and power factor.

- **Smart meters communicate** the information to the consumer for greater clarity of consumption behaviour, and electricity suppliers for system monitoring and customer billing.
- **Smart meters are part of the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) solution** that records consumers’ electricity usage at different times of the day and sends it to an energy supplier.

**What is Smart Grid?**

Smart grids are energy networks that can automatically monitor energy flows and adjust to changes in energy supply and demand accordingly.

**What is the Issue?**

**The use of unlicensed spectrum** for communication for Smart grid meters will make these systems much more prone to vulnerabilities, threats and cyber-intrusions.

**Why does Power utility use an unlicensed spectrum?**

- Unlicensed spectrum is considered an **inexpensive and barrier-free option** for meeting communication requirements.
- They currently use of **865-868 MHz band** for “Tracking, Tracing and Data Acquisition Devices” and “Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Applications”.

**Context**: Reliance Industries will introduce personal genomic mapping (PGM) to the Indian market.

**What is Genome?**

All the genetic information of an organism is called its genome. It consists of nucleotide sequences of DNA.

**What is PGM?**

Genetic mapping can offer firm evidence that a disease transmitted from parent to child is linked to one or more genes.

- **Potential**: PGM is expected to grow by **2.****4 times** by 2032.
- **Benefits**: PGM can identify and assess genes associated with a disease, and help with healthcare choices and precision medicine. PGM provides **clues about which chromosome contains the gen**e and precisely where the gene lies on that chromosome.
- **Concerns**: Ethical concerns exist around the possible use of PGM data for **“designer” babies** and the high cost involved and potential data abuse.

### **Active volcano in Venus**

**Source:** [**The Hindu**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/new-findings-say-venus-like-earth-has-eruptions-every-few-months/article66625464.ece)

**Context:**  A new analysis of radar images obtained earlier has yielded new evidence indicating **Venus is currently volcanically active.**

**More about the analysis:**

- Researchers said radar images taken by **NASA’s Magellan spacecraft** showed that a **volcanic vent about 1.6 km wide on the Venusian surface expanded and changed shape over an eight-month span in 1991**.
- The vent is **situated on Maat Mons**, which at about 9 km tall is the planet’s highest volcano and second-highest mountain.

**About Venus:**

Venus is slightly smaller than Earth. Its thick atmosphere – **mainly carbon dioxide – traps heat in a runaway greenhouse effect, rendering Venus the solar system’s hottest planet.**

### **A small shock from a metallic surface**

**Source:** [**The Hindu**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/why-it-matters-do-you-feel-a-small-shock-when-you-touch-a-metallic-surface/article66622032.ece)

**Context**: There have been stray reports from different parts of India of commuters experiencing a small electric shock when they touch metallic surfaces in public.

**About Static shocks:**

- Static shocks are technically called **electrostatic discharges**.
- The ‘shock’ is the product of the **transfer of electrons from one material to another** because they have different electrical permittivity.

**Why does it matter?**

- Electrostatic discharge happens when **electric charge (usually electrons) has accumulated somewhere.**
- If it happens when you **touch metallic surfaces in public, such as railings or lampposts, it’s because these entities haven’t been grounded properly**.
- In drier weather, **without moisture, improperly grounded objects can accumulate small charges on the surface.**
- Static **shocks are limited to a minor discomfort as long as the exposure duration** (a fraction of a second) and the amount of current transferred are both small.

### **How can the EU’s carbon tax hurt India?**

**Source:** [**The Hindu**](https://www.thehindu.com/business/watch-business-matters-how-can-eus-carbon-tax-hurt-india/article66623455.ece)

**Context:** The European Union formalised a method to **stop ‘carbon leakage’ or moving production of high-polluting products to nations outside of the EU** in its bid to go green called the **Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism.**

- CBAM is part of the EU’s plan to **cut greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, under the European Climate Law.**  

**How India will be impacted:**

- It places carbon **charge on countries that originally did not primarily cause climate change.**
- CBAM tax can charge **between 20 – 35 % which is far higher** than the EU’s average import tariff of 2.2 per cent on manufactured products
- India’s Exports to the EU account **for 15% – So exports will be affected**.
- FTA will also be affected – as **high CBAM will make them meaningless.**
