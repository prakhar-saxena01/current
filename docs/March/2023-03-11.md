### [Women’s Reservation Bill: History, politics behind long-pending law](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/11/womens-reservation-bill-history-politics-behind-long-pending-law/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus:** **Social justice (Issues related to women)**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/womens-reservation-bill-8489481/)

**Context:** Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) leader K Kavitha began a day-long hunger strike in New Delhi, demanding passage of the Women’s Reservation Bill (WRB).

[Women’s Reservation Bill](https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/issues-related-to-women/women-in-indian-political-system/way-forward/) **(WRB)**

- The Bill will reserve **one-third of the total number of seats** in state Assemblies and Parliament for women.
- It was first introduced in **1996** and was referred to a **Joint Parliamentary Committee** (chaired by Geeta Mukherjee), which recommended –
    - Reservation for a period of 15 years;
    - Including reservation in cases where the state has less than three seats in LS;
    - Including reservation for the Delhi assembly; and
    - Changing “not less than one-third” to “as nearly as may be, one-third”, etc.
- Two recommendations, which became **major sticking points** –
    - Regarding reservation for OBC women (quota within a quota)
    - Reservation for women in the Rajya Sabha and legislative council
- The Constitution (**108th Amendment**) Bill, 2008, was introduced in Parliament.
- The last attempt was made in **2010** when the WBR Bill was **passed in the** **RS but the LS never voted on it**.

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/WRB.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/WRB.png)**

**The demand for reservation for women in legislative bodies:**

- It is seen as **a logical extension of the 72nd and** [73rd constitutional amendments](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/functions-and-responsibilities-of-the-union-and-the-states-issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure-devolution-of-powers-and-finances-up-to-local-levels-and-challenges-therein/devolution-of-powers-and-finances-up-to-local-levels-and-challenges-therein/73rd-amendment-act-panchayati-raj/) (1992,1993), which reserved one-third of all seats and chairperson posts for women in rural and urban local governments.
- However, there has **never been a political consensus** on the issue.

**Women in Parliament: India and the rest of the world:**

- Just **14%** of 17th LS MPs are women (**78** in total). Women make up roughly **11%** of the RS.
- While the number has **increased significantly since the 1st LS** (5%), it is still far lower than in many countries.
- According to PRS data, **Rwanda (61%), South Africa (43%), and even Bangladesh (21%)** are ahead of India.
- According to the Inter-Parliamentary Union’s latest report, India ranks **144 out of 193 countries** in the representation of women in Parliament.

**Need for greater representation for women in legislative bodies:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Proponents**|**Opponents**|
|●        **Affirmative action** → reservation in panchayats → empowerment of women<br><br>●        **Gender-sensitive laws** **increased responsiveness**<br><br>●        **Decriminalise politics** – fewer criminal charges<br><br>●        Political participation is a **human right** regardless of its instrumental value|●        **Perpetuate unequal status** of women → would not be perceived to be competing on merit.<br><br>●        **Diverts attention from the larger electoral reform** such as the criminalization of politics, inner party democracy, etc.<br><br>●        **Restricts choice of voters to women candidates.**<br><br>●        Rotation of reserved constituencies may **reduce the incentive for an MP to work.**|

**Conclusion:** Until consensus is reached on the Women’s Reservation Bill alternate methods such as reservation in political parties, and increasing women voters’ turnout, must be undertaken.

### [Sri Lanka’s recovery | The significance of India’s support](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/11/sri-lankas-recovery-the-significance-of-indias-support/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus:** **International Relations**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/worldview-with-suhasini-haidar-sri-lankas-recovery-the-significance-of-indias-support/article66603597.ece)

**Context:** Sri Lankan President announced that the country had cleared the last hurdles to be approved for a $2.9 billion bailout from the IMF.

**Background:** The country has been reeling from the **covid crisis, economic mismanagement** by the Rajapakse regime, **mounting debts** → soaring inflation → GDP/ Exports collapse → Currency collapse.

**What the IMF bailout would mean for Sri Lanka?**

- Brings a lot of **creditworthiness** to the entire system and **confidence**.
- A lot of other agencies like the **World Bank, AIIB, and ADB**, have lined up funds to come in.
- Debt becomes more sustainable → access to the capital market → stabilizing the economy.

**How India supported its neighbor?**

- Contrary to **China**, India’s support has come unconditionally, and more promptly.
- [India’s support to Sri Lanka](https://www.insightsonindia.com/international-relations/india-and-its-neighborhood/india-sri-lanka-relations/) (worth a combined $4 bn) includes –
    - Shipments of grain, fuel, essentials, medicines
    - Credit lines
    - Debt repayment relief
    - Support at the IMF to work on the bailout package
    - Support at the G20 and BIMSTEC

**How did Sri Lanka respond to India’s support?**

- “India had really come to our rescue, **India had provided us with a lifeline** which allowed us to stay afloat during a very difficult time,” Minister of Foreign Affairs of Sri Lanka.
- In a speech on Women’s day, Sri Lankan President **thanked 3 women** – Nirmala Sitharaman, Janet Yellen, and Kristalina Georgieva for helping Sri Lanka.
- Sri Lanka is looking for **more investments from India** in IT, pharmaceuticals, the energy sector, education, etc.

**Challenges ahead:**

- **For India:**
    - **The controversy over Adani projects in Sri Lanka** (2 wind power plants in Mannar and Pooneryn areas of [northern] Sri Lanka, West Container Terminal at Colombo Port, etc).
    - The opposition had raised issues over the manner of choosing the company.
- **For Sri Lanka:** How can Sri Lanka balance its ties with China and India?
    - Sri Lanka has been **a very close friend of India** and doesn’t want to hurt I**ndia’s security concerns**.
    - Despite all the problems China is also India’s biggest [trading] partner.
    - Similarly, Sri Lanka also **wants to work with Indians and the Chinese, and the rest.**

**Conclusion:** Sri Lankan crisis and reversal is a good example for the region – it is about being more sensitive to a neighbor’s needs rather than outspending rivals.

- **Low financial literacy**
- **Limited trust in formal financial institutions**
- **Insufficient regulatory framework**
- **High transaction costs**
- **Lack of diversity in financial services**

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus:** **Money laundering-related issues**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/disclosures-ngos-pmla-rules-new-8488484/)

**Context:** The Finance Ministry has amended the [Prevention of Money Laundering Act](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/08/02/editorial-analysis-by-upholding-pmla-sc-puts-its-stamp-on-kafkas-law/) (PMLA) and rules in line with the recommendations of the FATF – the global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog.

**Background:**

- The government has been struggling to deal with the pandemic-era upsurge in advertisements soliciting **investment in virtual assets.**
- A 2021 report estimated **India with the highest number of ‘crypto owners’** (10.07 crore), more than threefold than the 2nd-ranked U.S.
- ED was investigating several cases related to **cryptocurrency frauds** wherein crypto exchanges were involved in **money laundering**.

**Why these amendments?**

- To **incorporate more disclosures for NGOs** by reporting entities like financial institutions (FIs), banking companies, or intermediaries.
- To define **“politically exposed persons”** (PEPs).

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Amendments**|**Significance**|
|●        **Defines PEPs:** As individuals who have been e**ntrusted with prominent public functions by a foreign country**, including the<br><br>○        Heads of State/Governments,<br><br>○        Senior politicians,<br><br>○        Senior government/judicial/military officers,<br><br>○        Senior executives of state-owned corporations and<br><br>○        Important political party officials<br><br>●        The amendment is **in relation to foreign PEPs** and **not domestic ones**|●        The move **brings legal uniformity and removes ambiguities** (in line with FATF norms) before India’s proposed FATF assessment.<br><br>●        This will help India **tackle illicit financial flow**s (that fuel crime and terrorism)|
|●        **‘Beneficial Owners’:** Lowered the threshold for identifying beneficial owners by reporting entities, where the client is acting on behalf of its beneficial owner.<br><br>○        The term ‘**beneficial owner**’ are those with the entitlement of **more than 25%** of shares or capital or profit of the company, **which has now been reduced to 10%**.|●        In line with the **Companies Act (2013) and Income-tax Act (1961).**<br><br>●        Bringing more **indirect participants** within the reporting net|
|●        **NPOs**: Reporting entities are now required **to register details of the client** if it’s a non-profit organization (NPO) on the **DARPAN portal** of NITI Aayog.<br><br>○        **The definition of an NPO** includes any entity or organization, constituted for religious or charitable purposes under I-T Act||
|●        **Due diligence documentation requirements:** It has now been extended.<br><br>○        It now includes the submission of details such as names of persons holding senior management positions, names of partners, etc.|●        Until now limited to obtaining the basic KYCs of clients such as registration certificates, PAN copies, etc.|
|●        **For Cryptocurrencies: V**irtual digital assets (VDA) trade has been brought under PMLA.<br><br>○        New rules **mandate crypto exchanges and intermediaries dealing in virtual assets to maintain the KYCs** of their clients and report suspicious transactions to financial intelligence units.|●        It will prevent the misuse of crypto, and NFTs through money laundering and other illegal activities.|

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/PMLA.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/PMLA.png)**

**Conclusion:** The decision to mandatorily bring all trade in virtual digital assets under the PMLA now lays the onus of ascertaining the place of origin of all activities in such assets upon individuals and businesses.

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/science-technology/scientists-call-for-legally-binding-treaty-to-protect-earth-s-orbit-here-s-why-88160)**,** [**Business Standard**](https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/scientists-call-for-legally-binding-global-treaty-to-eliminate-space-junk-123031000760_1.html#:~:text=Scientists%20have%20called%20for%20a,of%20the%20global%20space%20industry&text=International%20Space%20Station-,Scientists%20have%20called%20for%20a%20legally%20binding%20treaty%20to%20ensure,of%20the%20global%20space%20industry.)

**Context**: Scientists have called for a legally binding treaty to ensure **Earth’s orbit isn’t irreparably harmed by the future expansion of the global space industry.**

**About** [**Space debris**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/01/21/space-debris-3/#:~:text=The%20real%20amount%20of%20space,a%20satellite%20or%20a%20spacecraft.)**:**

- Space debris includes **non-functional spacecraft, abandoned launch vehicle stages, mission-related debris, and fragmentation debris.**
- Space debris can also be **generated when two satellites collide**, releasing thousands of new pieces.
- **Anti-satellite tests also result in debris.** In 2019, India tested an anti-satellite missile targeting a satellite in Low Earth Orbit (LEO).
- Space debris could **trigger a chain reaction, where too many objects collide with each other and create new space junk in the process** (known as Kessler Syndrome)
- Space debris encompasses **both natural (meteoroid) and artificial (man-made) particles.**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/kessler.jpg?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/kessler.jpg)

**Present scenario to protect Earth’s orbit:**

- **Companies are not incentivized to clean up orbits or to include de-orbiting functions in satellites**.
- De-orbiting means **bringing dead satellites back to Earth**.
- There is **no international treaty that seeks to minimize orbital debris**. But the **United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space has laid out guidelines to mitigate space debris.**
- Operators are expected to **clear the orbit within 25 years after the satellite’s mission ends.** Still, most **states have neglected to implement the necessary local space regulations, according to the letter.**

**Way forward:**

- Any agreement should include measures to **implement producer and user responsibility for satellites and debri**s, from the time they launch onward.
- Minimizing the pollution of the lower Earth **orbit will allow continued space exploration, satellite continuity, and the growth of life-changing space technology**.

**Source:** [**Indian Express**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/isro-brings-down-weather-satellite-controlled-re-entry-8489195/)

 **Context**: For the first time the **Indian Space Research Organisation** brought down a satellite in a **controlled manner after its end of life.**

- The weather satellite **Megha Tropiques-1,** which was developed as a **joint mission by Indian and French space agencies**, entered the atmosphere after the final two maneuvers and burnt up over the Pacific Ocean.

**How was the satellite brought down?**

- The Megha Tropiques satellite was launched **aboard a PSLV by the space agency in 2011.**
- Although the **planned mission life of the satellite was only three years, it continued providing data on the water cycle and energy exchanges i**n the tropics for nearly a decade.
- As some fuel was left – **it was maneuvered and brought back to earth.**

Usually, satellites are **left in their orbit and because of the gravitational pull of the earth, they come down to the atmosphere over years and years**. When the satellites re-enter the atmosphere, the **friction causes them to heat up to extremely high temperatures of thousands of degrees Celsius.** Without a heat shield, 99% of a satellite gets burnt up whether in a controlled re-entry or an uncontrolled one.

### **‘Safe harbor’ clause in IT law**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/digital-india-bill-new-law-internet-explained-8488748/)

**Context:** The government is reconsidering a key aspect of cyberspace – **‘safe harbor’**, which is the principle that allows social media platforms to avoid liability for posts made by users.

**Background:**

- The Union government formally outlined **the Digital India Bill, 2023** which is a broad overhaul of the decades-old IT Act, 2000.
- This Safe harbor has been reined in the **IT (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021**.

**What is a ‘safe harbor’?**

- Safe harbor (originally from the **US’s Communications Decency Act**) – as prescribed under **Section 79 of the IT Act, 2000** – is **legal immunity** that online intermediaries enjoy against content posted by users on their platforms.
- This is available as long as these platforms **abide by certain due diligence requirements**, such as censoring content when asked by the government or courts.
- It is a crucial tenet for **ensuring free speech on the Internet** since platforms only have to act on speech that is deemed illegal.

**Then, why revisit the norm?**

Intermediaries were synonymous with the safe harbor in the 2000s, but they have since **evolved into a variety of internet participants** with very varied functional needs.

**The core objectives of the new Digital India Bill:**

- To ensure an open and safe Internet in the country to ensure users’ rights and reduce risks for them online; **accelerate the growth of technology innovation.**
- It will also **regulate a range of crimes** that the government thinks are unique to the online space.

### **Modern and smart Power Transmission System**

**Source**: [LM](https://www.livemint.com/industry/energy/india-to-have-a-modern-and-smart-power-transmission-system-government-accepts-the-task-force-report-11678177471840.html)

**Context**: India will soon have a modern and smart power transmission system.

- The recommendations of a task force (2021) have been accepted by the Power Ministry.

**What are transmission Networks?**

Electric power transmission is the bulk movement of electrical energy from a generating site, such as a power plant, to an electrical substation. The interconnected lines that facilitate this movement form a transmission network.

**Issues with the transmission network:** India faces high aggregate technical and commercial losses (AT&C) **(around 17%, China’s is low at 5%),** which causes power shortages for consumers. Additionally, low tariffs and cross-subsidization lead to a significant difference between the average cost of supply and the average revenue generated.

**The features of smart power transmission will include:**

- **Real-time monitoring** and automated operation of the grid
- **Operation of Substations** by using modern systems like SCADA, Flexible AC Transmission devices (FACTs)
- **Predictive maintenance** using AI/ML algorithms
- **Use of Robots & Drones** in the construction and inspection of transmission assets
- **Better situational assessment**
- Capability to have an **increased share of renewable capacity** in the power-mix
- Greater resilience **against cyber-attacks** as well as natural disasters
- **Centralized and data**-driven decision-making
- **Reduction in forced outages** through self-correcting systems

**Significance**: It will reduce operations and management costs for utilities and ultimately lower power costs for consumers. It will help meet the government’s vision of providing 24×7 reliable and affordable power and meeting sustainability goals.

**Central Electricity Authority** (CEA, a **statutory** body under the Ministry of Power) will formulate standards and guidelines as per the recommendation.

### **Antibiotic drugs on livestock**

**Source:** [**The Hindu**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/veterinary-antibiotics-used-on-livestock-affects-soil-carbon-and-climate-iisc-study/article66599429.ece)

**Context**: Researchers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), have found that **grazing by livestock leads to lower carbon storage in soil compared to grazing by wild herbivores.**

- Researchers found that this **difference appears to be due to the use of veterinary antibiotics such as tetracycline on livestock.**

**More about the study:**

- The researchers said that when released into the soil through dung and urine**, these antibiotics alter the microbial communities in the soil in ways that are detrimental to sequestering carbon.**
- The study states that although soils from the wild and livestock areas had many similarities, they differed in one key parameter called **carbon use efficiency (CUE), which determines the ability of microbes to store carbon in the soil. The soil in the livestock areas had 19% lower CUE.**

**About Tetracycline:**

- Antibiotics such as **tetracycline are long-lived and can linger in the soil for decades**.
- Its use in **cats, dogs, small mammals, horses, or birds to treat bacterial infections or other conditions is ‘off label’ or ‘extra label’**.

### **Hypersonic missiles**

**Source:** [**Indian Express**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/russias-airstrike-ukraine-what-are-hypersonic-missiles-and-can-they-help-moscow-win-the-war-8489350/)

**Context**: Russia unleashed its biggest aerial strike against Ukraine, hitting critical infrastructure. Among a varied range of powerful missiles launched by Moscow, **there were six hypersonic missiles, known as Kinzhals, or Daggers.**

**What is a hypersonic missile?**

- A hypersonic missile, such as Kinzhal, is **capable of flying at least at the speed of Mach 5, i.e. five times the speed of sound, and is maneuverable**.
- The **maneuverability of the hypersonic missile is what differentiates it from a ballistic missile**, as the latter follows a set course or a ballistic trajectory.
- This makes **them extremely lethal because, by the time they are detected by ground-based radars, they are already quite near to their target.**
- There are **two types of hypersonic weapons systems**: Hypersonic Glide Vehicles (HGV) and Hypersonic Cruise Missiles. The HGVs are fired from a rocket before gliding to the intended target while the hypersonic cruise missile is powered by air-breathing high-speed engines or ‘scramjets’ after acquiring their target.

**About Kinzhal:**

- Kinzhal, is capable of **reaching speeds of Mach 10 and greater**, with a range of about 1,250 miles. The missile is also **believed to be nuclear-capable and is usually launched by MiG-31 warplanes.**
- Apart from Kinzal, Moscow reportedly has two other types of hypersonic missile systems. **One is the Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle, which can fly at speeds as high as Mach 27. And the other is the Zircon anti-ship missile**.

### **Island effect**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/dwarf-elephants-giant-rats-island-animals-8488832/)

**Foster’s Rule (or Island Effect)** is a rule in evolutionary biology describing how large-bodied species tend to downsize on islands while small-bodied species upsize.

- Members of a species get smaller or bigger depending on the resources available in the environment.

**Example**: A dwarf elephant the size of a Shetland pony once roamed the Mediterranean island of Cyprus. In the West Indies, a giant **rat-like rodent tipped** the scales at more than 400 pounds (180 kg), rivaling an American black bear.

A new study has found that the **arrival of people on the islands raised extinction rates more than tenfold.**

Islands account for up to **20% of land species and are biodiversity hotspots**, but they are under threat from hunting, habitat destruction, and the introduction of diseases and invasive predators by humans.
