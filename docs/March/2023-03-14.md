### [Trans and gay people, women sex workers can’t donate blood: What the Centre said in SC](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/14/trans-and-gay-people-women-sex-workers-cant-donate-blood-what-the-centre-said-in-sc/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Source:** [**The Hindu**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/children-of-lesbian-gay-parents-do-not-necessarily-become-lesbians-gays-sc-informs-government/article66615099.ece)**,** [**Indian Express**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/trans-gays-female-sex-workers-blood-donation-8494145/)

**Direction:** This is in continuation of yesterday’s article regarding [**legalising same-sex marriage**.](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/13/same-sex-marriages-can-rock-societal-values-centre/)

**Context:** The Centre recently told the Supreme Court, that the e**xclusion of transgenders, gay people, and female sex workers as blood donors by including them in the “at risk”** category for HIV, Hepatitis B, or C infections is based on **due consideration of scientific evidence**.

**Background:**

- The Central government’s response came after **Thangjam Singh**, a member of the transgender community, moved the Supreme Court seeking to strike **down the prohibition on gay and transgender people from donating blood under clauses 12 and 51 of the ‘Guidelines for Blood Donor Selection & Blood Donor Referral, 2017’ issued by the National Blood Transfusion Council (NBTC) and the National Aids Control Organisation on October 11, 2017.**

**Petitioners’ argument:**

- Thangjam said that such exclusion based on one’s gender identity and sexual orientation is “**completely arbitrary, unreasonable, and discriminatory and also unscientific**.”
- The plea adds that **since the blood is tested for infectious diseases like AIDS/ HIV, Hepatitis C, and B; permanently excluding persons based on their sexual preference violates their right to equality.**

**What is the government’s argument for the exclusion?**

- In its affidavit, the government said that the exclusion of transgender and gays from blood donation **is premised on scientific evidence**. The affidavit cites research from a **slew of local and international “reputed scientific journals” such as the International Journal of Community Medicine and Public Health and the International Journal of STD & AIDS.**
- The Centre also referred to the **Annual Report of the Department of Health and Family Welfare (2020-2021)** pointing to a **three to six times higher HIV prevalence among adults who are Hijras, Transgenders, MSM (Men who have sex with men), and female sex workers.**

**Context:** Growing up with lesbian or gay parents will not necessarily make a child lesbian or gay, Supreme Court confronted the government’s concern about the **“psychological” impact same-sex marriages may have on children.**

- The case involved an “**interplay” between constitutional rights of life, liberty, dignity, and equal treatment of members of the LGBTQ+ community on one side and specific statutory enactments** that consider only a married union between a biological man and woman on the other side.

### [A chance for India to shape a data governance regime](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/14/a-chance-for-india-to-shape-a-data-governance-regime/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Important aspects of governance and accountability, e-governance (applications)**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/a-chance-for-india-to-shape-a-data-governance-regime/article66615759.ece)

**Context:** [India’s G-20 presidency](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/07/editorial-analysis-indias-g20-presidency/) has provided an opportunity for the country to ensure that its digital strategies and data governance are **inclusive, transparent, secure and conducive to sustainable development.**

**Background:**

- In recent years, India has **made great strides in its digital strategies**/data governance → by embracing technology (say, UPI) and digitalisation → driving economic growth → improving the lives of citizens.
- However, the **issues of ownership** and governance of data generated and collected and **data sovereignty** have become increasingly important.
    - **Data sovereignty** is the idea that data is subject to the laws and governance structures of the nation where they are collected.
- Given this, it is unreasonable to deny people control over their data and **India’s DEPA** – a **consent management tool**, has generated both excitement and concern among stakeholders.

**Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture (DEPA):**

- It was launched by the **NITI Aayog in 2020** on the premise that individuals themselves are the best judges of the **‘right’** uses of their personal data.
- It is designed as an evolvable/agile **framework for good data governance** that empowers people to seamlessly and securely **access their data and share it with third-party institutions.**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/the-Data.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/the-Data.png)

**3 key building blocks of DEPA:**

- Enabling regulations,
- Cutting-edge technology standards, and
- New types of public and private organisations with incentives closely aligned to those of individuals.

**Advantages of DEPA:**

- Potential to improve **data protection and privacy** for citizens
- Allowing individuals to **easily manage and control** their data consent
- **Build trust** in digital technologies and data governance.

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/the_data_emp.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/the_data_emp.png)

**Risks associated with DEPA:**

- Personal data could be **misused or misappropriated** if the consent management tool is not properly implemented.
- An implementation may be **inconsistent across different sectors and jurisdictions** → undermine effectiveness, **and create confusion** among citizens.

**Way ahead:**

- The DEPA must be implemented in a **transparent, consistent and secure** manner → requires close collaboration **between all the stakeholders.**
- Clear, transparent and accountable data governance policies and regulations.
    - **India Data Management Office** (IDMO) proposed by MeitY will frame/manage review/revise the **National Data Governance Framework Policy** (NDGFP).
- Investment in the **necessary digital infrastructure and skills**.
    - [India Stack](https://indiastack.org/) is a unified software platform that provides digital public goods, and application interfaces and facilitates digital inclusion.
- Advances in financial inclusion (UPI) can be **replicated** successfully in other areas (health, agriculture).
- **International cooperation and collaboration** in addressing risks posed by the rapid growth of data and digital technologies.

**Conclusion:** It is important for India to navigate a **middle way** between restrictive data sovereignty and limitless data flow for the development of **ethical and responsible data governance practices**.

### [IPES report highlights global hunger crisis amid high debt](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/14/ipes-report-highlights-global-hunger-crisis-amid-high-debt/)

**GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus:** **Issues relating to Poverty and Hunger**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/food/ipes-report-highlights-global-hunger-crisis-amid-high-debt-88201#:~:text=Published%3A%20Monday%2013%20March%202023&text=At%20least%2021%20countries%20%E2%80%94%20including,according%20to%20a%20new%20report.)

**Context:** According to a special report by the IPES-Food, **at least 21 countries were nearing catastrophic levels of both debt distress and rising hunger in 2022.**

[International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems](https://www.ipes-food.org/) **(IPES-Food):** **Since 2015**, this diverse and independent panel of experts has uniquely shaped the debate on global food systems reform, through policy-oriented research and direct engagement with policy processes.

**Highlights of the report – ‘Breaking the cycle of unsustainable food systems, hunger and debt’:**

- **Global public debt** was at its highest levels in almost 60 years and countries were having to choose between repaying debts and feeding people.
    - **21 countries** (including **Afghanistan, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Haiti, and Sri Lanka**) were nearing **catastrophic levels of both debt distress and rising hunger**.
    - This is even when r**ecord-high food prices have receded currently**, a year after Russia’s war on Ukraine.
- **About 60% of low-income countries and 30% of middle-income countries** were considered at high risk of debt distress.
- The world’s poorest countries **saw the costs of servicing their debt increase by 35% in 2022.**
- They paid 47% of external debt payments to private lenders, 12% to China, 14% to other governments and the remaining to multilateral institutions like the IMF.

**On India:**

- **Several countries are now stuck in what has been described as a ‘fertilizer trap’**: India (with $26 billion budgeted in 2022), Kenya, and the Philippines are among a host of governments ramping up fertilizer subsidies in the face of the crisis, alongside rising fuel import costs.

**Success case study:** 

**Natural farming (Andhra Pradesh)**: In contrast to Sri Lanka’s botched top-down organic transition, the **Indian state of Andhra Pradesh has engaged some 620,000 farmers** in a sequenced transition to chemical-free, **‘natural farming’**, with initial data suggesting higher household incomes, yield increases, cost savings, improved quality of soils and crops, as well as reduced stress and better health.

**Reasons behind this crisis:**

- **Import dependencies** (Africa’s food import dependency has tripled → food price spikes), extractive financial flows, boom-bust commodity cycles and unsustainable/climate-vulnerable food systems.
- **Higher costs for imports and debt repayments.**
- This required them to **earn dollars via crop exports** (to pay down their debts) rather than meeting local food needs.

**How will this impact countries?**

- A debt crisis could plunge millions more into **hunger, and poverty**
- Reversing decades of progress and s**parking further instability and conflict**

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/what_is.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/what_is.png)**

**Way ahead:**

- The report called for **urgent action to provide debt relief and development finance** on a scale to meet the needs of
    - COVID-19 recovery,
    - Climate-resilient food systems and
    - [Sustainable development goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) (SDGs).
- It also urged policymakers **to repair historical injustices** that have left countries **funnelling profits and exports to the global North.**
- For this, **windfall taxes on food profiteers** and steps to achieve **tax justice, and** [climate justice](https://www.unicef.org/globalinsight/what-climate-justice-and-what-can-we-do-achieve-it#:~:text=This%20entails%20ensuring%20representation%2C%20inclusion,in%20healthy%20and%20clean%20environments.) are needed as soon as possible.

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus**:  Important International institutions.

**Source:** [**Indian Express**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/bhutan-graduated-least-developed-country-status-explained-8492253/)

**Context:** Bhutan will become the **seventh nation to graduate from the United Nations (UN) list of Least Developed Countries (LDC).**

[**What is a Least Developed Country (LDC)?**](https://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/least-developed-country-category.html#:~:text=Least%20developed%20countries%20(LDCs)%20are,low%20levels%20of%20human%20assets.)

According to the UN, an LDC is defined as “**a country that exhibits the lowest indicators of socioeconomic development, with low levels of income, human capital and economic diversification, high levels of economic vulnerability, and a population that is disproportionately reliant on agriculture, natural resources, and primary commodities.”**

The UN identifies **three criteria for a country to be classified as an LDC:**

- It must have a **gross national income (GNI) per capita below the threshold of USD 1,230 over a three-year average.**
- It must **perform poorly on a composite human assets index** based on indicators including **nutrition, health and education**.
- The country must **demonstrate economic vulnerability** such as being prone to natural disasters and possessing structural economic constraints.

**How does a country get off the LDC list?**

- A nation must have a **GNI per capita of at least USD 1,242 for two consecutive triennial reviews** in order to meet the income requirement.
- By using measures like education, health, and nutrition, a nation must show that it has improved its **human capital in order to achieve the human assets requirement**.
- A nation also must show that it has **improved its ability to withstand external economic shocks like natural catastrophes or shifts in commodity prices in order to pass the economic vulnerability test.**

**Advantages of being an LDC**

- Being an LDC confers certain economic benefits to the listed country.
- LDCs also enjoy **duty-free and quota-free (DFQF) access to the markets of developed countries**.
- LDCs are also eligible for loans with special terms for development, which include loans with a lower interest rate and a longer repayment time than those given to other nations.

**Context**:  The **Fifth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries (LDC5)** concluded with the adoption of the ‘**Doha Political Declaration’ by world leaders.**

With just under eight years left to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, the declaration focuses on implementing the **Doha Programme of Action (DPoA) — the 10-year plan to put the world’s 46 most vulnerable countries back on track to achieving the UN-mandated Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).** 

DPoA (2022-2031) consisted of six key focus areas including eradicating poverty, leveraging the potential of science and technology to fight against multidimensional vulnerabilities and to achieve the SDGs, addressing climate change, and environmental degradation, recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic and building resilience against future shocks for risk-informed sustainable development.

 **Context:** India’s petroleum product exports to the EU have increased considerably over the past months as the region reduces imports of refined products from Russia, [due to the war in Ukraine](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/11/editorial-analysis-lessons-from-russias-ukraine-war/).

**Background:**

- India is a major refiner with an annual refining capacity of about **250 million tonnes.**
- While it is also one of the top consumers of crude oil, **India’s refining capacity is higher than its domestic demand**.

**What does the data show?**

- India’s petroleum product exports to the EU **rose 20.4%** year on year in April-January to **6 million tonnes**, with the region climbing to the top 20 regions importing refined products from India.
- According to the Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics (DGCIS) data, **Indian refiners (particularly private) are rushing to partly fill the supply gap for the region**.

**Why does the rise matter? From the global oil markets perspective**, suppliers like India are helping maintain a demand-supply balance, while preventing extreme price shocks.

**Benefits for India:**

- **Indian refiners**, particularly export-oriented private sector players (Reliance Industries and Nayara Energy), **stand to gain** (purchase Russian oil at a discount).
- India now finds itself **playing an increasingly prominent role in the global crude oil and refined products supply map.**

**What is the West’s view on rising Indian exports to the EU?**

- While the West was irked at India’s rising purchases of Russian oil, countries like the US are **comfortable with the rising supply of Indian refined products to the EU**.
- They see it as **critical for the success of the price caps on Russian oil and refined products** (imposed by G7 countries) without causing a global supply shock.

### **Scientists devise ‘glowscope’ to bring fluorescent microscopy to schools**

**Source:** [**The Hindu**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/scientists-devise-glowscope-to-bring-fluorescent-microscopy-to-schools/article66607143.ece)

**Context**: Researchers at Winona State University, Minnesota**, have created a design for a ‘glowscope**’, a device that could **democratise access to fluorescence microscopy.**

**What is fluorescence microscopy?**

- A fluorescence microscope views an object by studying how it **reemits light that it has absorbed, i.e. how it fluoresces.**
- The object is illuminated with light of a specific wavelength. Particles in the object absorb this light and reemit it at a higher wavelength (i.e. different colour). These particles are called fl**uorophores**; the **object is infused with them before being placed under the microscope**.

**Context**: According to a new study the **smoke from recent wildfires is threatening to slow and even reverse the recovery of Earth’s ozone layer.**

[**About the Ozone layer:**](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/ozone-layer/)

- The ozone layer is the protective **cover shielding the Earth from the Sun’s damaging ultraviolet radiation**.

**More about the study:**

- Researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the US noted that a **wildfire can pump smoke up into the stratosphere, where the particles drift for over a year.**
- The researchers **identified a new chemical reaction by which smoke particles from the Australian wildfires made ozone depletion worse.**
- By triggering this reaction, **the fires likely contributed to a 3-5% depletion of total ozone at mid-latitudes in the Southern Hemisphe**re, in regions overlying Australia, New Zealand, and parts of Africa and South America.
