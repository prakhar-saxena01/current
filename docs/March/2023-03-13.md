**Limitations:**

These limitations included **social restrictions** that confined women to traditional roles, a **lack of education** that limited their participation and communication abilities, **limited access to resources**, **gender discrimination** within the movement, and a **patriarchal society** that did not consider women equal to men, resulting in their voices being silenced and opinions not taken seriously.

**Conclusion:**

Despite these limitations, many women played a significant role in the independence movement, paving the way for future generations of women to follow.

### [Same-sex marriages can rock societal values: Centre](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/13/same-sex-marriages-can-rock-societal-values-centre/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus: Social Justice – vulnerable sections**

**Source:** [**The Hindu**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/same-sex-marriages-can-rock-societal-values-centre/article66610499.ece#:~:text=Same-sex%20marriages%20can%20rock%20societal%20values%3A%20Centre%20Any,%7C%20Updated%2010%3A20%20pm%20IST%20-%20NEW%20DELHI)

**Context:** The Centre has opposed the Supreme Court pleas seeking **legal validation of same-sex marriage,** saying it would cause **complete havoc with the delicate balance of personal laws and accepted societal values.**

- According to the government marriage between a biological man and woman is a **“holy union, a sacrament and a sanskar” in India.**
- Any “deviation” from this “statutorily, religiously and socially” accepted norm in “human relationships**” can only happen through the legislature and not the Supreme Court**.

**What were the petitioners’ demands:**

- Sought an **interpretation of the** [**Special Marriage Act, 1954**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/02/10/special-marriage-act/#:~:text=What%20is%20Special%20Marriage%20Act,solemnized%20by%20way%20of%20registration.) **in a gender-neutral manner** where a person is not discriminated against due to his sexual orientation.
- The Special Marriage Act of 1954 provides a civil form of marriage for couples who cannot marry under their personal law.

**Governments arguments:**

- The government argued that the **Court had only decriminalised sexual intercourse between same-sex persons in its 2018 judgment in** [**Navtej Singh Johar**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/issues-related-to-third-gender-lgbtqia/section377/), and **not legitimised this “conduct”.**
- The court, while decriminalising homosexuality, **had never accepted same-sex marriage as part of the fundamental right to life and dignity under Article 21 of the Constitution.**
- Registration of marriage of same-sex persons **would also result in violation of existing personal as well as codified law provisions.**

It is submitted that **there cannot be an untrammelled right under Article 21 and cannot override other constitutional principles**, adding that Parliament has designed and framed marriage laws, which are **governed by personal laws/codified laws relatable to customs of various religious communities, to recognise only the union of a man and a woman to be capable of legal sanction, and thereby claim legal and statutory rights and consequences**.

**Ethical aspects of Same-sex marriage**

**Equality**: Denying same-sex couples the right to marry is seen as discrimination and a violation of basic human rights.

**Consent**: Same-sex couples should be able to marry if they are both consenting adults who are making a free and informed decision to enter into a lifelong commitment.

**Harm**: Opponents of same-sex marriage argue that it is harmful to society or to children who may be raised by same-sex couples.

- However, many studies have found that there is no evidence to support these claims and that children raised by same-sex parents do just as well as children raised by opposite-sex parents.

**Tradition**: Some people argue that same-sex marriage goes against traditional values and beliefs.

- However, tradition is not always a reliable guide to ethics, and there is no inherent ethical value in maintaining a tradition simply because it is old or familiar.

**Religious beliefs**: For some, same-sex marriage may conflict with their religious beliefs. While everyone has the right to their own beliefs, it is important to remember that religious beliefs should not be used to justify discrimination or deny equal rights to others.

### [What caused Silicon Valley Bank’s failure?](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/13/what-caused-silicon-valley-banks-failure/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus:** **Indian economy and related issues**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/silicon-valley-bank-failure-2008-financial-crisis-8492382/)

**Context:** The downfall of the US-based Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) is the **largest failure of a financial institution** since the [global financial crisis of 2008.](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/13/mission-2023-insights-daily-current-affairs-pib-summary-13-march-2023/What%20caused%20Silicon%20Valley%20Bank's%20failure?)

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SVB.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SVB.png)

**What went wrong at SVB?**

- The financial institution best known for its relationships with high-flying world technology startups and venture capital **experienced a bank run**.
- **A bank run**, which is **typically the result of panic** (customers withdraw their deposits simultaneously) rather than true insolvency, **pushes a bank into actual insolvency.**
- Bank runs have occurred throughout history including during the **Great Depression and the 2008-09 financial crisis.**

**What happens next?**

- **The SVB’s large deposits** (startups and wealthy tech workers) are unsafe**.**
    - The Federal government insures deposits to **$250,000** and anything above it is considered uninsured and likely to be released in an orderly process.
    - But many businesses want to access funds **to meet payroll and office expenses** → could lead to furloughs/layoffs.
- **There’s no buyer of SVB.**

**Is this a sign of a repeat of the 2008 global financial crisis?**

- SVB was large but had a unique existence by servicing nearly exclusively the technology world and VC-backed companies.
- **Other banks are far more diversified** across multiple industries, customer bases and geographies and **could survive a deep recession and a significant rise in unemployment**.
- However, if the **‘contagion effects**’ from SVB or higher interest rates hit more foreign banks, **a flight to safety among global investors** could hit capital flows into emerging markets.
    - The contagion effect explains the possibility of **the spread of economic crisis or boom** across countries or regions.
    - The fundamental underlying this scenario where **price movements** in one market are resultant of shocks or volatility in the other market is a **perfect information flow.**

**Impact on the Indian economy?**

- Many Indian start-ups [especially in the SaaS (software as a service) sector] **not only have accounts**, but the bank had also been an important **lender**.
- **For example,** an investment of a total of $1.7 million in One97 Communications, the parent company of Paytm.
- As the funding for start-ups is dwindling, this could prove to be a major roadblock, especially for **young businesses**.
- The flight of capital could also impact the

### [The rise of the ESG regulations](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/13/the-rise-of-the-esg-regulations/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus:** **Conservation, Environmental Pollution and Degradation, Environmental Impact Assessment/Corporate Governance**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/explained-the-rise-of-the-esg-regulations/article66610907.ece)

**Context:** The evolution of [environmental, social and governance (ESG)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/08/25/do-you-think-environmental-social-and-governance-esg-can-lead-to-shifts-in-environmental-economic-and-social-systems-of-the-country-critically-examine/) laws and regulations are still at a nascent stage in India.

**Background:**

- Businesses should be measured not just on traditional economic metrics (shareholder return), but also by their –
    - **Environmental impact,**
    - **Commitment to social issues** and the
    - **The soundness of their corporate governance** and protection of shareholder rights.
- Companies have **a distinct responsibility as corporate citizens** and the ESG considerations in a company’s risk profile are needed to accurately assess the enterprise.

**How ESG differs from** [corporate social responsibility (CSR)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/10/30/corporate-social-responsibility/#:~:text=What%20is%20Corporate%20Social%20Responsibility,corporation's%20business%20model%20and%20culture.)**?**

- India has a robust CSR policy codified in the **Companies Act 2013,** mandating that corporations engage in initiatives that contribute to the welfare of society by **spending at least 2%** of their net profit over the preceding 3 years on CSR activities.
- ESG regulations differ in process and impact. **For example,** The U.K. Modern Slavery Act requires companies **to publish the efforts they have taken** to identify the risks of child labour in their supply chain, etc.

**Current focus of India:** Places more emphasis on protecting the environment or working conditions than on implementing the controls and disclosure that are essential components of modern ESG legislation.

**Attempts to bring ESG legislation in India:**

- India has a number of laws and bodies regarding ESG issues, including
    - The **Environment Protection Act of 1986**,
    - Quasi-judicial organisations such as the **National Green Tribunal**,
    - A range of labour codes and laws governing **corporate governance practices.**
- While these provide important environmental and social safeguards, **new initiatives establish guidelines** for monitoring, quantification and disclosure, akin to ESG.
- **For example,** SEBI revised the annual Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (**BRSR**) required by the 1,000 largest listed companies in India, mandating disclosures from GHG emissions to **gender and social diversity**.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Challenges for Indian companies**|**Implications for Indian companies**|**Way ahead**|
|●        Compliance with ESG regulations (both originating in India and elsewhere – US, UK, EU), **pose a significantly different challenge** than India’s CSR regulations.<br><br>●        Ownership that is obscured through **shell companies** can present additional challenges.|Compliance will be essential if India wants to fully benefit from the **growing decoupling from China and play a more significant role in global supply chains**.|Thorough due diligence (for assessing risks and controls) will play a key role.|

**Conclusion:** Companies that wish to maximise their opportunities in the global economy need to embrace these new requirements and adjust their organisations accordingly.

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/supreme-court-compassionate-appointment-ruling-8492120/#:~:text=In%20a%20judgment%20delivered%20on,government%20employees%20in%20West%20Bengal.)

**Context:** The SC rejected applications for ‘compassionate appointment’ that were filed by the dependents of deceased government employees in West Bengal, as it is not a vested right.

**What are compassionate appointments?**

- The concept can be traced to the Indian Constitution’s **Article 39** (DPSP), which talks about the **right to livelihood**.
- **It aims to provide employment on compassionate grounds** to the dependent family members of a government servant who dies/retires on medical grounds.
- According to the DoPT, these appointments can only be made for **Group ‘C’** posts against the direct recruitment quota.
- The measure can also extend to the family members of an **Armed Forces employee**.

**Who is empowered to make these appointments?** Either the Secretary/Joint Secretary of a Ministry or Department concerned or the Head of the Department in the case of attached and subordinate offices.

**What has the court said now?**

- **Existence of a policy issued by the State Government** is a sine qua non for making appointments on a compassionate basis.
- Even if the policy existed, it would be of no use to consider the applications **several years after they were filed.**
- There **shouldn’t be any delay in such appointments** and the same should be provided immediately to redeem the family in distress.

**Context:** The **Ministry of Power** has launched a High Price Day Ahead Market and Surplus Power Portal (PUShP) – an initiative to ensure greater availability of power during the peak demand season.

- The portal will allow **DISCOMs to indicate their surplus power**, which can be requisitioned by those in need

**About HP-DAM**

HP-DAM will offer costly power (from gas-based, imported-coal-based power plants, and renewable energy stored in battery-energy storage systems) on a need basis through power exchange

**Day-Ahead Energy Market**: Participants purchase and sell electric energy for the following day.

**About PUShP**

PUShP will ensure **better utilization of power capacity** at a reasonable rate and prevent power producers from charging exorbitant prices. It will **aggregate excess power generation capacity** on a national basis, offering Discoms a view of the supply and demand scenario

**Other Portals:**

- **PRAKASH** **Portal** (improving coordination between the power, coal and railway ministries to ensure coal supplies to power plants)
- **GARV App** (for monitoring rural electrification programme)

**Context**: The space agencies of the **United States (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) and Italy – Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI)** will launch the [**Multi-Angle Imager for Aerosols (MAIA)**](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/multi-angle-imager-for-aerosols-maia) **missions to investigate the health impacts of air pollution in the world’s most populated cities**

**About MAIA:**

- MAIA is a **state-of-the-art satellite instrument**producing data that **will be used in health studies to examine the health effects of various types of air pollution**.
- The MAIA mission will **collect and analyse data from the observatory, sensors on the ground and atmospheric models**
- Its measurements of sunlight **reflecting off airborne particles will help researchers determine the abundance, size and optical properties of certain pollutants in the atmosphere.** 

Using such data in conjunction with surface-based measurements will help researchers decipher the particles’ chemical composition. Those results will then be **related to human birth, death and hospitalisation records to answer pressing questions about the health impacts of solid and liquid particles contaminating the air we breathe.** 

### **Net-zero waste to be mandatory for buildings**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/government-to-ensure-net-zero-waste-from-buildings/article66610880.ece)

**Context:** According to the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, all upcoming housing societies and commercial complexes in the country will soon mandatorily have to ensure **net zero waste.**

**Background:**

- The directive is part of the **Manhole to Machine-hole scheme** for the complete removal of manual scavenging and has been formulated as a convergence of programmes like **Swachch Bharat, NAMASTE** and **AMRUT**.
- India currently generates **72,368 million** litres per day of urban wastewater of which only 28% is treated.
- According to a 2021 report – ‘**Circular Economy in Municipal Solid and Liquid Waste**’, if the sale of treated sewage is institutionalised, it can add close to ₹3,285 crore annually.
- **The UN SDG 6.3** aims at halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally by 2030.

**What does achieving net zero waste mean?**

- Reducing, reusing, and recovering waste streams (sludge) to convert them to valuable resources so that **zero solid waste is sent to landfills.**
- Net zero waste along with the treatment of liquid discharge will be part of the government’s push for **reforming and modernising the sewage disposal system**.

**The Ministry is also looking at:**

- **Integrating septic tank design** into the building by-laws,
- **Geo-tagging** all septic tanks and manholes for proper tracking,
- Reducing GST on mechanised cleaning vehicles.
