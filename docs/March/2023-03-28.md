#### **GS Paper 1**

 **Syllabus:** **Important Geophysical Phenomena**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/without-action-plans-indias-poorest-will-continue-to-bear-brunt-of-heatwaves-study/article66668156.ece)

 **Context:** A new report by the think-tank Centre for Policy Research on **“How is India Adapting to Heatwaves?**” indicates that the country is ill-prepared to face the heat.

**Background:**

- Landmark heatwaves (1998, 2002, 2010, 2015, 2022) have **led to large death tolls and extensive economic damage** by reducing labour productivity and affecting water availability, agriculture and energy systems.
- Governments across India have responded by creating **heat action plans** (HAPs), which prescribe a variety of measures (to decrease the impact of heatwaves) –
    - Preparatory activities
    - Post-heatwave response
- The report analysed **37 HAPs** at the city (9), district (13) and State (15) levels across 18 States, to evaluate how policy action is keeping up with the warming weather in India.

**Findings of the report:**

- [**Heat waves**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/04/07/what-are-heat-waves/) (prolonged periods of extreme heat) **have increased in frequency** in recent decades due to [climate change](https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/climate-change-and-associated-issues/).
- HAPs are not built for local contexts.
- Nearly all HAPs –
    - Fail to identify and target vulnerable groups
    - Are **underfunded** with weak legal foundations → reduces bureaucratic incentives to prioritise and comply with HAPs instructions
    - Are insufficiently transparent
- Only 2 HAPs carry out and present **vulnerability assessments** (systematic studies to locate where the people most likely to be affected are in a city, district, or State).
- There is **no national repository of HAPs** and very few HAPs are listed online.

**Indian govt initiatives to deal with the impact of heat waves:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Imitative**|**Explanation**|
|**Mission LiFE (Lifestyle for Environment)**|To promote sustainable lifestyles and practices that conserve the environment and have climate co-benefits.|
|**Environment Education Programme (EEP)**|To sensitise children/youth, on issues related to the environment and to motivate them to adopt sustainable lifestyles.|
|**National Programme on Climate Change and Human Health:**|To increase public awareness on the subject of the health impacts of climate change including heat waves.|
|**India Meteorological Department (IMD)**|**I**ssues colour-coded impact-based heat wave warnings for public benefit through mass media.|
|**The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and IMD**|**They** are working with 23 States prone to high temperatures leading to heat-wave conditions for supporting HAPs.|
|**Water Technology Initiative (WTI):**|Aims to develop research-based solutions for existing and emerging water challenges facing the country in the area of water quality, quantity, water reuse and recycling.|
|**Per Drop More Crop (PDMC) scheme**|It focuses on enhancing water use efficiency at the farm level through micro irrigation viz. drip and sprinkler irrigation systems|
|**The Startup India Seed Fund scheme (SISFS)**|Under the Startup India initiative, the scheme provides –<br><br>○       ‘Simpliﬁcation and handholding’,<br><br>○       ‘Funding support and incentives’ and<br><br>○       ‘Industry- academia partnership and incubation’ for, prototype development, etc.|

**Recommendations:**

- **HAPs must identify sources of financing** – either from new funds or by combining actions with existing national and State policies.
- Set up **rigorous independent evaluation**s as a basis for constant improvement.
- **Raise public awareness** on issues related to environmental sustainability and climate change.

**Conclusion:**

Without implementation-oriented HAPs, India’s poorest will continue to suffer from extreme heat, paying with both their health and incomes.

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus: Governance: RTI**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-gives-states-uts-and-high-courts-three-months-to-set-up-online-rti-portals/article66660885.ece#:~:text=The%20Supreme%20Court%20has%20directed,to%20ensure%20transparency%20in%20governance.)

 **Context:** The Supreme Court has directed **States and Union Territories** to set up and operationalize **online** [**Right to Information**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/governance/governance-important-aspects/transparency/right-to-information-act/) **(RTI) portals** within three months to **ensure transparency in governance.**

**What is RTI?**

The Right to Information Act 2005 (RTI) gives **Indian citizens the right to access information held by public authorities (**all levels of government, judiciary, as well as any non-governmental organizations that receive public funding).

**Genesis of RTI act:**

In 1986, the Indian Supreme Court ruled in the **case of Mr Kulwal v/s Jaipur Municipal Corporation** that the freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under **Article 19** of the Indian Constitution includes the right to information.

**Objectives:**

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/rti_act.jpg?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/rti_act.jpg)**

**Why Online Portal?**

 **Section 6(1) of RTI, 2005** stipulated that an information seeker had a **statutory right to move an application through electronic means**.

**Issues with the online portal:**

- Even after 17 years of the act being passed, **several High Courts and most district courts** entertain **only physical RTI applications**.
- Issues of the **‘**[**digital divide’**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/science-technology/communication-and-it-technology/digital-divide/#:~:text=Digital%20divide%20is%20any%20uneven,or%20geopolitical%20criteria%2C%20or%20otherwise.), **lack of digital infrastructure**, and **lack of digital literacy** hamper RTI progress.

Recently, **Supreme Court and some HCs in Madhya Pradesh**, Odisha, and Delhi have set up an online portal facilitating requests for the supply of information.

**More about Section 6 of the RTI Act**

- A person who desires to obtain any information under this Act can do so **in writing or through electronic means.**
- **Language:**English/Hindi/official language of the area
- **Fee**: Prescribed fee.
    - **No need to disclose the reasons**: For making the request or their personal details except for such information that might be required for contacting them.

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: Governance**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/reduce-civil-services-recruitment-cycle-assess-reason-for-candidates-low-turnout-par-panel-to-upsc/article66663970.ece?cx_testId=12&cx_testVariant=cx_1&cx_artPos=2&cx_experienceId=EXT8TLE3MA2V#cxrecs_s)

**Context:** Asserting that the **nearly 15 months long recruitment process wastes** candidates’ prime years besides taking a **heavy toll on their physical and mental health**, a Parliamentary Committee has asked the UPSC to reduce the civil services examination’s selection cycle

**Major Recommendations of the Parliamentary Panel:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Recommendations**|**Benefits**|
|**Reduce the civil services examination’s selection cycle**|Reduced recruitment duration, the **less physical and mental strain** on candidates.|
|**Examine reasons for the low turnout of candidates**|Improved **understanding** **of barriers** to participation and ways to increase participation rates.|
|**Furnish details of examination fees collected**|Improved **transparency** in fee collection and expenditure.|
|**Form an expert committee to assess the equal opportunity**|Improved **equity** in the recruitment process.|
|**Appoint an expert group to assess the impact of changes**|**More informed decision-makin**g on changes to recruitment scheme and syllabus.|
|**Publish the answer key after the preliminary stage of the exam**|Improved **transparency** and fairness in the examination process.|
|**Collect feedback and effect improvements**|Improved **candidate experience and fairness** in the examination process.|

**Suggestions by other Committee for recruitment**

|   |   |
|---|---|
||**Suggested Reforms**|
|**Hota Committee**|Reduction in the age limit for general category candidates<br><br>from 32 to 26 years; Introduction of a common preliminary examination for all<br><br>central services|
|**2nd ARC Report**|Introduction of lateral entry of specialists into civil<br><br>Services; Recruitment of specialists through domain-specific<br><br>Examinations; Strengthening the training and capacity-building of civil<br><br>servants|

**Other issues with Civil Services in India**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Issue**|**Description**|
|**Conversion of ICS into IAS**|No attempts were made to link IAS with India’s philosophy of public administration, thereby prolonging the colonial attitude of civil servants.|
|**Excessive Element of Security**|[**Article 311**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/05/19/article-311-of-the-constitution/#:~:text=Article%20311(1)%3A%20It,by%20which%20he%20was%20appointed.) **of the Constitution of India** acts as a safeguard for civil servants so that they are not dismissed arbitrarily from service. However, security cover provides them with a **sense of permanency in power**, and their behaviour often shows a **total disregard for transparency and accountability**.|
|**Lack of Specialisation**|It makes it impractical for them to handle assignments that require specific expertise.|
|**Absence of Systematic Mechanism**|There is no inbuilt mechanism for the **re-inculcation of sense of purpose and motivation** in the civil services. The absence of such a mechanism can lead to insensitivity and lack of concern.|

**Reform initiatives taken in recent years:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Initiatives**|**Description**|
|[**Mission Karmayogi**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/10/14/mission-karmyogi-an-attempt-to-change-the-face-of-civil-services/)|National Programme for Civil Services Capacity Building (NPCSCB)|
|**Lateral Entry Reform**|Personnel from the private sector are selected for administrative posts in the government|
|**e-Samiksha**|Real-time online system for monitoring and follow-up action on government decisions|
|[**Citizen Charters**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/governance/citizen-charters/)|Mandated for all Ministries/Departments and regularly updated and reviewed|
|**National Conference on e-Governance**|The platform for engagement with experts and intellectuals to exchange experiences relating to e-Governance initiatives|
|**CPGRAMS**|Online system for lodging and tracking grievances|
|**National e-Governance Service Delivery Assessment**|Assessment of the efficiency of e-Governance service delivery by States, UTs, and Central Ministries.|

**Conclusion:**

Civil services reform esp. in recruitment and training, is necessary to enhance administrative capability in response to new challenges faced by the state institution managing public affairs.

**Syllabus: Internal Security**

**Source:** [**TOI**](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/centre-to-reduce-disturbed-areas-tag-under-afspa-from-many-northeast-districts/articleshow/99003260.cms)**,** [**TOI**](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-editorials/go-afspa-go-every-n-e-district-freed-of-this-draconian-law-represents-an-advance-but-its-time-to-consider-full-repeal/)

**Context:** The Centre has decided to **decrease** the jurisdiction of “disturbed areas” declared under the [**Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958 (AFSPA)**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/04/29/armed-forces-special-powers-act-afspa-7/) in Nagaland, Assam and Manipur from April 1st.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**About AFSPA**|**Description**|
|**Definition**|Areas declared as “**disturbed’’ under Section 3 of AFSPA** due to a “dangerous” or “disturbed” situation.|
|**What are “Disturbed areas”?**|When a **part or whole state/UT** is in such a condition that the use of armed forces in aid of civil power is necessary.|
|**Who can declare a “disturbed area”?**|It can be declared by the **Governor** of state or **administrator** of Union Territory or by the **Central** government.|
|**Purpose**|It grants **special powers** to armed forces to maintain public order in “disturbed areas.|
|**Powers**|Armed forces can use force, arrest without a warrant, search without a warrant, and shoot to kill|
|**AFSPA completely withdrawn in**|**Meghalaya** (2018), **Tripura** (2015) and **Mizoram** (1980s)|
|**AFSPA in effect**|**Nagaland** (8 out of 9 districts), **Assam** (8 districts), **Manipur** (except a few areas), the whole of **Jammu and Kashmir** and parts of **Arunachal Pradesh**|
|**Need for AFSPA in North-east**|Protection of members of armed forces; To handle involvement of proxy groups; dissuade advancement of terrorist activities; To handle insurgency and militancy-affected areas|

**Issues with the use of AFSPA**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Issue**|**Explanation**|
|**Violation of human rights**|·        It has been dubbed as a ‘**license to kill’**;<br><br>·        **Justice Verma committee** (on offences against women in conflict areas) said “AFSPA legitimizes impunity for sexual violence”;<br><br>·        **Justice Santosh Hegde Committee** described it as a **“symbol of oppression”.**|
|**Cases of fake encounters**|For instance, the Extrajudicial Execution Victim Families Association of Manipur filed a case in the Supreme Court alleging **1,528 fake encounters** **between 1979 and 2012.**|
|**Opposition by the state government**|States like Nagaland, Tripura, and Manipur have constantly opposed its imposition.|
|**Poor checks and balance**|The Act gives powers to security forces to open fire but only after a prior warning is given to the suspect. There is a **lack of accountability**.|
|**Poor investigation**|In Manipur, with the Supreme Court taking up the extra-judicial killings, the **CBI has investigated only 39 cases (94 killings).**|
|**Fuels the cycle of violence**|People’s **disillusionment with the democratic setup** is exploited by secessionists and terror sympathizers, leading to more violence and counter-violence|

**Reforms Needed in AFSPA**

|   |
|---|
|**Proposed Measures**|
|**Ensure compliance with human rights** while maintaining operational effectiveness|
|**Ensure provisions for robust safeguards** within the parameters of the law|
|**Thorough inquiry** for every death caused by armed forces|
|**No absolute immunity** for Army personnel who commits a crime|
||
|**Clearly define terms like “disturbed”, “dangerous”, and “land forces”** to ensure greater clarity|
|**Set up committees at the district level** with representatives of the army, administrators, and the public to report, assess and track complaints in that area|
|**Justice Jeevan Reddy Committee Recommendations:**  Repeal AFSPA and insert appropriate provisions in the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967|
|**2nd ARC**: It recommended the repeal of AFSPA|

**Conclusion:**

With the improvement in the situation in the Northeast, AFSPA should be gradually removed. To reduce the possibility of its misuse, AFSPA should be made more comprehensive, with elaborate rules concerning the method of investigations of alleged human rights violations

**Best practice – CoWIN app – Example of democratising digital technology:**

- **The entire process** of onboarding vaccine manufacturers, clinics, hospitals, registration of citizens and scheduling, till the final certificate of vaccination, is digital.
- This enabled India to **administer 150 crore doses** within the first 12 months of the vaccination drive.

**What makes 2023 an inflexion point?**

- **AI, 5G, and quantum technology** have matured to a level where they are becoming mainstream.
- India has assumed the **leadership of the G20.**
- **Atmanirbhar Bharat**.

**A new initiative – OCEN (open credit enablement network):**

- The government is developing the OCEN, which will lead to **competition among various banks for giving loans to a person** → lower the cost of credit → propel the **credit-to-GDP ratio** from the current **57 to 100% by 2031**.

**Way ahead:** This game-changing digital and tech-led revolution, which gives power to the poorest and marginalised sections is to be **replicated across different sectors**.

### **An Affinity tests**

 **Source:** [**Th**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/affinity-test-cannot-be-the-litmus-test-to-decide-a-caste-claim-sc/article66667015.ece#:~:text=Sushil%20Kumar%20Verma-,An%20affinity%20test%20cannot%20be%20the%20litmus%20test%20to%20decide,tribe%20claim%20in%20every%20case.)

 **Context:** The Supreme Court of India has ruled that an “affinity test,” which measures an applicant’s knowledge of a particular tribe or caste’s customs, rituals, and other traits, cannot be the sole determinant of a caste or tribe claim.

 **What is an affinity test?**

 An affinity test is a study on caste/tribe claims based on the **peculiar anthropological and ethnological traits, deities, rituals, customs, mode of marriage**, death ceremonies, methods of burial of dead bodies, etc., of a particular caste or tribe, as well as the applicant’s knowledge of them.

- It is used as a means to **corroborate the documentary evidence submitted** by the applicant in support of their caste or tribe claim.

**Why affinity test can’t be the sole criterion?**

**An applicant’s knowledge of SC/ST traits may not be an accurate measure** of his or her belonging to a particular caste or tribe, as **he or she may have learned these traits from other sources**.

- Also,  if the applicant has stayed in urban areas outside his community for decades, the applicant may not know the facts
- The court recognized that the **test can be helpful**, but it cannot be conclusive proof of caste or tribe status.

**Significance of the ruling:** The court’s ruling resolves conflicting views on the use of affinity tests to determine caste or tribe status.

### **Berry borer infestation**

 **Source:** [**Th**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/agriculture/berry-borer-infestation-coffee-board-issues-advisory-to-farmers/article66619316.ece)

 **Context:** The Coffee Board has issued an advisory to coffee farmers to tackle the attack of berry borer in Robusta coffee plants.

**What is Berry borer infestation?**

**Berry borer infestation is a common problem** in coffee production. It is caused by a small beetle called the coffee berry borer, which lays its eggs inside coffee berries.

**Measures to control it:**

- **The berry borer-infested gleanings, leftover fruits, and off-season berries** should be collected and disposed of by burning or burying them in the soil or disinfested by dipping them in boiling water to mitigate the attack in the next season
- **Brocca traps,** an effective measure to control the berry borer population in coffee plantations, should be installed and backing irrigation should be provided for Robusta coffee plants.

### **‘Pellet-beam’ propulsion**

 **Source:** [**Sciencealtert**](https://www.sciencealert.com/radical-nasa-propulsion-concept-could-reach-interstellar-space-in-under-5-years#:~:text=Radical%20NASA%20Propulsion%20Concept%20Could%20Reach%20Interstellar%20Space%20in%20Under%205%20Years,-Space24%20March&text=A%20newly%20proposed%20propulsion%20system,probe%2035%20years%20to%20achieve.)

 **Context:** A new propulsion system concept called **‘pellet-beam’ propulsion** has been proposed that could potentially **beam a heavy spacecraft outside of our Solar System in less than 5 years.**

**What is a propulsion system?**

A propulsion system is a machine that produces thrust to push an object forward. E.g., the burning of chemical fuel gives thrust for rocket engines to go into orbit

**Working of ‘Pellet-beam’ propulsion?**

It involves beaming tiny microscopic pellets at a spacecraft to propel it through space, instead of using traditional chemical-fuelled rockets. The propulsion system requires two spacecraft:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Spacecraft 1**|**Spacecraft 2**|
|**Goes into orbit around Earth**|**Sets off for interstellar space**|
|It will **shoot a beam of tiny microscopic particles** at the interstellar spacecraft, which would be **heated up by lasers**, causing part of them to melt into plasma that accelerates the pellets further, a process known **as laser ablation**|The heated pellets could reach 120 km/second and either **hit the sail of the interstellar spacecraft or repel a magnet within it**, helping to **propel** the spacecraft to huge speeds|

**The pellet-beam concept was partly inspired** by the **Breakthrough Starshot initiative**, which is working on a ‘light-sail’ propulsion system.

NASA is developing **bimodal nuclear propulsion** – a two-part system consisting of Nuclear Thermal and Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NTP and NEP element; therefore ‘bimodal’) – that could enable transits to **Mars in just 45 days**

### **Plastiglomerate**

**Source: TH**

**Context:** A team of marine biologists (working in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands) have stumbled upon a piece of rock (Plastiglomerate) made from plastic from a beach on Aves Island.

- This is the first such find from India.

**What is plastiglomerate?**

It is a rock composed of sand, rock fragments, shells and other materials held together by plastic. It is a new form of [**plastic pollution**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/environment-pollution-and-control/waste-management/plastic-waste/), which scientists described in 2014.

- Laboratory analysis showed that it was made of two very commonly used plastic polymers, **polyethene and polyvinyl chloride**

**About Aves Island:**

Aves Island is an island of the Andaman Islands. It belongs to the North and Middle Andaman administrative district, part of the Indian union territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The island lies **140 km north of Port Blair**
