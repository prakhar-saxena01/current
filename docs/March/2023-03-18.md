### [India’s poor performance on specific international indicators due to methodological issues: EAC-PM](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/18/indias-poor-performance-on-specific-international-indicators-due-to-methodological-issues-eac-pm/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Issues relating to Poverty and Hunger**

**Source:** [**ET**](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/global-data-mismatch-due-to-methodological-issues-notes-eac-pm-paper/articleshow/98710175.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=cppst)

**Context:** According to the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM), India’s poor performance on specific international indicators **despite rising per capita income** is due to methodological issues.

**Socio-development indicators where systematic biases exist:**

- [Childhood Stunting](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/17/acute-malnutrition-risking-30-million-childrens-lives-who/),
- [Female Labour Force Participation Rate](https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/issues-related-to-women/women-in-workforce/) and
- Life Expectancy

**The impact of methodological issues:**

- **Conceptual ambiguity**, flawed benchmarks and shoddy methodology → flawed estimation → overestimating the level of deprivation.
- The growing use of Environment Social and Governance (ESG) norms in investment and trade decisions will mean that **real-world decision-making** will be increasingly impacted by biased data.

**What aggravates the problem?**

- The Indian statistical authorities do not publish accurate data on a regular basis.
- **For example**, the registrar general of India (RGI) publishes life expectancy estimates every year. However, the official estimates for 2019 were released in July 2022 by RGI.

**Case study:**

- **The global hunger index (GHI)** of FAO captures three dimensions of hunger: insufficient availability of food, shortfalls in the nutritional status of children and child mortality (which is mainly attributable to undernutrition).
- The 2022 index has ranked India at **107 among 121 countries.**
- According to the Indian government, the index is **an erroneous measure of hunger and suffers from serious methodological issues.**
- Three out of the four indicators used for the calculation of the index are related to the h**ealth of Children and cannot be representative of the entire population**.
- The fourth and most important indicator estimate of the Proportion of the Undernourished (PoU) population is **based on an opinion poll** conducted on a very small sample size of 3000.

**Recommendations:**

- To counter the global mismatches, **Indian statistical authorities** must publish their own estimates proactively.
- In order to be on time, t**his can be done based even on partial data**, which can be updated later. This is done in the case of **GDP**.

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: International Relations**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/iran-saudi-deal-what-the-gambit-can-mean-for-china-west-asia-and-india-8502096/)

 **Context:** The Saudi-Iran detente/truce is China’s major geopolitical manoeuvre in West Asia and sets the stage for political influence in the region that was formerly dominated by the US.

**Background:**

- **The opening of diplomatic relations between the two** came after decades of enmity and a formal cutting of ties in 2016.
- Since 2014, the two countries had been in **a proxy war in Yemen**, where Iran is backing the Houthi rebels and the Saudis lead a coalition of Gulf states backed by the US.

**About the Saudi-Iran deal brokered by China:** The “**joint trilateral statement**”, signed in Beijing, includes –

- **Resumption of diplomatic relations** and reopening of embassies and missions;
- To respect for the sovereignty of states and the non-interference in the internal affairs of states;
- **To implement the Security Cooperation Agreement (2001)** and
- To implement the General Agreement for Cooperation in **Economy, Trade, Investment, Technology, Science, Culture, Sports, and Yout**h (1998).

**Mutual Interests Drive Settlement Decision: Exploring Reasons Behind Agreement**

- **For Saudi,** tense relations with the Biden Administration, t**he absence of American security guarantees against Iran**, rapid changes in the Saudi economy (diversification) and China’s rising profile in West Asia.
- **For Iran**, the isolation that came with the nuclear sanctions; **the Abrahamic accords** (2020) – the coming together of archenemy Israel-UAE-Bahrain-Saudi; the uprising of women; normalised relations with UAE and Kuwait.

**Significance of the deal:**

- No one believes this deal will end all differences between the Sunni (Saudi) monarchy and Shia (Iran) republic.
- The deal may lead **to lasting peace in Yemen** and also end proxy Saudi-Iran hostilities in **Lebanon, Syria**, etc.
- May develop into a **four-way alignment (Saudi-Iran-China-Russia).**
- **China is taking a new avatar** – peacemaker, power broker – giving the world a new alternative to the US (blamed for instability in the region – failed miserably in Iraq, and Afghanistan).

**World’s response**

- **US:** Welcomed the agreement and declined the assessment of diminished US influence in the region. **For example,** Saudi recently concluded a deal for 121 Boeing aircraft with the US.
- **Israel**: A clear setback for PM Binyamin Netanyahu’s foreign policy – claiming to be the only country that could bring together an Arab-Israeli coalition against Iran.
    - **The** [Abrahamic Accords](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/08/15/israel-uae-agreement/)/the Arab-Israeli alliance, mediated by the Trump Administration, are **shaken up by the Saudi-Iran agreement.**
- **India: Shocked** by China’s (its principal adversary in a region where it has invested much diplomatic energy over the last decade) new avatar.
    - India has always advocated dialogue and diplomacy to resolve differences.

**Options available for India:**

- **Cooperation** rather than confrontation with China in West Asia.
- Considering **both countries have a wide range of shared interests** in terms of energy security, open and free sea lanes, logistical connectivity, and most importantly, regional stability.

**Conclusion:**

- China’s big-ticket diplomacy in the region is sure to impact the [I2U2 (Israel-India-UAE-US](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/09/06/sansad-tv-diplomatic-dispatch-i2u2-summit/)) grouping.
- It calls for India **to work on its ties to the region independently of the US** (for instance with Iran), and in ways that project its civilisational and cultural links and the positive contributions of the Indian diaspora.

### [Will the national champions model of infrastructure development work?](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/18/will-the-national-champions-model-of-infrastructure-development-work/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus: Infrastructure: Energy, Ports, Roads, Airports, Railways etc./Investment models**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/will-the-national-champions-model-of-infrastructure-development-work-8502004/)

**Context:** Infrastructure in emerging economies like India has seemingly become both **a demonstration of good and a necessity.**

**Importance of Infrastructure in emerging economies:**

- Simultaneously works as a national aspiration good,
- A barometer of national progress,
- A mechanism for job creation,
- A vehicle for crowding in private investment, etc.

**Constraints on infrastructure provision are:**

- **Expensive**, because it needs to be built to a minimum scale.
- **Often has a public good component,** which makes the social value of infrastructure higher than its private value to individual users → **making it relatively unprofitable for private investors**.
- **The traditional approach to financing infrastructure** → tax revenues or government borrowing.
- **Vicious trap** → poorer economies generate less tax revenue → increasing public borrowing domestically → crowd out private investment → limits infrastructure investment, growth of the economy → keep the country poor.

**Indian government’s efforts to come out of this vicious trap?**

- **Incentivise private sector participation** by providing targeted subsidies for infrastructure investments.
    - In the early 2000s, the **Public-Private-Partnership (PPP)** model was introduced.
    - While the program **did result in the construction of a lot of infrastructure**, it ended in an avalanche of non-performing assets with public sector banks → widespread corruption → change in government in 2014.
- **The “national champions” model:** It modified the [PPP approach](https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-economy-3/investment-models/various-investment-models/public-private-partnership-model/) by assigning the bulk of the infrastructure provisioning for roads, ports, airports, energy, and communications to a few chosen industrial houses.

**How does this model overcome the difficulty of financing infrastructure?**

- **Incentivising national champions** to build the projects identified by the government.
- **New aspects of the national champions model**:
    - Champions given control over existing projects with strong cash flows → helps them to achieve **targeted returns and borrow** from external credit markets → lowers the cost of finance, freeing up domestic savings for private investment
    - The public association of the champions with the government’s national development policy → **generates a competitive advantage** in getting domestic and foreign contracts.

**Issues with the national champions model:**

- The **direct association of conglomerates with government policies** → markets, regulators treat them as too big to fail → **delayed discovery of problems**, spillovers.
- The longer it takes for projects to generate large cash flows, the greater will be the need for the state to provide **access to additional cash flows**.
- This risks turning the country into an **industrial oligarchy**.
- **An uneven playing field** in terms of market access, regulatory relaxations → a significant deterrent for foreign investors → bad for **efficiency and productivity at the economy-wide level**

**Dilemma India is facing:**

- Can infrastructure provision be the solution to India’s growth aspirations?
- India is at an inflection point in its development path.

**Way ahead:** A development model based on a domestic **demand-driven production structure, powered by soft and hard infrastructure.**

 **Context:** A recent book has highlighted how climate and geography influenced early civilizations

[**Indus Valley Civilisation**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/ancient-indian-history/harappan-indus-valley-civilization/) differs from other ancient civilizations because inequality levels were far lower than in other civilizations.

- **Reason**: This was because the Indus, unlike the other rivers, changed its course often. This changed the structure of the society of the Indus Valley Civilization.

- The recent Shiv Sena crisis in Maharashtra, where the Governor was criticized for using his powers to order a floor test, **brought back attention to this landmark ruling**.

**About Rameshwar Prasad v Union of India:**

- In **2005, Bihar saw a hung Legislative Assembly** with no party or alliance able to reach a majority, leading to the **Governor recommending** [President’s Rule under Article 365](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/indian-constitution/significant-provisions/emergency-provisions/presidents-rule/).
- Later, the Governor recommended the dissolution of the Assembly, and **fresh elections were announced by the** [Election Commission of India](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/appointment-to-various-constitutional-posts-powers-functions-and-responsibilities-of-various-constitutional-bodies/election-commission/), leading to petitions challenging the constitutionality of the dissolution of the Assembly.
- The Supreme Court **struck down the President’s Proclamation** dissolving the state Assembly as unconstitutional, and though it did not restore the Assembly**, it defined the contours of the Governor’s powers to dissolve the Assembly.**

**Context**: The **International Criminal Court** issued an **arrest warrant for war crimes for President Vladimir Putin and a second Russian official.**

**Why did the International Criminal Court issued the warrants?**

- The court says **Putin bears individual criminal responsibility for the abduction and deportation of Ukrainian children** since Russia’s full-scale invasion.
- The court also **issued a warrant for Maria Lvova-Belova**, Russia’s commissioner for children’s rights, who has **been the public face of a Kremlin-sponsored program in which Ukrainian children and teenagers have been taken to Russia.**

**About International Criminal Court:**

- The [International Criminal Court](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/09/28/international-criminal-court-3/) was created as a standing body to **investigate war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity under a 1998** treaty known as **the Rome Statute**.
- Previously, the United Nations Security Council had **established ad hoc tribunals to address atrocities in places such as the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.**

**Context**: For the first time in the world the **Chennai-based National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT)** is working at making **Low-Temperature Thermal Desalination (LTTD) technology** process free of emissions.

- An initiative of providing **potable water in six islands of Lakshadweep.**

**Current Situation:**

- Currently, the desalination plants, each of which provides at least **100,000 litres of potable water every day, are powered by diesel generator sets.**

**How LTTD works:**

- LTTD **exploits the difference in temperature (nearly 15°C) in the ocean water at the surface and at depths of about 600 feet**.
- This cold water **condenses water at the surface, which is warmer but whose pressure has been lowered using vacuum pump**
- Such de-pressurised water can evaporate even at ambient temperatures and this resulting **vapour when condensed is free of salts and contaminants and fit to consume.**

**National Institute of Ocean Technology:**

- The NIOT, an institute under the **aegis of the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES),** has worked for years on **harnessing energy from the ocean.**

- India currently **imports these robots from the US and Switzerland**.

**About these robots:**

- Quadruped robots are **four-legged robots** which can walk or **run on uneven and rough terrains.**
- **Active exoskeletons**, when worn by soldiers, can **carry such heavy loads** without expending much effort. Even if they are carrying 25 kg, soldiers feel as if they are carrying six or seven kg, thus **they are not fatigued easily.**

Both are dual-use robots and **have multiple use cases in industry and healthcare as well.**
