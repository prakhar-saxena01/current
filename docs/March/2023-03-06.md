#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus****: Polity –** Appointment to various **Constitutional posts, powers, functions and responsibilities** of various Constitutional Bodies.

**Source:** [Indian Express](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/bjp-mla-son-bribery-scandal-history-powers-of-the-karnataka-lokayukta-8479567/)

**Context: T**he [Lokayukta](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/08/25/lokayukta/) **has seized over Rs 8 crore of unaccounted cash** from the residence and office of a BJP MLA, who was serving as the **chairperson of the Public Sector Undertaking (PSU) Karnataka Soaps and Detergents Ltd (KS&DL).**

- A bribery case filed under Section **7 (a) (b) (public servant taking gratification other than legal remuneration in respect of an official act) of the** [Prevention of Corruption Act.](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2018/11/27/prevention-of-corruption-act/)

|**About Lokayukta**|Lokayukta is an **anti-corruption authority or ombudsman** appointed by the state government to **investigate complaints of corruption and maladministration** against public servants and elected representatives.|
|**Through Act – Statutory body**|Lokayuktas are the state equivalents of the central Lokpal, as per the provisions of [the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013.](https://www.insightsonindia.com/governance/governance-important-aspects/transparency/lokpal/)|

**Section 63 of the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013** mandates that every state shall establish a body known as Lokayukta **Composition** The Lokpal should consist of a maximum of **eight members, of which:**

·         **50% shall be judicial members, and**

·         **at least 50% should belong to the SCs, STs, OBCs, minorities, or women.** **Powers:** The Lokayukta can:

·         Investigate complaints against **public servants, ministers, and elected representatives at the state level.**

·         **Recommend disciplinary action, including removal from office or prosecution, against a public servant, found guilty of corruption or maladministration.**

·         Recommend changes to **policies and procedures to prevent corruption and maladministration.**

**A timeline of the “Lokayukta” in Karnataka**

- **The Karnataka Lokayukta Act, 1984** came into force on January 15, 1986, and was passed with the objective of **improving the standards of public administration**, by looking into complaints against **administrative actions, including cases of corruption, favouritism and official indiscipline in the administrative machinery.**
- In 2016, **an Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB)** was created which issued subsequent notifications transferring the **power to probe corruption cases under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, from Karnataka Lokayukta police to the ACB.**
- However, in 2022, a **division bench of the Karnataka High Court** in “**Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State of Karnataka”** ordered the **abolishing of ACB and the revival of an anti-corruption police unit** attached to the Karnataka Lokayukta, a **quasi-judicial institution that works independent of the state**. Since then, the Karnataka Lokayukta’s powers have been restored.

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus: Bilateral, Regional and Global Groupings and Agreements involving India and/or affecting India’s interests**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/g20-meet-shows-a-deepening-crisis-in-multilateralism-8478242/)

 **Context:** The **G-20 Foreign Ministers’ meeting** in Delhi was unable to agree to a joint communique, over [differences between Russia and the West on the war in Ukraine](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/11/editorial-analysis-lessons-from-russias-ukraine-war/).

**Issues that needed to be addressed  at the recent meeting:**

- **The war in Ukraine:** The G20 members accept that security issues can have a **big impact on the world economy** but that the G20 is **not the platform to address such issues.**
    - **The UNSC and UNGA resolution condemn Russia’s** actions against Ukraine and call for its unconditional and total withdrawal from Ukrainian territory.
- **Upholding international law that safeguards peace and stability**: This includes defending the Principles enshrined in the Charter of the UN and adhering to international humanitarian law.

**The principal reason for the diplomatic failure in Delhi:**

- The decision by Russia to **walk away from the** [**Bali consensus**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/11/17/as-india-takes-g20-presidency-key-takeaways-from-the-summit-in-bali/) (calling it a “thing of the past”) and China’s decision to support it.
- Russia also feels that the meetings are about the **economy, growth, development and other global challenges**.

**Implications:** Underlines the **deepening great power conflict** and **worsening crisis of multilateralism**.

**Other agreements at the meeting:** A number of issues of interest to India and the developing world include –

- Food and energy security,
- Cooperation to counter-terrorism, climate change, global health and disaster management.

**India’s twin ambitions as G20 President:**

- To continue the **campaign to reform multilateralism** and
- To get the world to take **greater cognisance of the challenges** faced by the “**Global South**”.

**Way ahead for India as G20 President:**

- It is clear that **India cannot rely on the language of the Bali Summit.**
- The Sherpas will need to **craft fresh language on Ukraine** – an innovative formula that considers Russian concerns as well as the western desire to condemn Russia’s conduct.
- **India can leverage Quadrilateral Security Dialogue** (Quad), whose foreign ministers are going to meet soon after the G20 foreign ministers’ meeting.

**Conclusion:** As host, **India is in the ‘hot seat’** balancing the G7 camp on one side and the Russia-China combine on the other, to ensure that a middle path is found.

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Conservation, environmental pollution and degradation, environmental impact assessment**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/unused-funds-unsuitable-land-act-as-red-light-before-green-shoots-8479659/)

 **Context:** [Compensatory afforestation](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/12/07/campa-funds/#:~:text=Compensatory%20afforestation%20means%20that%20every,area%20of%20degraded%20forest%20land.) forms a significant component of various reforestation programmes being implemented in India.

**Background:**

- India has promised to **increase its forest and tree** cover to absorb an additional 2.5 – 3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent by 2030.
- However, **the forestry target is difficult to achieve** due to the need for rapid industrial, infrastructure development, and urbanisation.
- In the last 10 years, **more than 1,611 square km** of forest land (a third of this in the last three years) has been cleared.
- But government data shows that **total forest cover had increased by 1,540 square km** in the two years between 2019 and 2021.

**Programmes with compensatory afforestation component:**

- [Green India Mission](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/02/03/green-india-mission-2/),
- **National afforestation programme**
- Tree plantation exercises along the highways and railways
- National rural employment guarantee scheme (MGNREGS)
- Namami Gange, etc

**What is Compensatory Afforestation?**

- **The compensatory afforestation programme** ensures that forest lands getting ‘diverted’ for non-forest purposes is **mandatorily accompanied by afforestation** on an equal area of land.
- It was made a legal requirement through the **Compensatory Afforestation Fund (CAF) Act 2016.**
- Though the law came in 2016, the concept has existed since the 1980s, as an offshoot of the [Forest Conservation Act 1980](https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/environment-degradation-and-issues/forest-ecosystem/forest-policy-and-laws-for-forest-conservation/the-forest-conservation-act-1980/#:~:text=Enacted%20to%20check%20the%20indiscriminate,prescribing%20the%20punishment%20for%20violations.&text=Working%20plans%20should%20be%20up,have%20a%20multi%2Ddimensional%20approach.).

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pushed.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pushed.png)**

**Salient provisions of the CAF Act 2016:**

- Newer parcels of land are earmarked for development as forests.
- Project developers (public/private) are **required to fund the entire afforestation activity** on these new lands.
- Project developers are also asked to pay for the [Net Present Value (NPV)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/09/12/net-present-value-npv/) **of the forests** being cleared, as the new lands cannot be compared with the fully grown forests getting diverted.
- According to recent calculations, companies have to pay NPV **between Rs 9.5 lakh and Rs 16 lakh per hectare**, depending on the quality of forests getting diverted.
- All this money is meant for **increasing/improving the quality of forest cover** in the country.

**How money is disbursed for compensatory afforestation?**

- The money is parked in **special funds** created for this purpose at the Central and state levels.
- The money is **first deposited in the Central fund**, from where it gets disbursed to states where the projects are located.
- State governments prepare **an annual plan of operations** → approved by the Compensatory Afforestation Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) at the Central level → the state government transfers funds to the state forest departments → carry out the work.
- The Central fund **can keep up to 10% of the total money** for administrative expenses.

**Issues faced by the compensatory afforestation:**

- **Legitimised clearing of forests** and see it as an example of **‘**[greenwashing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/greenwashing.asp)**’**.
- Money collected before 2016 had **remained largely unutilised.** **For example,** much of the Rs 55,000 crore in the state funds remains locked.
- Allegations of **misutilisation** or diversion of these funds.
- **Lack of availability of suitable land/**unavailability of land in a **contiguous stretch** remains the biggest problem.
- Land made available for afforestation cannot be used for any other purpose and is **unsuitable for growing plantations.**
- Often the plantations are **monocultures**, which is against the core concept of [biodiversity](https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/biodiversity/).
- **Biotic pressures** – plantations face nearby human habitations and cattle.

**Conclusion:** As the clearing of forests cannot be entirely eliminated, compensatory afforestation is a good mechanism to make up for these losses to some extent. However, the above issues need to be addressed.

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Conservation, environmental pollution and degradation, environmental impact assessment**

**Source:** [**BBC**](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-64839763)

 **Context:** After more than a decade of negotiations, the UN members have agreed (in New York, US) on the first-ever treaty – **the UN High Seas Treaty,** **to protect the world’s oceans outside national boundaries**.

**What are the high seas?**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/territorial.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/territorial.png)

- **2/3rd of the world’s oceans** are currently considered international waters/high seas.
- But until now **only about 1%** of these waters have been protected.
- According to **the IUCN**,
    - Nearly 10% of marine species on the high seas **were found to be at risk of extinction mainly due to overfishing and pollution**.
    - 41% of the threatened species are also affected by **climate change** (more CO2 absorption, more acidic, increased marine heat waves), and deep sea **mining**.
- For example, **Dugongs** used to be common marine animals but now less than 1000 remain in the wild.
- Therefore, the issue of climate change in the sea involves implementing other global agreements such as the [Paris Agreement](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/07/08/financial-and-technological-commitments-under-unfccc-and-paris-agreement/).

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/global_species.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/global_species.png)**

**What is in the High Seas Treaty?**

- It places **30%** of the world’s international waters into **protected areas (MPAs) by 2030**, and puts more money into marine conservation and new rules for mining at sea.
- It also provides for **–**
    - **Arrangements for sharing marine genetic resources**, such as biological material from plants and animals in the ocean.
    - Requirements for **environmental assessments** for deep sea activities like mining.
- Richer nations have pledged money for the delivery of the treaty. **For example**, the EU announced nearly 820m euros (£722.3m).
- The treaty can have **benefits for society (pharmaceuticals and food)** and will help **reverse biodiversity losses and ensure sustainable development**.

**Concerns:**

- There were debates, particularly around **what a marine protected area is** – sustainable use/fully protected from fishing, shipping and exploration activities like deep-sea mining.
- Developing nations were **disappointed by the limited funding options included** in the text of the treaty.
- **If the MPAs are not properly connected**, it might not have the desired impact as many species are migratory.

**Way ahead: The treaty must be formally adopted** and will enter “into force” once enough countries (~ 40) have signed and legally passed it in their own countries.

- **The report measures** laws that affect women’s economic opportunity
- **Indicators considered by the report for ranking**: Mobility, Workplace, Pay, Marriage, Parenthood, Entrepreneurship etc.

**Issues faced by working women (as per the Report):**

 **Global:**

- Women enjoy only **77% of** the legal rights that men do
- At the current pace, it would take at least 50 years to approach legal gender equality everywhere

**India:**

- Laws affecting pay, pension, inheritance and property rights
- Laws affecting women’s work after having children
- Constraints on women starting and running a business

 **Suggestions by the report:**

- India consider reforms to improve legal equality for women
- India should consider mandating equal remuneration for work of equal value
- Allowing women to work at night in the same way as men (Several State Governments including Karnataka, UP has allowed factories to employ women on night shifts)
- Allowing women to work in industrial jobs in the same way as men

### **Hallmark Unique Identification Number (HUID)**

**Source:** [PIB](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1904262)

**Context: Bureau of India Standards (BIS**) has **prohibited the sale of hallmarked gold jewellery or gold artefacts without a 6-digit alphanumeric Hallmark Unique Identification Number (HUID)** after 31st March 2023.

- HUID in accordance with the **Indian Standards specified in IS 1417: 2016 as**
- **Hallmarked jewellery** **lying with consumers as per old schemes shall remain valid.**

**About Hallmarking:**

- Hallmarking scheme was started **by BIS in the year 2000**.
- Mandatory Hallmarking has been successfully implemented **with effect from 23 June 2021 vide Hallmarking of Gold Jewellery and Gold Artefacts Order, 2022, and its amendment dated 04 March 2022**.
- Before the **implementation of 6 digit Hallmark Unique Identification (HUID) number,** hallmarking of Gold jewellery consisted of **4 logos viz, the BIS logo, purity of the article as well as logo of the jeweller and Assaying and Hallmarking Centre.**
- After the introduction of HUID, the hallmark consists **of 3 marks viz, BIS logo, purity of the article and six-digit alphanumeric HUID**.
- A consumer can check and authenticate hallmarked gold jewellery items with a HUID number using ‘**verify HUID’ in BIS CARE app**which is available on both Android as well as iOS.

**Why Hallmarking:**

- Maintain the quality of gold in the market.
- Consumer protection.

**Issues with Apple farming:**

- **High cost of production**: Due to rising input costs and high taxation
- **No legally guaranteed procurement** at an [MSP](https://www.insightsonindia.com/agriculture/farm-subsidies-and-msp/minimum-support-prices/) (only J&K has MSP on apple)
- **Higher imports of apples:** It creates a glut in the domestic market and lowers the profit for farmers.

### **Chip redesign to optimize server ops, water to keep cool**

 **Source:** [Indian Express](https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/chip-redesign-to-optimise-server-ops-water-to-keep-cool-8479748/)

**Context:** Data centres and the Cloud are major energy consumers, **with most of the energy consumed in keeping the servers cool, rather than processing data.**

**New design:**

- A new server architecture is being developed at the **Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne experiments with what is called a “multi-core architecture template with an integrated on-chip microfluidic fuel cell network**” to draw heat out of a stacked chip and cool it faster without overheating.
- This technology aims to **improve server efficiency and drastically improve energy efficiency, reducing carbon footprint.**

Other technology solutions being tried globally include **Subsea Cloud’s proposal to put commercial data centres in deep ocean waters,** and **Microsoft’s plan to build a tube with closed ends, placing servers inside and dropping the tube down to the ocean floor.**

### **Bio-computers**

**Context**: Scientists at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) recently outlined a potentially revolutionary new area of research called “[organoid](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/10/28/organoids/) **intelligence**”, which aims to create **“biocomputers”: where brain cultures grown in the lab are coupled to real-world sensors and input/output devices.**

**About Bio computers:**

- Bio computers are **computing devices that use biological components** such as DNA, proteins, and cells to perform computational tasks. Biocomputers use the **properties of biological systems to perform computations, such as molecular recognition, self-assembly, and amplification.**
- Researchers coupled the organoids with machine learning by growing the organoids **inside flexible structures affixed with multiple electrodes (similar to the ones used to take EEG readings from the brain).**
- These structures will be able to **record the firing patterns of the neurons and also deliver electrical stimuli, to mimic sensory stimuli.** The response pattern of the neurons and their effect on human behaviour or biology will then be **analyzed by machine-learning techniques.**
- Recently, scientists **were able to grow human neurons on top of a microelectrode array** that could both record and stimulate these neurons.

**Opportunities for ‘bio-computers’**

- They could also **help decode the pathology of drug development** for devastating **neurodevelopmental and degenerative diseases** such as Parkinson’s disease and microcephaly.
- Their ability to perform **massively parallel computations, operate at the molecular level and potentially be more energy-efficient.**

**Aim of the** [**CITES**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/01/08/cites-washington-convention/): It is aimed at ensuring that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten the survival of the species.

- It accords varying degrees of **protection to over 37,000 species of animals and plants**, listed in three Appendices, depending on their level of threat (see infographic).
- It is further expanded into the **conservation of marine life and oceans,** and on collaborating with businesses and funding conservation activities.

**Permit System:** All import, export and re-export of species covered under CITES must be authorised through a permit system.

**COP**: Every two years, the Conference of the Parties (CoP), the **supreme decision-making body of CITES,** applies a set of biological and trade criteria to evaluate proposals from parties to decide if a species should be in Appendix I or II.

- Recently, in November 2022, **CoP19 (also known as the World Wildlife Conference)** was held in Panama City.
