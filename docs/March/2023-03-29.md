#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: Governance**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/2-years-after-finance-panel-suggested-centre-evaluating-26-proposals-for-new-cities-8522519/)

 **Context:**  The Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry is currently **evaluating 26 proposals from 21 states** for the creation of new cities in India.

**Recommendations for new cities:**

**15th Finance Commission** recommended **Rs 8,000 crore for the incubation of eight new cities**  (Rs 1000 cr to each) in the country through a challenge.

**Criteria:**

- A state can have **only one new city** through this fund.
- **A maximum of nine new cities** in nine states can be selected

**The proposal received** for new cities or expansion of existing ones are Gurgaon (Haryana), Jabalpur Extension (Madhya Pradesh), Ayodhya (Uttar Pradesh), GIFT City Expansion (Gujarat), Nagaki Global City (Nagaland), New MOPA Ayush City (Goa), and Bantala Greenfield City (West Bengal)

**Need for New cities:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Need for new cities**|**Supporting data**|
|**Rapid urbanization**|According to the United Nations, **68% of the world population is projected to live in urban areas by 2050**. This trend is driven by factors such as population growth, migration, and increasing economic opportunities in cities.<br><br>The share of the urban population in **India is over 35% (2021)**|
|**Congestion and pollution in existing cities**|This can have **negative impacts on health, quality of life**, and the environment.|
|**Housing shortages**|Nearly **2 million people in India** are homeless|
|**Economic development**|For example, the creation of the **Shenzhen Special Economic Zone in China** in 1980 has been credited with spurring economic growth and development in the region.|
|**Disaster resilience**|For example, after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, the government began planning a new city called “**Smart City Kashiwa-no-ha”** that is designed to be resilient to earthquakes and other disasters.|

**New cities developed in India since Independence**: Chandigarh, Gandhinagar, Navi Mumbai, Bhubaneswar, Naya Raipur, Amravati (Andhra Pradesh), Dholera, Gift City, Kochi Smart City, GIFT City Gujarat, Auroville (Puducherry)

**Government programmes for City development:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Programme Name**|**Description**|
|**Smart Cities Mission (2015)**|It aims to develop 100 smart cities across India by providing them with advanced and modern infrastructure.|
|**AMRUT (2015)**|It aims to provide basic amenities like water supply, sewerage, and urban transport to improve the quality of life of citizens. It focuses on **500 cities and towns with a population of over 100,000.**|

### [Healthcare in India has made great progress, but challenges remain](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/29/healthcare-in-india-has-made-great-progress-but-challenges-remain/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Issues Relating to Development and Management of Social Sector/Services relating to Health**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/healthcare-in-india-has-made-great-progress-but-challenges-remain-8524485/)

**Context:** India will continue to have the world’s youngest population for more than three decades, but to fully capitalise on this advantage there is the need to overcome certain difficult health issues.

**Some recent achievements in the health sector:**

- **NFHS-5:**
    - **Total fertility rate (TFR):** India achieved a TFR of 2.1 (replacement level) in 2020.
    - **Maternal and infant mortality:** Even in the BIMARU states, hospital deliveries have soared to 89%.
- **Increase in insurance coverage:** 74% of Indians are either covered or eligible for health insurance coverage.
    - **Ayushman Bharat insurance scheme** (2018) provides insurance against hospitalisation for up to Rs 5 lakh per year per family.

**Challenges affecting everyone in the population:**

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/indias.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/indias.png)**

**Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), cancers, diabetes:**

- Rising due to **behavioural risk factors** – an unhealthy diet, lack of physical activity and use of tobacco and alcohol.
- As a result, the proportion of deaths due to **non-communicable diseases (NCDs)** has increased from around 38 – 62% in 2016.

**The state of infrastructure**:

- **Huge variations between states:** Jharkhand, Karnataka and UP had the lowest number of primary healthcare institutions operating at full institutional capacity.
    - **People have to bank on the private sector,** which owns two-thirds of the country’s hospital beds.

**Gaps in services available in the metros and districts:** 95% of private hospital beds are provided by district hospitals and nursing homes, yet **they are unable to offer multispecialty care** including tertiary and quaternary care.

**Low health insurance penetration:**

- Out-patient doctor consultation costs, diagnostics and drugs account for the biggest chunk (**50%)** of **out-of-pocket** (OOP) **personal expenditures**.
- It is **essential to provide insurance** for the unorganised middle class to include identified out-patient costs.

**Ethical and regulatory concerns around the use of AI and digital technology:**

- Surgery assisted by robots, the use of genetic codes, and clinical judgements based on AI are already widespread.
- However, **medical malpractice in substandard institutions** and by unqualified medical practitioners is still not regulated.

**Way ahead:**

- **Building awareness** about the benefits of leading a healthy life will save millions from illness and decelerate premature death.
- **More cost-effective treatment** → bolster primary healthcare by establishing **health and wellness centres.**
- Making the **centrally-run hospitals** and the district hospitals fully functional.
- **Bridging gaps in hospital services** between large urban agglomerations and tier II and tier III cities.
- Ethical and regulatory concerns prompted the ICMR to **release guidelines foreseeing the problems of a lack of accountability** for machine-made medical decisions.

**Conclusion:**

India has shown how the impossible can be achieved. What is needed is **out-of-the-box thinking** and the resolve to steer the ship before a storm arrives.

### [Green hydrogen is not a holy grail of the energy transition](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/29/green-hydrogen-is-not-a-holy-grail-of-the-energy-transition/)

**GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus:** **Infrastructure/Environment**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/world/fossil-fuel-lobby-behind-eu-s-dash-for-not-so-green-hydrogen-report-88511)

 **Context:** According to a new report, contrary to its spotless reputation, **green hydrogen is not the key to the energy transition.**

**Green hydrogen:**

- It involves splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen **using electricity from renewable energy sources** like sunlight/wind.
- It accounted for only 0.04% of globally produced hydrogen in 2021.

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/global_hydro.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/global_hydro.png)**

**Limitations of the green hydrogen – dubbed as the ‘fuel of the future’:**

- **Energy inefficient** → 30% of renewable energy is lost while producing hydrogen.
- **Indirectly contributes to global warming** → when it reacts with hydroxyl radicals (responsible for breaking down and eliminating methane – a potent GHG) → could lead to delayed climate action.
- Large-scale production requires **vast amounts of land, water and renewable energy**, which could lead to **human rights violations and energy poverty.**

**How is the world progressing with green hydrogen?**

- **The European Union (EU):** Intends to increase green hydrogen production capacity as part of the bloc’s **REPowerEU plan** to 20 million tonnes.
- **India:**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/gh2-1.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/gh2-1.png)

**Why (in spite of obstacles) are countries making progress with green hydrogen?**

- Fossil or grey hydrogen accounts for 99% of the globally produced hydrogen.
- A **huge lobby** linked to fossil fuels is pushing the hydrogen agenda to lock in detrimental infrastructure, as well as production and consumption models.

**Conclusion:** The corporate-driven green hydrogen race unfolding in Europe follows centuries-old **colonial patterns** –

- Resources are being appropriated to fuel Europe’s economy,
- While negative impacts like ecological damage and land conflicts are conveniently outsourced to the periphery (African countries).

**Context:** India Meteorological Department (IMD) is planning to issue a heat hazard analysis for India, including Delhi.

- **IMD** will soon issue a **Heat Index** (in addition to the day’s maximum and minimum temperatures)

**What is Heat Index?**

It will be a colour-based warning that will give an **estimation of what temperature actually feels like**.

**It factors Day’s**

- Relative humidity
- Wind speed
- Maximum temperature
- Cloud cover.

**Usage of HI:**

- It will not only **warn against Heat waves hazard** but also list precautions people can take.
- Calculation of HI will **help states in formulating better Heat Action Plans (HAPs)** for heatwave assessment, forecast, preparedness and mitigation.

**What are heat waves?**

Heat waves are prolonged periods of excessively hot weather that may be accompanied by high humidity, often leading to a range of negative impacts on human health and the environment.

- The heat wave is considered if the **maximum temperature of a station reaches at least 40°C** for Plains and at **least 30°C for** Hilly regions.

### **Dawoodi Bohras**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/dispute-over-dawoodi-bohras-dai-what-is-the-case-in-bombay-hc-8522207/)

 **Context:** The Bombay HC will hear the dispute between the current leader of the Dawoodi Bohra sect and his challenger for the post.

 **Who are the Dawoodi Bohras?**

- They are **a religious denomination among Shia Muslims**.
- Traditionally a **community of traders and entrepreneurs**, it has over 5 lakh members in India and over 10 lakh members across the world.
- The top religious leader of the community is known as the **Dai-al-Mutlaq –** appointed through “divine inspiration”.
    - A “nass” (conferment of succession) can be conferred upon any deserving member of the community and not necessarily a family member of the current Dai, although the latter is often the practice.

**What is the dispute?**

- In 2014, the 52nd Dai-al-Mutlaq, Syedna Mohammad Burhanuddin passed away, and his son Mufaddal Saifuddin succeeded him.
- This was challenged by the late Syedna’s half-brother in the Bombay HC.

**The practice of ex-communication in the Dawoodi Bohra community:**

- The leader of the community has the **right to excommunicate** (not being allowed to access a mosque or a burial) its members (generally those who contested the headship of the leaders).
- However, the **Bombay Prevention of Excommunication Act 1949** invalidates the ex-communication of any member of any community.
- **A petition on the constitutional validity** of the practice is pending before the 9-judge Bench of the SC.
    - The bench was constituted to review the **2018 Sabarimala judgement** – considering larger issues of essential religious practice.

|**About the news**|**Description**|
|**Developed by**|**Centre for Development of Telematics** (C-DOT), under the Department of Telecommunications|
|**Quantum Hackathon 2023**|The government has opened a challenging round, for anybody who breaks this secure quantum system and system developed by C-DoT, we will be giving **Rs 10 lakh per break**|
|**What is Quantum Communication?**|It refers to **communication channels that leverage laws of quantum physics** (use of ‘qubit’ instead of ‘0’ and ‘1’) to protect data and make it more secure than traditional transmission.|
|**Working of Quantum Communication**|It uses **quantum properties such as entanglement and superposition** to transmit information, which **cannot be intercepted or copied without being detected by the sender and the receive**r. This makes quantum communication very secure and ideal for transmitting sensitive information such as financial transactions and classified messages.|
|**What is Quantum Key Distribution?**|QKD involves the **transmission of encrypted data** as classical bits while the **decryption key is encoded and transmitted in a quantum state** using qubits.<br><br>[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/QKD.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/QKD.png)|

 **Context:** Scientists have reported evidence of **the piezoelectric effect in liquids** for the **first** time, in pure ionic liquids at room temperature.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Piezoelectric Effect**|**Description**|
|**Definition**|An electric current is generated when a body is subjected to pressure<br><br>[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/electric_current.jpg)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/electric_current.jpg)|
|**Example**|Quartz|
|**Applications**|Analog wristwatches and clocks, cigarette lighters, electric guitars, TV remote controls, audio transducers, and other instruments where converting mechanical stress to a current is useful|
|**Discovery of piezoelectricity**|Discovered 143 years ago by Pierre and Jacques Curie (1880); observed only in solids until now|
|**Name**|Piezo (pressure) + Electricity|
|**New discovery**|Two ionic liquids at room temperature showed a piezoelectric effect (previously only Solids were thought to show this effect). The liquids also showed an inverse effect (they become distorted when an electric charge is applied)|
|**New applications of this discovery**|Using this effect, the liquids can be used as lenses with dynamic focusing abilities|

### **Sarus crane**

 **Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/booked-sarus-crane-wildlife-protection-act-explained-penalty-8522949/)

 **Context:** A man from UP was booked under the Wildlife Protection Act 1972, for “illegally” keeping and nursing an injured Sarus crane (Grus Antigone) he found in his village.

**Wildlife Protection Act 1972:**

- It **provides for the protection** (by prohibiting their hunting and by protecting their habitat) **of wild animals, birds and plants** to ensure the ecological and environmental security of the country.
- The Act prohibits **capturing or hunting any species of animals** listed under Schedules I-IV (**Sarus crane – Listed in Schedule IV**), barring a few exceptions such as hunting a diseased or dangerous animal or bird.
- Any person who contravenes any provision of the Act **shall be punished with up to 3 years imprisonment** or fine or both.

**2022 Amendment to the WPA (not yet enforced):**

- It seeks to **reduce the number of schedules from VI to IV**. Schedule V for vermin or animals that destroy food crops will be done away with.
- It seeks to **implement the provisions of CITES** – an international agreement between governments ensuring international trade of wild animals and plant species does not threaten their survival.
- If the offence relates to animals under the first two Schedules, **imprisonment can be between three to seven years**, with or without a fine.

**The Sarus crane:**

- It is a large **non-migratory** crane found in parts of the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and Australia.
- Standing at 152-156 centimetres, it is the **world’s tallest flying bird** classified as **‘Vulnerable’** on the IUCN Red List and is a **CITES Appendix II**
- In India, it is usually found in **wetlands** and is the **state bird of UP**.
