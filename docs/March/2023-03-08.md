#### **GS Paper 1**

**Syllabus:** **Geophysical phenomenon**

**Source:** [**HT**](https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-reports-542-forest-fires-in-last-7-days-highest-in-india-fsi-survey-101678162284798.html)

**Context:**  Forest fires continued to remain unabated in Odisha after the state recorded 542 such cases in the last seven days making it the highest among all states in the country.

**Forest fires in India:**

**Causes of a Forest fire:**

- **Natural:** Such as **lightning**, high atmospheric temperatures, and dryness (low humidity) offer favourable circumstances.
- **Man-made:** When a source of fire like naked flame, cigarette, or bidi comes into contact with inflammable material.

**Types of a forest fire:**

- **Surface fire:** Spread along the surface litter (leaves, twigs, dry grasses) on the forest floor.
- **Ground fire**: Fires in the **subsurface organic fuels**, such as duff layers under forest stands, burn **underneath** and are often ignited by surface fires.
- **Crown fire**: A crown fire is one in which the crown of trees and shrubs burn, often sustained by a surface fire.

**Good/bad:**

- **Helps in the evolution of forests** (such as dry deciduous forests and savannahs)**,**
- **Landscape/disease management** (indigenous people like the Soligas have used controlled forest fires to reduce incidences of tick-borne diseases),
- Controls the growth of **invasive species, etc.**
- However, forest fires can have **lasting negative impacts on biodiversity** (loss of flora, fauna, ecological services), the **economic stability** of many communities that live in forests, etc.

**Vulnerability:**

- ~**65%** of Indian forests are prone to occasional/frequent forest fire events.
- **Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh** were the most impacted states and **Gadchiroli, Kandhamal, and Bijapur** were the most impacted districts.
- The youngest mountain ranges of the **Himalayas**/chirr (Pine) forests (Western > Eastern as E. Himalayas grow in high rain density) are the most vulnerable stretches of the world.
- There has been a **10-fold increase** in forest fire incidences in the last two decades.
- According to the MoEFCC, the country **reported 3,45,989 forest fire** incidents during (Nov 2020 and June 2021) and the state of Odisha reported 51,968 – the highest in India.

**Impact of climate change:**

- It might lead to more wildfire-inducing ‘**hot lightning**’ strikes.
    - Hot lightning or l**ong continuing current strikes** (which can last up to a third of a second) are more likely to ignite wildfires than typical lightning strikes.

**Preparedness and mitigation measures:** Forest fires are usually **seasonal**. Hence, fires can be prevented in the summer –

- Through the removal of forest litter all along the forest boundary (“**Forest Fire Line**“).
- **By creating firebreaks**/ ditches in the forests.
- **The FSI is using satellite imaging technology** –
    - To set up fire alert systems (**MODIS, SNPP**) and analyse fire-affected forest areas
    - To better understand the ecology of forest fires for restoration and fire prevention efforts

**Context:** Landfill fires are becoming a big challenge for India’s urban civic bodies (recently in Kochi)

**Recent incidents:** Ghazipur, Delhi’s Bhalswa, and Chennai’s Perungudi

**What triggers landfill fires?**

●        A landfill site is **a site for the disposal of waste materials** and is the **oldest and most common** form of waste disposal.

●        The landfill sites in India are **not scientifically planned**.

●        The wastes are **not segregated** due to which the landfill sites receive mixed wastes which **include organic waste/ignitable material/plastics**.

●        **The anaerobic decomposition** (breakdown of organic waste in the absence of oxygen) generates **methane gas and heat**.

●        As soon as the methane gas comes in contact with oxygen, the combustible materials at the dumping site catch fire easily.

**Challenges:** The landfill fires take time to exhaust due to several factors which include –

●        **Multiple ignition points,**

●        **Lack of constant water supply** and

●        The danger involved in climbing the tall mounds of garbage.

**Way ahead:** The Solid Waste Management Rules 2016 state that **only non-recyclable, non-biodegradable, and non-combustible waste** should go to a sanitary landfill.

**Syllabus****: Social Justice – Welfare of vulnerable sections**

**Source:** [**The Hindu**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/the-importance-of-women-led-digital-solutions/article66591125.ece)**,** [**Live Mint**](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/india-needs-to-double-down-on-bridging-its-digital-gender-gap-11678040421197.html)

**Context:** The theme for International Women’s Day 2023 is ‘**DigitALL: Innovation and Technology for Gender Equality.**

**Data on Digital Disparity:**

- According to **a UNICEF report, as many as 90% of the jobs** in the world today have **a digital component.** These jobs, however, are available only to the **digitally able, and to more men than women.**
- According to the report, **in developing countries, only 41% of women have access to the internet compared with 53% of men**.
    - Women are **20% less likely to own a smartphone and are more likely to borrow phones from a male family member.**
- Another report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development revealed that the **gender gap in internet use is widening**. Software development remains a male-dominated field, with women comprising **only 15% of software designers**.

**Examples of how digital literacy helps in tackling issues:**

- The **FoSafMDM application** by the **United Nations World Food Programme (WFP)** in partnership with the **Governments of Odisha and Rajasthan has rolled out technology-based training modules**
- This helps in **strengthening the capacity of the community** in ensuring that proper hygiene and safety measures **are followed so that children reap the full benefits of the nutrition that these school meals offer.**
- Young women known as ‘**Digital Sakhis’ from Madhya Pradesh are upturning discriminatory social norms through the use of smartphones**.

**Indian situation:**

- India accounts for **half the world’s gendered** [**digital divide**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/science-technology/communication-and-it-technology/digital-divide/#:~:text=Digital%20divide%20is%20any%20uneven,or%20geopolitical%20criteria%2C%20or%20otherwise.) given that **only a third of all Internet users in the country are women.**
- In Asia-Pacific**, India has the widest gender gap of 40%. Less than 32% of women in India own a mobile phone compared to over 60% of men.**

**Conclusion:**

- Women can harness digital tools for improving nutrition schemes and initiatives, while also using them to **create economic opportunities that ensure long-term food and nutrition security**.
- **Women20—the G20’s official engagement platform** to promote gender equity—**identifies “bridging the gender digital divide”** as one of its five priorities that need to be mainstreamed as part of the G20 agenda this year.

**Context**: A group of scientists, at the Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, has come up with a solution where **healthy skin cells from an adult can be converted into heart cells using special proteins**.

**More about the technology:**

- According to scientists, **converting cells from one form to another – a.k.a. cellular reprogramming – involves specific proteins, called transcription factors**, that alter the “expression of genes within a cell and direct it to take on a new cellular identity”.
- They developed a toolbox, which consists of six recombinant proteins: **GATA4, MEF2C, TBX5, ETS2, MESP1, and HAND2**.
- Each of these proteins plays a significant role in **reprogramming fibroblasts** – a type of cells that provides structure to tissue – **into cardiomyocytes**.
- The advantage of **recombinant proteins-based cell conversion** is they work their miracle inside the nucleus and eventually disappear over time **without leaving behind their toxic waste, unlike their genetic counterparts.** Thus, they are very safe for reprogramming compared to other approaches

**Context**: The Indian Navy has carried out a successful test-firing of a Medium Range Surface-to-Air Missile (MRSAM) and a ship-launched version of BrahMos missile

**About BrahMos:**

BrahMos is a **medium-range ramjet supersonic cruise missile** (two-stage missile —Solid+ Liquid propellant) that can be launched from a submarine, ship, aircraft, or land having a range of 450 km.

- It is a joint venture of **India and Russia** and it’s named after the rivers Brahmaputra and Moskva.
- Operates **on Fire and Forgets principle**

**About MRSAM:**

**MRSAM weapon system** which is also called the **‘Abhra’ Weapon System** is a state-of-the-art medium-range air defence weapon system and is a joint venture of **DRDO** and **Israeli Aerospace Industries (IAI)** and produced at Bharat Dynamics Limited (BDL).

It is designed to **destroy hostile aircraft, helicopters cruise missiles and drones** at a 70km range

**Significance:**

The test firing **validated the capability to engage** the weapon as an anti-ship missile
