### [How are the CEC and ECs appointed, and what has the Supreme Court order changed?](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/03/how-are-the-cec-and-ecs-appointed-and-what-has-the-supreme-court-order-changed/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Appointment to various Constitutional Posts, Powers, Functions and Responsibilities of various Constitutional Bodies**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/chief-election-commissioner-appointment-explained-supreme-court-ruling-8474745/)

 **Context:** A five-judge Constitution Bench of the SC **unanimously ruled that a high-power committee** consisting of the **PM, the Leader of Opposition in LS and the CJI** must pick the CEC and ECs.

**How are the** [Chief Election Commissioner (CEC)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/05/14/chief-election-commissioner-2/) **and Election Commissioners (ECs) currently appointed?**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/articles.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/articles.png)

**The Election Commission (Conditions of Service of ECs and Transaction of Business) Act 1991:**

- An amendment to the above act (in 1993) made the CEC and the ECs equal by giving all three the **status of an SC judge**, retiring at the age of **65 years/after 6 years** (whichever is earlier).
- This means, all three Commissioners now had **equal decision-making powers**, as both would act unanimously and **in case of difference of opinion, the majority view** would prevail.

[Powers of the Election Commission](https://www.insightsonindia.com/governance/appointment-to-various-constitutional-posts-powers-functions-and-responsibilities-of-various-constitutional-bodies/eci/functions-and-responsibilities/)**: as envisaged in the Constitution, by the Supreme Court of India & the Parliament**

- **Babasaheb Ambedkar:** The whole election machinery should be in the hands of a Central Election Commission.
    - He further acknowledges that **there is nothing in the Constitution to prevent the nomination of an ineligible person** to the position of CEC or another EC.
- **Parliament subsequently enacted the RPA 1950 and 1951:** To define and enlarge the powers of the Commission.
- **The SC (in 1977):** The words **‘superintendence, direction and control’** as well as ‘**conduct of all elections’ are the broadest terms**, not defined by the Constitution.

[Reputation of the ECI & the need for reforms](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/22/editorial-analysis-benchmarks-for-ecs-appointments/)

- The Commission has earned **public trust** by working as an **independent and neutral authority**.
- This achievement has been made possible as the Commission enjoyed **autonomy and its functioning insulated** from the interference of the executive and judiciary.
- However, there were growing concerns on that front. **For example,** the top court noted that the **appointment of Arun Goel as EC had been carried out with “lightning speed”.**

**Recommendations to** [reform the system](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/11/26/editorial-analysis-securing-the-ec/)**:**

- Ambedkar noted that the provisions in the **American Constitution:** check (through the Senate) upon the extravagance of the President in making such appointments.
- **The 2nd ARC** in 2007 recommended that a collegium headed by the PM be formed to make recommendations to the President regarding appointments of the CEC and ECs.

**SC’s observations during its recent verdict:**

- The judgment has brought the appointment process on par with that of the [CBI Director](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/11/16/ordinances-to-extend-the-tenures-of-the-directors-of-cbi-and-ed/).
- A CEC (like SC judges) can be removed from office only by way of a parliamentary process. However, **no such protection of** [tenure](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/11/23/sc-calls-out-centre-over-short-tenures-of-cec/) **is available** to the **ECs** (removed by the President if CEC recommends).
- A person weak-kneed before the powerful (executive) cannot be appointed as an EC.
- Fierce [independence](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/21/editorial-analysis-upholding-the-autonomy-of-the-election-commission/)**, neutrality and honesty** envisaged in the institution require an **end to government monopoly and “exclusive control”** over appointments.

**Conclusion:**

- The judgment recognises the fine distinction between **conventional democracy (majority alone matters)** and **constitutional democracy (Constitution matters**).
- The judgment revives the era of [judicial activism](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/structure-organization-and-functioning-of-the/judiciary/judicial-activism-and-judicial-over-reach/#:~:text=Judicial%20activism%20must%20also%20function,rare%20cases%20as%20mentioned%20above.), ensuring **a more independent** Election Commission.

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Infrastructure (Energy)**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/analysis-india-cheers-the-return-of-king-coal-as-industry-sees-buoyant-future/article66566682.ece)

 **Context:** After a 3-year pandemic break, **the** [coal industry in India](https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-economy-3/infrastructure/energy/coal/) **welcomed back its major conference** (Coaltrans India conference) with a positive forecast of demand, increased production from new mines and strong demand for imports.

**The prosperous future of the coal industry in India:**

- **Increased output:** The production in the first 10 months of FY22 reached **25 million tonnes**, up 16% over the same period a year ago.
    - It will jump to a**round 1.4 billion tonnes per annum by 2030** from around 1 billion tonnes currently.
- **Acceleration in Imports:** India’s imports (10.19 mt in February) of seaborne thermal coal are likely to accelerate, especially since the government mandated power plants to operate at full capacity as the summer demand peaks.
- **Increased imports of coking coal:** It is expected that coking coal imports will rise from around 63 mt a year currently to around 100 mt by 2030, given the expected increase in **steel production.**
- **Increased private participation:** Private mining companies are expected to make a bigger contribution to domestic output as they start bringing mines to production.

**Challenges:**

- Can **Coal India**, the state-controlled miner that accounts for about **80%** of the country’s total output, continue to ramp up production?
- India’s commitment to **“phase down**” coal-fired power generation and achieve [net zero carbon emissions by 2070.](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/11/02/india-will-achieve-net-zero-emissions-by-2070/)
- Will India be able to source sufficient i**mports at a price that its utilities can afford?**

**Whether this additional coal the industry expects to produce will actually be needed?**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**No**|**Yes**|
|●        India is **rapidly rolling out renewable energies**<br><br>●        The share of renewables was at 27% in 2022 and is expected to rise to at least 40% by 2030<br><br>●        In the 2021-22 FY, some 15.5 GW of renewable capacity was installed, but only 1.4 GW of new coal-fired generation|●        Rising power demands<br><br>●        Thermal generation still accounts for **59% of India’s total capacity**<br><br>●        India is building new (32 GW) coal-fired power plants<br><br>●        Each GW of generation requires around 3 million tonnes of coal annually|

**Conclusion:** Overall, it appears the positive mood of India’s coal sector is justified, especially in the short term. But their forecast of enormous growth in output and demand for many years may turn out to be too optimistic.

### [Coral reefs damaged: What’s the big deal?](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/03/coral-reefs-damaged-whats-the-big-deal/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Environment, Conservation, Pollution**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/coral-reefs-8474109/)

 **Context:** [Coral reefs](https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/unique-ecosystems-degradation-and-management/coral-ecosystem/) are not looking too healthy as [increased ocean temperature](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/07/07/sansad-tv-nature-and-you-ocean-warming-is-alarming/) caused by climate change is the main cause of coral bleaching events.

**Coral reefs:**

- These are **limestone structures** (found in more than 100 countries) built by thousands of tiny coral creatures called **polyps** and belong to tropical areas.
- The planet has **already lost about half of its shallow-water corals** in the past three decades.
- At the current rate, up to **90%** of them will disappear by the middle of the century.

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/coral.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/coral.png)**

**Significance of reefs:**

- Coral reefs (rainforests of the sea) **cover less than 0.5%** of the earth’s surface, but they have **rich biodiversity** – home to about 25% of all marine species.
- A vast resource of potential scientific discoveries (pharmaceuticals of tomorrow). **For example**, the anticancer agent Ara-C is found in sea sponges on a Caribbean reef.
- About one billion people source their food or **income** directly from reefs.
- **Provide shelter and function as nursery grounds** for some commercially important fish (grouper and snapper), as well as invertebrates (lobster).
- **Flood protection protects coastal communities** from storm surges and waves.
- Reduces coastal erosion.
- With climate change triggered extreme weather events, **reefs will play an even more important role.**

**What if reefs are not protected?**

- **Threats to marine biodiversity.**
- **Potential food shortages** especially when combined with failing crops from climate change.
- **Mass migration**, as people try to avoid famine and flooding.

**Way ahead:**

- Local restoration efforts by transplanting coral
- The establishment of **marine protected areas** which work like national parks
- Stopping run-off from agricultural and effluence
- **Controlling climate change**, which presents the biggest single threat to the future of coral reefs

### [Myanmar teak trade: Highly prized, highly dodgy](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/03/myanmar-teak-trade-highly-prized-highly-dodgy/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Source:** [**Indian Express**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/myanmar-teak-trade-highly-prized-highly-dodgy-8476232/)

 **Context**: After the military junta took control of Myanmar, **the state-owned company, which had** **exclusive rights over the country’s precious timber and teak trade**, also came under the military.

- There was a number of timber auctions since the coup and sales of this “**conflict” wood,** **pro-democracy supporters allege, are a key revenue stream for the military regime.**

**Importance of Myanmar teak:**

- Teak from Myanmar’s **deciduous and evergreen forests** is considered the **most tensile and durable hardwood, resistant to water and termites**.
- It is in demand for **high-end furniture, veneer and ship decking** – much sought-after by the **luxury yacht industry**.

**Illegal harvesting of timber and teak from Myanmar:**

- There have been increased instances of illegal trade of Myanmar timber; **Global Forest Watch** says the country, over the last two decades**, has lost forest cover roughly the size of Switzerland.**
- **International NGO Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) released data**, which showed that over 70% of the logs exported from Myanmar between 2000-2013**, were illegally harvested.**

**Global regulations to tackle illegal trade:**

- **The European Union introduced the EU Timber Regulation (EUTR**), which put the onus on timber merchants to do **sufficient due diligence to disallow illegal timber from entering their markets**.
- Myanmar **itself banned the export of whole logs.**

**Impact on Indian Traders:**

- Following the ban on the export of whole logs, a new regulation came in for only **teak in “sizes” to be exported**.
- **India is looked upon as a leakage country** for illegally exporting timber.

**Loopholes present:**

- Claiming that the price **for the timber was paid before the 2021 coup.**
- Trade data reveals some **Indian companies simply put “Asia” in the column for the origin of the wood**, without specifying which country
- In **transit passes they signed, traders wrote “imported” in the** space for declaring where the teak was purchased from.

**Solutions:**

- **Strengthen enforcement of existing laws**
- **Increase transparency in the supply chain**
- **Enhance international cooperation**
- **Address the demand side of the problem**: Illegal logging persists because there is a market for illegal timber.
- **Tighten regulations on Indian traders**: India needs to strengthen its regulations on the import of timber and crack down on companies that are involved in illegal trade.
