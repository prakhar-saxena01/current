### [Steps taken to boost the Indian tea industry](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/04/steps-taken-to-boost-the-indian-tea-industry/)

#### **GS Paper 1**

 **Syllabus: Indian Geography, Cropping Pattern**

**Source**: [PIB](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1903590)

**Context:** India has taken several steps to boost the output, create a niche brand for Indian tea and ensure the welfare of the families associated with the tea industry.

- Indian tea exports are expected to achieve more than **95% of its target of about US $ 900 million**

|**Tea in India**|   |
|---|---|
|**About**|Tea is a popular beverage made from the **Camellia sinensis plant** and is the **second most consumed drink** in the world.|
|**Origin**|Tea is believed to have originated in **northeast India, north Myanmar, and southwest China**, with evidence of consumption in China over **5,000 years ago**.|
|**Growth Conditions**|Tea requires a **hot and humid climate**, temperatures of **20°-30°C, and 150-300 cm** of well-distributed **annual rainfall**. It grows well in **slightly acidic soil with porous subsoil in the hill ranges**.|
|**Health Benefits**|Tea consumption can **promote health and wellness** due to its **anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and weight-loss effects.**|
|**International Tea Day**|It is observed on **May 21st every year** and was designated by the United Nations General Assembly in December 2019.|
|**Production**|India is the **second-largest producer of tea globally (**largest black tea producer**)**, with the majority of its annual tea production coming from **Assam and West Bengal**. The southern part of India also produces tea.|
|**Consumption**|India is among the **world’s top tea-consuming countries**, with 80% of its production consumed domestically.|
|**Export**|India is **4th largest tea exporter** globally and exports to over 25 countries. The majority of tea exported is black tea, with Darjeeling, Assam, and Nilgiri tea being among the finest in the world.|
|**Geographical Indication (GI) Tag**|**Darjeeling tea, known as the “Champagne of teas,”** was the first GI tag product.|
|**Regulator**|The **Tea Board of India** (a **statutory** body under the **Ministry of Commerce**) is responsible for developing and promoting the tea industry in India.<br><br>·         **HQ**: Kolkata, formed in 1953<br><br>·         **Foreign Offices**: Dubai and Moscow|
|**Employment**|Indian tea Industry is **employing 1.16 million workers** directly and an equal number of people are associated with it indirectly|

### [Clean-tech as the next big thing in rural India](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/04/clean-tech-as-the-next-big-thing-in-rural-india/)

#### **GS Paper 2/3**

**Syllabus:** **S&T/Government Programmes/Role of Women and Women’s Organization**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/clean-tech-as-the-next-big-thing-in-rural-india/article66577539.ece)

 **Context:** Women from rural India are adopting **clean energy-based livelihood technologies** (from solar refrigerators to silk-reeling machines) to catalyse their businesses and **transform women’s livelihoods at the grassroots.**

**Highlights of a study (by CEEW):**

- Out of the 13,000 early adopters of clean tech livelihood appliances, **more than 80% are women**.
- **Distributed renewable energy** (DRE)-powered technologies provide an additional advantage to women farmers **by enhancing income opportunities** through mechanisation.
- They also **free women from several gender-assigned manual activities** that are laborious.
- By 2030, India is expected to see **30 million women-owned MSMEs** employing around 150 million people.

**Challenges in scaling up these accomplishments:**

- N**ovelty and a high starting price** of **these technologies**
- Perceived as **high-risk purchases**, especially by women users
- **The relatively lower risk appetite** of rural women due to **socioeconomic reasons**
- Limited avenues to avail financing
- Lack of established market linkages
- Limited mobility/networks of women outside their villages

**Way ahead – How to scale up this impact?**

- Leverage the experience of early women adopters.
- Organise hyperlocal events and demos – create **spaces for women to network**, and become aware.
- Enable easy finance to purchase products. Financiers should consider the technologies themselves as **collateral while easing the loan application process.**
- Ensure adequate after-sales services and buy-backs.
- **Support backwards and forward market linkage** – finding and connecting producers to consumption hubs in urban areas.
- **Collectivising women or establishing business models** that enable them to sell to an intermediary can ensure a regular revenue stream.
- **Enable policy convergence.** Efforts towards promoting livelihoods for women from State rural livelihood missions, agriculture departments, etc., must be converged.
- **Leveraging the reach of government institutions** is imperative.

**Best practice:** **Kissan Dharmbir**, an energy-efficient food processor manufacturer, engaged an Agra-based micro-entrepreneur using the processor to produce jams, **as a demo champion**.

**Conclusion:** Similar to how it takes a village to raise a child, a village of politicians, investors, financiers, and technology promoters, is required to fully realise the potential of rural women and clean technologies.

### [ILO–UNICEF joint report on social protection for children](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/04/ilo-unicef-joint-report-on-social-protection-for-children/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus****:** Welfare schemes for vulnerable sections of the population

**Source:** [DTE](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/world/globally-just-1-in-4-children-covered-by-social-protection-un-report-88051#:~:text=Published%3A%20Friday%2003%20March%202023&text=Only%2026.4%20per%20cent%20of,United%20Nations%20(UN)%20report.)**,** [UNICEF](https://www.unicef.org/media/135211/file/More%20than%20a%20billion%20reasons:%20The%20urgent%20need%20to%20build%20universal%20social%20protection.pdf)

 **Context:** Only **26.4 per cent(just 1 in 4 children)** of children aged 0-15 years are shielded by social protection, leaving the remaining **73.6 per cent** exposed to poverty, exclusion and multidimensional deprivations, noted a new United Nations (UN) report titled – **More than a billion reasons: The urgent need to build universal social protection for children.**

**Need for Social Protection:**

- Social protection policies are **powerful tools for alleviating poverty for children and their families at risk of falling into poverty** and helping all children deprived of key services.
- Social protection can also shield children from **other major risks, such as** [child labour](https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/issues-related-to-children/child-labour/) **and forced labour.**

**Key findings of the report:**

- **2.4 billion** **Children in this world need adequate** social protection.
- Nearly 1.77 billion children aged 0-18 years **lack access to a child or family cash benefit**, a fundamental pillar of a social protection system
- **Regional disparities**
- **One billion children live in** [multidimensional poverty](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/01/11/sansad-tv-perspective-multidimensional-poverty/) without access to education, health, housing, nutrition, sanitation or water.
- **Gender disparity**
- Children **with disabilities or living in a household with a family member with a disability are** more vulnerable to poverty

**Stats on India in the report:**

- The report stated that **31 states in India had implemented the national** [‘PM CARES for Children’ scheme.](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/10/06/pm-cares-for-children/) So far, only **4,302 children have received support from the scheme.**

**Recommendations given to achieve universal social protection for children:**

- Provide a comprehensive range of benefits that supports children and families through **a life-cycle approach.**
- Authorities are advised to **provide child benefits through national social protection systems** that also connect families to crucial health and social services, such as **free or affordable quality childcare.**
- **Increase budget allocation** for children: Ensure **sustainable and equitable financing of social protection systems**
- **Build social protection systems that are rights-based, inclusive, gender-responsive, informed by social dialogue and able to effectively respond to multiple shocks and crises**, and that can therefore deliver for children and families.
- **Guarantee access to decent work** and adequate employee benefits.
- Ensure that **social protection systems are adapted to developments in the world of work to** enhance **economic security** for parents, caregivers and their families.

**Conclusion:** Following the above recommendations will help us achieve the **Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) of achieving substantial social protection coverage by 2030.**

### [Our forests are under threat – here’s how they are certified](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/04/our-forests-are-under-threat-heres-how-they-are-certified/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Environment, Conservation**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/forests-under-threat-deforestation-investigation-8478180/#:~:text=Forest%20certification%20in%20India&text=Forty%20one%20divisions%20of%20the,Conservation%20of%20Forests%20(NCCF).)

 **C****ontext:** The **certification industry offers a multi-layer audit system** that seeks to authenticate the origin, legality, and sustainability of forest-based products such as timber, etc.

**Background:**

- With [climate change](https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/climate-change-and-associated-issues/), [deforestation](https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/environment-degradation-and-issues/deforestation-and-forest-degradation/) **has become a critically sensitive** issue globally.
- Forests absorb large amounts of CO2, **keeping a check on** [global warming](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Global-Warming-and-its-Effect-on-India.pdf)**.**
- At the [Glasgow climate meeting (2021)](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59088498), more than 100 countries took a pledge to stop and reverse deforestation by **2030**.
- **Europe and the US** have passed laws that regulate the entry and sale of forest-based products in their markets. This is where the **certification industry** comes in.
- The industry, through **independent third-party audits**, helps in establishing whether forests were being **managed in a sustainable manner**.

**Two major international standards for sustainable management of forests and forest-based products:**

- Developed by Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) – More popular and expensive
- Developed by Programme for Endorsement of Forest Certifications (PEFC) – Endorses the ‘national’ standards of any country

**How will they work?**

- Organisations like FSC/PEFC are only the **developers and owners of standards** like, for example, the ISO/BIS.
- They are **not involved in the evaluation and auditing** of the processes.
- That is the **job of certification bodies** authorised by the FSC or PEFC.

**Two main types of certification on offer:**

- Forest management (FM)
- **Chain of Custody (CoC):** Guarantees the traceability of a forest product like timber throughout the supply chain from origin to market.

**[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/coc-1.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/coc-1.png)**

**Forest certification in India:**

- Though the industry has been operating in India for the last 15 years, **forests in only one state (UP) are certified.**
- **41 divisions** of the UP Forest Corporation (UPFC) are PEFC-certified and are managed according to the standards developed by the nonprofit **Network for Certification and Conservation of Forests** (NCCF).
- Some other states too obtained certification. However, all of these expired over time.
- **Many agroforestry projects** (paper mills, etc), meant for captive use of the industry, too have forest management certification.

**Challenges:**

- There are a large number of CoC certifications, but the **dropout rate is 40%.**
- **India’s wood import bill is Rs 50,000-60,000 crores per year.**
    - India’s forests contribute just about **five million cubic metres** (5%) of wood every year.
    - Almost **85%** of the demand is met by **trees outside forests** (ToF) and about **10%** is imported.
- India allows the export of only processed wood, not timber.

**Way ahead:**

- **India-specific standards:** Since ToF are so important, new certification standards are being developed for their sustainable management.
- **The government’s own standards:** The corruption in the private certification space has come under sustained criticism.

**Conclusion:** A simple, transparent, easy to adopt and internationally accepted i**ndigenous system of certifications** will take into account India’s national circumstances and will make available sustainably grown and managed forest products in the domestic market.

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Environment, Conservation, Pollution**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/energy/a-plateau-global-co2-emissions-rose-less-than-initially-feared-in-2022-says-iea-88038#:~:text=Global%20energy%2Drelated%20carbon%20dioxide,analysis%20by%20the%20International%20Energy)

**Context:** According to the **IEA’s ‘CO2 Emissions in 2022’** report, global energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions rose by **under 1% in 2022.**

**Background:**

- The report is the first in a new series, the **Global Energy Transitions Stocktake**, which will bring together the IEA’s latest analysis in one place.
- This will make it freely accessible in support of the first Global Stocktake in the lead-up to the **COP28 Climate Change Conference** (Dubai, UAE).

**About the report:**

- It covers CO2 emissions from **all energy combustion and industrial processes.**
- It also includes information on **methane and nitrous oxide emissions**, providing a complete picture of energy-related greenhouse gas emissions in 2022.

**Important takeaways from the report:**

- Global energy-related CO2 emissions grew by **0.9%**/321 million tonnes in 2022, reaching a new high of more than **36.8 billion tonnes.**
- The rise in emissions last year was **far smaller** than the exceptional jump of **over 6% in 2021.**
- However, the report called for **stronger actions to accelerate the clean energy transition** to move the world towards **meeting its energy and climate goals**.

**Reasons behind better results in 2022:** Growth of solar, wind, electric vehicles, heat pumps and energy efficiency helped limit the impacts of increased use of coal and oil amid the global energy crisis.

**Region-specific findings:**

- **China’s emissions were broadly flat in 2022** due to strict Covid-19 measures.
- **The EU emissions fell by 2.5%**, thanks to the record deployment of renewables and energy savings measures in response to **Russia’s invasion of Ukraine** also contributed.
- **In the US, emissions grew by 0.8%** as buildings increased their energy consumption to cope with extreme temperatures.
- Excluding China, **emissions from Asia’s emerging and developing economies** increased **by 4.2%,** reflecting their rapid economic and energy demand growth.

**Fuel-by-fuel analysis:**

- CO2 emissions from **coal** grew by **1.****6%** as the global energy crisis continued to spur a wave of gas-to-coal switching in Asia.
- The increase in coal emissions balanced the **1.****6%** decline in emissions from **natural gas** as supplies were limited by [Russia’s invasion of Ukraine](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/03/editorial-analysis-positing-indias-stand-on-the-ukraine-war/).
- CO2 emissions from **oil** grew by 2.5% (came mainly from the aviation sector) but still remained below pre-pandemic levels.

### [Roadmap to energy justice](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/04/259758/)

**GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus:** **Energy, Environment, Conservation**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/hardeep-s-puri-writes-roadmap-to-energy-justice-8586248/)

**Context:** India’s energy strategy is presently recognised as being pragmatic and balanced since it is motivated by assuring energy access, availability, and affordability for its vast population.

**What is energy justice?** Energy justice envisions elements of a global energy system that **fairly distributes both energy services’ benefits and burdens** and can be used as a framework to identify energy injustices.

**Short-term actions towards ensuring energy justice in India:**

- **Massive cuts in excise duty and VAT rates of** petrol and diesel.
- **An export cess** on petrol, diesel and ATF.
- **Windfall tax** on domestically produced petroleum products to prevent refiners and producers from profiteering at the cost of domestic consumers.
- **Subsidised administered pricing mechanism** (APM) gas for the city gas distribution sector was drastically increased.
- **R**[**evising the New Domestic Gas Pricing Guidelines 2014**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/10/changes-in-the-domestic-gas-pricing-formula/) to rationalise and reform [APM](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/10/changes-in-the-domestic-gas-pricing-formula/) gas pricing.

**Outcome:**

- **Prices of diesel in India have gone down in the last year:** This is when petrol and diesel prices went up by 35-40% in global markets, India imports over 85% of its crude oil requirements and 55% of its natural gas requirements.
- **No shortage of fuel anywhere in India:** This is when several neighbourhood countries have had dry outs and power cuts to manage demand.

**Long-term actions towards ensuring energy justice:**

1. **Expanding the network of crude oil suppliers:** This strategic decision not only ensured affordable energy for Indian consumers but also had a calming effect on global petroleum markets.

2. **Strengthening ties:** With countries like the US (energy trade has gone up 13 times in the last four years) and Russia to ensure a reliable supply of crude oil.

**Expanding petrochemical production**:

- India is a global exporter of petroleum products and its r**efining capacity is the fourth largest** in the world after the US, China, and Russia.
- Efforts are underway to further enhance this capacity to 450 MMT by 2040.

3. **Innovation and investments in exploration and production (E&P): India wants to boost its net geographic area** under exploration from 8% to 15% (**0.5** million sq km) by 2025 and has reduced the prohibited/no-go areas in EEZ by 99%.

4. **Energy transition:** However, as demonstrated at Glasgow, India is committed to becoming **net-zero in emissions by 2070**.

5. **Moving towards a gas-based economy:**

- By increasing the share of gas from the current **3** to 15% by 2030.
- India has connected **more than 9.5 crore families** with clean cooking fuel in the past nine years.
- **PNG connections** have increased from **28** lakh in 2014 to over 1 crore in 2023.
- **The number of CNG stations** in India has gone up from 938 in 2014 to 4,900 in 2023.
- Since 2014, India has increased the **length of its gas pipeline network** from 14,700 km to 22,000 km in 2023.

6. **Biofuel revolution:**

- At the recent India Energy Week 2023, India launched **E20** – 20% ethanol blended gasoline – which will be expanded across the country in the next two years.
- **India’s ethanol-blending gasoline** has grown from just **53% in 2013-14 to 10.17% in 2023.**
- India is also setting up **five 2nd generation ethanol plants**, which can convert agricultural waste into biofuel → **reducing pollution** due to stubble burning → **generating income** for farmers.

7. **Developing the entire green hydrogen ecosystem:**

- The Na**tional Green Hydrogen Mission** has been launched with an outlay of Rs 19,744 crore to accelerate India’s efforts towards –
    - 4 MT of annual green hydrogen production and
    - Rs 1 lakh crore of fossil fuel import savings by 2030.

8. **An integrated path for transitioning India’s future mobility pathways:**

- Along with green hydrogen and biofuels, India is also supporting **electric vehicles through a production-linked incentive scheme**.
- **India is targeting the installation of alternative fuel stations** (EV charging/CNG/ LPG/LNG/CBG etc.) at 22,000 retail outlets by May 2024.

**Conclusion:**

- According to IEA estimates, India will account for **~25% of global energy demand growth** between 2020-2040.
- As India aspires to become a $26 trillion economy by 2047, implementing **a unique strategy for ensuring energy security and achieving energy independence** is the need of the hour.

**GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus:** **Linkages between Development and Spread of Extremism**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/maoist-challenge-needs-political-understanding-not-over-reliance-on-security-8590318/lite/)

**Context:** The efficacy of the Maoist movement needs to be gauged in terms of their declining social base, not on the basis of how many violent incidents occur.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|[**Maoist movement in India**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/27/left-wing-extremism-lwe/#:~:text=The%20left%2Dwing%20extremism%20(LWE,Chinese%20political%20leader%20Mao%20Zedong.)|   |   |
|**Current approach**|**Expected outcome**|**Issues**|
|**Use of Force**|The use of force (including specially-trained forces such as the Greyhounds) has led to a **decline in Maoist presence and the use of more force will end its remaining influence**.|The use of more force **only helped the Maoists recruit** from the local tribal population.<br><br>The Maoist movement moved from the leadership of outsiders (mostly from Telangana) to that of **local tribals.**<br><br>**Such internal changes** led to **local support for the movement** from tribals in Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand.|
|**Development**|Welfare and development as part of the “strategy” to calm down and make the Maoists irrelevant.|**The D Bandyopadhyay Committee** (2006) stated that land alienation and poverty among STs and Dalits, and lack of access to basic forest resources contributed to the growth of Naxalism.<br><br>The state’s model of development has resulted in the **displacement of tribals** → leading to the peaceful Pathalgarhi movement in Jharkhand|

**What led to the failure of the above approaches:**

- Declining Maoist presence/violence could well be **a political strategy of the Maoists to go silent/underground** and wait for lapses on the part of the security forces.
- **Eminent Domain doctrine,** argues that all resources belong to the nation and can be extracted in the “national interest”.
- Development is seen as a **zero-sum game** by either side leads.
- **A single conception of development** to address the various, occasionally incompatible demands of oppressed groups.
- **The securitisation paradigm** is also insufficient to comprehend social exclusion.

**Conclusion:**

- Both Ambedkar and Gandhi were of the view that social exclusion and caste cannot be addressed through violence.
- To end the social exclusion of tribals there is the need to understand that development is a **multi-faceted process**.

**Context:** The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the European Union’s financial markets regulator and supervisor, has **derecognised six Indian central counterparties** (CCPs) from April 30, 2023.

What are **Clearing corporations (CC)?**

CC is an organization associated with an exchange to handle the confirmation, settlement, and delivery of transactions in a prompt and efficient manner.

**Examples of CCs:**

The CCPs are The Clearing Corporation of India (CCIL), Indian Clearing Corporation Ltd (ICCL), NSE Clearing Ltd (NSCCL), Multi Commodity Exchange Clearing (MCXCCL), India International Clearing Corporation (IFSC) Ltd (IICC), and NSE IFSC Clearing Corporation Ltd (NICCL).

**Why has ESMA derecognized Indian CCs?**

The decision to derecognise Indian CCPs came due to **‘no cooperation arrangements’** between ESMA and Indian regulators – the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and the International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA).

**Impact:**

As per the European Market Infrastructure Regulations (EMIR), a CCP in a third country can provide clearing services to European banks only **if it is recognised by ESMA**. With the withdrawal of recognition, these CCPs will **no longer be able to provide services to clearing members** and trading venues established in the EU.

**Government’s stand** – ESMA’s threat is unreasonable since all clearing corporations are well-regulated in India.

### **Salt flats around the world are covered in a similar pattern of ridges****.**

 **Source:** [The Hindu](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/salt-flats-around-the-world-are-covered-in-a-similar-pattern-of-ridges-why/article66571741.ece#:~:text=What%20explains%20this%20finding%3F,to%20leave%20more%20salt%20behind.)

 **Context**: In salt flats across the world, the salt on the surface forms ridges that join together in a patchwork of pentagons and hexagons.

**What are salt flats?**

- A salt flat is a **natural landscape in which a large area of flat land is covered by salt.**
- World’s most well-known salt flat is the **Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia** contains more than half of the planet’s [lithium reserves](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/11/discovery-of-lithium-deposits-in-jk-to-cut-dependence-on-imports/).
- A salt flat **forms from a natural water body whose recharge rate is lower than the evaporation rate**. **The underlying soil is highly saline: even if the water table is shallow, the groundwater is too salty for humans to drink.**

**How are the shapes form?**

- The researchers began with the hypothesis that the salt on the surface is influenced by the salt flowing through the soil below. They found that the **salt penetrated deeper into the soil exactly below the ridges, and remained shallow under the flat areas.**

To mitigate the deleterious effects of salt flats, **experts have recommended covering them in a shallow layer of water, so that the salt is deposited on the surface more uniformly and less salt is carried away by winds.**

**Context**: India’s wealthy individuals have **invested all their surplus foreign remittances in various securities** over the last few months to comply with a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) diktat that ended last week.

- **In August 2022 RBI had directed** that any **money remitted overseas** by Indian residents that remains unutilised for more than 180 days needs to be repatriated back into India.

**What is** **[Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS)?](https://m.rbi.org.in/scripts/FAQView.aspx?Id=115)**

Under LRS (introduced in 2004), **Indian individuals** can send money outside up to a maximum of **$250,000** in a **year**.

- **Aim**: LRS simplifies the process of remitting money outside India and encouraging foreign investments by Indian individuals.
- **Permissible transactions:** education, travel, medical treatment, gifting, investment in shares or property, etc.
- **Non-Permissible transactions:** Trading in foreign exchange or buying lottery tickets.
- **LRS is not available to** Corporations, partnership firms, Hindu Undivided Family (HUF), Trusts etc.
- **Benefits of LRS:** Individuals can diversify their investments and assets, and also provides an opportunity to finance their foreign education or travel.
- **Issues:** Outward remittances can add pressure to the forex reserves of the country and therefore the government has proposed a **20% Tax Collection at Source (TCS)** for any foreign remittance transactions in FY24.

**The objective of the committee is threefold**:

- To assess the factors that **have led to market volatility**
- To examine if there has been a **regulatory failure in this case**
- To **suggest measures to strengthen the regulatory apparatus** and ensure compliance with the existing framework to protect investors.

However, there has been doubt about the **opacity of the committee’s selection process**.

SEBI has also conducted an investigation and will examine Adani stocks’ market activity before and after the report’s publication.

- **The stock market is regulated by SEBI under SEBI Act 1992** to protect the interest of investors in securities.

 **Context**: Huge blooms of **phytoplankton — microscopic algae floating on the ocean’s surface** — have **become larger and more frequent along the world’s coastlines**.

- Marine animals such as **fish and whales eat phytoplankton**
- It can be toxic in large amounts, st**arving the ocean of oxygen and leading to “**[dead zones](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/06/17/dead-zone-in-the-gulf-of-mexico/#:~:text=What%20are%20dead%20zones%3F,agriculture%20%E2%80%93%20a%20phenomenon%20called%20eutrophication.)**” that wreak chaos on the food chain and fisheries**.

**Reason for increase in phytoplankton blooms:**

- [Warmer sea surface temperatures](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/07/07/sansad-tv-nature-and-you-ocean-warming-is-alarming/) appear to be behind the boom.
- Changes in climate can also mess with ocean circulation**, affecting the mixing between ocean layers and how nutrients move around the ocean.**
- **Human development also plays a role**. Fertilizer runoff from **agriculture can spike nutrient loads in the ocean, leading to blooms.**
