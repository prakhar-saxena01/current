### [Understanding IMF bailouts](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/27/understanding-imf-bailouts/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Important International Institutions, agencies and fora – their Structure, Mandate**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/explained-understanding-imf-bailouts/article66665548.ece)

 **Context:** The [International Monetary Fund (IMF)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/international-relations/important-international-institutions-agencies-and-further-structure-mandate-etc/imf/) confirmed a $3 billion bailout plan for Sri Lanka’s struggling economy and is also in negotiations with Pakistan for a $1.1 billion bailout plan.

**Background:**

- The IMF was set up in **1945: as** an outcome of the **Bretton Woods conference**.
- The primary goal of the IMF back then was **to bring about international economic coordination to prevent competing currency devaluation** by countries trying to promote their own exports.
- Eventually, the **IMF evolved to be a lender of last resort** to governments of countries that had to deal with severe currency crises.

**Why do nations seek an IMF bailout?**

- **Central banks mismanagement** → forced by governments (populist spending) → create fresh money → rapid rise in the money supply → prices rise → exchange value of the currency drops → destroy confidence in the currency.
- **A country’s domestic economic policies** (that imperil productivity) can also have an adverse impact on its currency’s exchange rate and foreign exchange reserves.
- **Bad luck can also contribute to a crisis**. For example, **a decrease in foreign tourists visiting Sri Lanka** led to a steep fall in the flow of U.S. dollars into the nation.
- In such a scenario, many countries (facing a major macroeconomic risk/currency crisis) are forced to seek help from the IMF **to meet their external debt and other obligations**, to purchase essential imports, etc.

**How does the IMF help countries?**

- The IMF basically lends money, often in the form of **special drawing rights (SDRs)**, to troubled economies through a number of its lending programs such as the
    - The extended credit facility,
    - A flexible credit line,
    - Stand-by agreement, etc.
- SDRs simply **represent a basket of five currencies**, namely the U.S. dollar, the euro, the Chinese yuan, the Japanese yen, and the British pound.
- Countries can use the SDRs **for various purposes** depending on their individual circumstances.

**Strings attached to an IMF bailout:**

- The IMF usually imposes **conditions on countries** before it lends any money to them.
- **For example,** a country may have **to implement certain structural reforms** as a condition to receive IMF loans.

**The Pros and Cons of IMF’s conditional lending :**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Cons**|**Pros**|
|●       Too tough on the public<br><br>●       Influenced by international politics|●       Essential for the success of IMF lending<br><br>●       Throwing money without reforming policies that caused the crisis/corruption does not make sense<br><br>●       Ensures independence of its central bank|

[The 1991 Indian economic crisis](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2015/11/11/insights-into-editorial-bop-crisis-and-rupee-devaluation-mindmaps-on-issues/)**:**

●       It resulted from **a balance of payments deficit** due to excess reliance on imports and other external factors.

●       The Government of India’s **immediate response was to secure an emergency loan of $2.2 billion from the IMF** by pledging 67 tons of India’s gold reserves as collateral security.

●       The crisis paved the way for the [liberalisation of the Indian economy](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2014/12/14/effects-liberalization-indian-economy-society/), since one of the conditions stipulated in the World Bank and IMF loan (structural reform), required India to open its economy.

 **Context:** The Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) in its report suggested that India should target **USD 350 billion worth of goods exported through e-commerce by 2030**

India’s current e-commerce export numbers remain far below their potential. Currently, e-**commerce exports account for only USD 2 billion, less than 0.5 per cent of the country’s total goods export basket.**

**Suggestions:**

- Government should issue a **separate e-commerce export policy**. Such **policies in countries including China, Korea, Japan, and Vietnam, have helped many firms sell globally.**
- **Redefining responsibilities of sellers; simplifying payment reconciliation and processes; developing business ecosystem**; and setting up a **National Trade Network** for the medium.

### **What is Biotransformation technology**

 **Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/explained-what-is-biotransformation-technology/article66656794.ece#:~:text=What%20is%20Biotransformation%20technology%3F,Britain%2Dbased%20startup%2C%20Polymateria.)

 **Context:** A UK-based startup claims to have developed a technology – “biotransformation” – that could alter the state of plastics and make them biodegradable.

**Background:**

- India generates **5 billion kgs of plastic waste annually** and the per capita plastic waste generation has also doubled in the past five years.
- The Indian government –
    - Introduced a **plastic waste management gazette** to help tackle the ever-growing plastic pollution caused by single-use plastics.
    - Imposed a **ban on single-use plastics** to bring a stop to their use in the country.
- **The National Dashboard** on Elimination of Single-Use Plastic and Plastic Waste Management brings all stakeholders together to track the progress made.
- An **Extended Producer Responsibility** (EPR) portal helps in facilitating ease of compliance reporting in relation to EPR obligations of the producers, importers and brand-owners.

**What is Biotransformation technology?**

- It is **a novel technology** that would digest plastic waste naturally with the help of microbes and biodegrade the waste without leaving behind any microplastics.
- **Food packaging and healthcare industries** are the two prime sectors that could use this technology to reduce waste.
- This will ensure that plastics escaping refuse streams are **processed efficiently and broken down.**

**Alternatives to reduce plastic waste:**

- A switch to **jute or paper-based packaging** could potentially cut down plastic waste.
- **The Government of Tamil Nadu** showcased alternatives made using coir, bagasse, rice and wheat bran, etc.

### **Weapons containing depleted uranium**

**Source:** [Indian Express](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/britain-depleted-uranium-ukraine-explained-8520252/)

 **Context**: British government recently said that it would **provide Ukraine with armour-piercing rounds containing depleted uranium**.

Though they aren’t considered nuclear weapons, **they emit low levels of radiation and can cause severe diseases.**

**What is depleted uranium?**

- Depleted uranium is a **by-product of the process of creating enriched uranium**, which is used in **nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons**. In comparison to enriched uranium, depleted uranium is **much less radioactive and is incapable of generating a nuclear reaction**.
- However, due to its high density — **it’s denser than lead — depleted uranium is widely used in weapons as it can easily penetrate armour plating.**

**Which countries have depleted uranium munitions?**

- Apart from the **US, Britain, Russia, China, France and Pakistan** produce uranium weapons, which are **not classified as nuclear weapons, as per the International Coalition to Ban Uranium Weapons**.

**What are the risks of using such weapons?**

- **Ingesting or inhaling quantities of uranium** – even depleted uranium – is dangerous: it depresses renal function and raises the risk of developing a range of cancers.
- Moreover, **according to the International Coalition to Ban Uranium Weapons, depleted uranium munitions which miss their target can poison groundwater and soil.**

**Where have depleted uranium munitions been used?**

- **1991 Gulf War to destroy T-72 tanks in Iraq**.
- **1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia and,**
- **During the 2003 invasion of Iraq.**

**Context**: The government recently launched the **Aravalli Green Wall Project**, a major **initiative to green the 5 km buffer area around the Aravalli Hill Range** in **four states** at a function organised to celebrate the International Day of Forests in Haryana.

**About Aravalli Green Wall Project**

- The Aravalli Green Wall Project is **part of the Union Environment Ministry’s vision** to create green **corridors across the country to combat land degradation and** [desertification](https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/environment-degradation-and-issues/desertification/#:~:text=Desertification%20is%20the%20process%20by,and%20dry%20sub%2Dhumid%20areas.)**. The project covers the states of Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Delhi** – where the Aravalli hills landscape span over 6 million hectares of land.
- The project will **involve planting native species of trees and shrubs on scrubland, wasteland and degraded forest land, along with rejuvenating and restoring surface water bodies such as ponds, lakes and streams.**

**Objectives:**

- Improve the **ecological health of the Aravalli range**
- **Prevent the eastward expansion of the Thar Desert** and reduce **land degradation**

help in **carbon sequestration and mitigate climate change**

- **Promote sustainable development and livelihood opportunities** by involving local communities in afforestation, agro-forestry and water conservation activities that will generate income, employment, food security and social benefits.
- **Contribute to India’s commitments under various international conventions** such as **UNCCD** (United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification), CBD (Convention on Biological Diversity) and **UNFCCC** (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change).
