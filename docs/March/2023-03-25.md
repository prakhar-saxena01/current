### [Western Disturbances: Science behind unseasonal rains and hailstorms](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/25/western-disturbances-science-behind-unseasonal-rains-and-hailstorms/)

#### **GS Paper 1**

**Syllabus****: Geography –** Important Geophysical phenomena such as earthquakes, Tsunami, Volcanic activity, cyclones etc

**Source:** [DTE](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/climate-change/here-is-the-science-behind-unseasonal-rains-and-hailstorms-that-flattened-crops-in-india-88446)

**Context**: Recently **large parts of the country experienced hailstorms** which **were also accompanied by torrents of rain**.

- The hail and rains have led to **extensive damage to standing crops in many states, such as Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Punjab.**

**Causes:**

- The rainfall and the storms **were caused by multiple** [western disturbances (WD),](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/04/18/western-disturbance/) other WD-**associated weather systems and many troughs, which are extended low-pressure areas, formed due to the interaction of the WDs** and associated systems with winds blowing in from the east, mainly the Bay of Bengal.
- A **warming Arabian Sea could also be responsible for the intense storm activity** and rain.
- The IMD also cited a **strong subtropical** [westerly jet stream](https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-geography-2/indian-climate/indian-monsoon/mechanism-of-formation-of-indian-monsoon/recent-concepts/role-of-jet-streams/#:~:text=Sub%2Dtropical%20westerly%20jet%20stream%3A%20It%20dominates%20in%20winter%20time,height%20of%20about%2012%20km.), a band of winds that circles the **subtropical regions of the planet in the upper layers of the** [troposphere](https://www.insightsonindia.com/world-geography/physical-geography-of-the-world/climatology/structure-composition-of-atmosphere/#:~:text=Troposphere%20means%20%E2%80%9Cregion%20of%20mixing,18%20km)%20above%20the%20equator.)**, as a reason for the storm activity.**
- This was aided by the **incursion of moisture-laden winds from the Bay of Bengal and** the lowering of the freezing level in the atmosphere, which helped in the formation of hail.

**About Western Disturbances:**

- Western disturbances are **extra-tropical** **storms that originate in the Caspian or Mediterranean Sea**, **which is an area of low pressure & bring sudden showers(non-monsoonal), snow and fog to northwest India.**
- These **travel eastwards on high-altitude westerly jet streams**– massive ribbons of fast winds traversing the earth from west to east.

**Context:** Recent studies have shown that the w**arming of the Arctic and the Mediterranean Sea** means **that Western Disturbances are striking India less in winter** and more in summer; with **catastrophic consequences.**

**Reason for weakening Western Disturbances:**

- **Climate Change**

One of the reasons for the **abnormally hot February was the formation of a high-pressure area near the land surface, which caused the air to descend, compress and heat up.**

**Importance of Media:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Importance**|**Explanation**|

|**Promoting Debate and Discussion**|The media has the ability to **raise important issues and encourage debate and discussion**, which are essential for a functioning democracy.<br><br>E.g., Coverage of topics like **climate change and human rights** violations, #MeToo movement|
|**Accountability**|The media acts as a **watchdog by monitoring the actions** of those in power and holding them accountable for their actions.|
|**Importance for democracy**|The media is the **fourth pillar of the State** and an integral component of democracy.|
|**Voice of the common man**|**Local or community-based journalism** has played an important role in encouraging **social cohesion and political activism**.|

**Classification of Biofuels:**

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/biofules.jpg?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/biofules.jpg)**

### **Odisha introduces Bill to ease land acquisition**

 **Source:** [Indian Express](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/bhubaneswar/odisha-introduces-bill-to-amend-central-law-ease-land-acquisition-8515554/)

**More about the bill:**

- The Odisha government **aims to do away with the mandatory provision of social impact assessment (SIA) study before the land acquisition, which, it says, is a time-consuming process.**
- The state government through the ‘**Make in Odisha’ initiative intends to attract private investments in mega projects across sectors to fast-track the development process**. Providing hassle-free land to the **project proponents is one of the basic requirements for industrial and infrastructure development.**
- Projects like **affordable housing, industrial corridors set up by the state government, infrastructure projects, including highways and railways and industrial projects involving displacement of 100 families or less, or acquisition of private land of 500 acres or less will also be exempt from conducting mandatory SIA.**
