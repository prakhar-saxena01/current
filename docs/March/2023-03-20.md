### [What is India’s stand on same-sex marriage?](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/20/what-is-indias-stand-on-same-sex-marriage/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus:** **Mechanisms, Laws, Institutions and Bodies constituted for the Protection and Betterment of these Vulnerable Sections**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/explained-what-is-indias-stand-on-same-sex-marriage/article66636166.ece)

**Context:** A Bench led by CJI referred petitions to legally recognise same-sex marriages **to a Constitution Bench of five judges** of the SC.

**What is the case?**

- Even if LGBTQIA+ couples may live together, they do not enjoy the rights married couples do.
- **For example,**
    - They cannot adopt children or have a child by surrogacy;
    - They do not have automatic rights to inheritance, maintenance and tax benefits after a partner passes away,
    - They cannot avail of benefits like pension or compensation.
- The Court has been hearing multiple petitioners’ requests for **legal recognition of same-sex marriages** under the **Special Marriage Act (SMA) 1954** and making the law **gender-neutral**.

**How has the SC recently viewed LGBTQIA+ rights?**

- **In Navtej Singh Johar** **(2018) case** [decriminalised homosexuality by reading down [Section 377](https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/issues-related-to-third-gender-lgbtqia/section377/) (IPC)], the SC held that the community is entitled to the benefit of equal citizenship and to the equal protection of the law.
    - **Article 21** of the Indian constitution (right to life and liberty) guarantees the choice of whom to partner with, the ability to find fulfilment in sexual intimacies, etc.
- **In K.S. Puttaswamy’s (2017) case**, SC ruled that the fundamental right to privacy (including bodily autonomy, and sexual orientation) is intrinsic to life and liberty and thus integral to Article 21.
- After these judgements, there was hope that same-sex marriages would be legalised, but that has not been the case, prompting many couples to move to court.

**What is the Centre’s stand?**

- **Opposed** same-sex marriage and said **judicial interference will cause complete havoc with the delicate balance of personal laws**.
- This definition of marriage is **socially, culturally and legally** ingrained into the very idea of the heterogeneous institution (a union between two persons of the **opposite sex**) of marriage.
- The decriminalisation of Section 377 IPC does not give rise to a claim to seek recognition for same-sex marriage.
- Even if same-sex marriage is claimed under Article 21, **the right can be curtailed by the competent legislature** on permissible constitutional grounds including legitimate state interest.

**Way ahead:**

- It is clear that the **two organs of the state are not in agreement** on same-sex marriages.
- Even if the Court rules in its favour, the march towards same-sex marriage **in a diverse country with well-entrenched traditions will not be easy.**
- Therefore, **awareness of sex, gender and constitutional rights** from the school level to change things on the ground is the need of the hour.

**Context:** In January this year, about eight billion (800 crores) transactions worth nearly $200 billion (Rs. 2 lakh crores approximately) were carried out on the Unified Payment Interface (UPI)

**What is Digital Payment System?**

A digital payment sometimes called an electronic payment, is the transfer of value from one payment account to another using a digital device such as a mobile phone, POS (Point of Sales) or computer.

**Modes of Digital Payments:**

- Unified Payments Interface (UPI)
- Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM)
- UPI 123PAY
- UPI Lite
- Cards (including RuPay Debit Cards)
- Immediate Payment Services (IMPS)
- Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AePS)

**Status of Digital payments in India:**

- **40% of all payments** done are digital
- **Nearly 50 per cent** of them are classified as **small or micropayments**
- **The value of instant digital transactions** in 2022 was **four times more** than the combined transactions in the United States, Britain, Germany, and France together.

**Components of Digital Payment Ecosystem:**

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ecosystem.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ecosystem.png)**

**Tools used for Digital Payment ecosystem:**  

- **JAM trinity**
    - **Jan Dhan Accounts:** As of 2022, over 46 crore bank accounts have been opened, with 56% belonging to women and 67% opened in rural and semi-urban areas
    - **Aadhar:** Today 99% of adults have a biometric identification number with more than **1.****3 billion** IDs issued.
    - **Mobile**: The cost of data dropped by 95% since 2016.
    - **JAM Trinity** has catapulted verticals such as e-commerce, food delivery, and OTT content to take off in India.
- [**Unified Payments Interface**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/05/the-unified-payments-interface-upi/) **(UPI)** (launched in 2016 by NPCI with 21 member banks): It is a public-private partnership (PPP) that the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) led with an interoperable platform to facilitates direct payments linked to a bank account.
    - An advanced version of **Immediate Payment Service (IMPS),** UPI manages multiple bank accounts into a single mobile application (of any participating bank), merging several banking features, seamless fund routing & merchant payments into one hood.

### [PM inaugurates the Global Millets (Shree Anna) Conference](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/20/pm-inaugurates-the-global-millets-shree-anna-conference/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus:** **Issues relating to Poverty and Hunger**

**Source:** [**PIB**](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1908322)

**Context:** At the inaugural edition of the **global conference on millets**, the PM of India spoke about how millets, considered to be “**high-fibre foods**”, are effective for health.

**Background:**

- Based on India’s proposal, the year **2023** was declared the **International Year of Millets** (IYM) by the UNGA.
- In order to make the IYM 2023 a **‘people’s movement’** and position India as the **‘**[global hub for millets](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/12/sansad-tv-special-report-millet-food-of-future/)**’**, all stakeholders are being engaged to spread awareness about the benefits of millets (Shree Anna) for the –
    - **Cultivator,**
    - **Consumer and**
    
- The organisation of the **Global Millets (Shree Anna) Conference** in India is an important programme in this context.
- It was organised by the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (**APEDA**), Ministry of Commerce and Industry.

**PM’s address at the Conference:**

- As Shree Anna is linked with Gaon as well as Garib (Village and the poor), **it is becoming a medium of holistic development in India**.
- Shree Anna –
    - **A door to prosperity for the small farmers** of the country.
    - **The cornerstone of nutrition** for crores of countrymen.
    - **Felicitation of the Adivasi community**.
    - Getting more crops for less water.
    - A big foundation for **chemical-free farming** and a huge help in fighting **climate change.**

**Consistent efforts of the Indian government to turn Shree Anna into a global movement:**

- **Millets were declared nutri-cereals in 2018** → making the farmers aware of its benefits, and generating interest in the market.
- Millets have been selected in 19 districts of the country under the ‘**One District, One Product**’ scheme.
- The National Food Security Mission (NFSM) as **NFSM-Coarse Cereals** and implemented in 14 States.
- In 2021, the **PM POSHAN** (earlier known as the mid-day meal scheme) was approved to include millet to enhance the nutritional outcome.
- India is planning to launch a global initiative – Millet International Initiative for Research and Awareness (**MIIRA**), to encourage the consumption and production of millets.

**Impact of these initiatives:**

- **Consumption/month/person** from 3 to 14 kgs today.
- The sale of millet food products was **boosted by roughly 30%.**

### [Water warning: How ‘vanishing’ rainfall is threatening economic stability](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/20/water-warning-how-vanishing-rainfall-is-threatening-economic-stability/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus:** **Conservation, Environmental Pollution and Degradation**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/water-warning-economic-stability-vanishing-rainfall-8503886/)

 **Context:** According to a Global Commission on the Economics of Water report, **human activities** (from destroying forests to burning gas-oil-coal for energy) **are disrupting the rainfall the world depends on.**

**Background:**

- The report comes **ahead of a key U.N. Water Conference** – the first in five decades – aimed at charting a path to shore up declining global water security.
- According to 2021 data from UN-Water, about **3 billion people** (almost one in three) live in water-stressed countries and a third of those facing critical pressures.
- According to the **UN FAO 2020 report**, **2 billion** living in agricultural areas face high to very high water scarcity or shortages.
- **Behind all the SDGs** (Sustainable Development Goals), there is a volume of freshwater that powers the delivery of services.

**Findings of the report:**

- **Impact of losses of forests:** Argentina’s soybean and wheat fields are experiencing worsening drought as the Amazon shrinks (water vapour rising from rainforests falls on distant places).
    - This is further aggravated by land use change and **climate change.**
- **Huge economic, health and social stability threats:**
    - Eroding water security poses **a risk to everything from food supplies to hydropower production**, a key source of low-carbon energy.
    - For example, severe water scarcity in the Horn of Africa has the potential to trigger **political instability, conflict, displacement and migration.**

**Recommendations – Rethinking water:**

- A deeper understanding of how closely water supplies are linked to climate and nature protection.
- Looking at **freshwater as a global rather than just a local or regional issue**, and strengthening how limited supplies are managed, shared and valued.

**Challenges:**

- A desire to capture and store more water is leading to **a surge in dam-building around the world,** which often results in losses of forests, land rights of local communities, etc.
- Increasing water storage in river dams can lead to **growing tensions with neighbours downstream**.
    - **For example**, the India-Pakistan conflict over more dam-building on the Indus River system.
- With agriculture responsible for more than 70% of global freshwater use each year, **trade in food is also trade in water.**

**Way ahead:**

- Improving water security requires a shift towards –
    - More precise and sparing irrigation systems,
    - Crops that require less water,
    - Farming methods that stand up to drought and grow fewer thirsty crops in water-short places.
- **In urban areas**, boosting freshwater storage, recycling more wastewater and using less water in manufacturing will be key.
- Richer nations should help poor countries in their water conservation efforts (financially, tech transfer).
- **Just Water Partnerships**, modelled on existing Just Energy Transition Partnerships – designed to speed a global transition to clean energy, should also be considered.

**Conclusion:** The U.N. Water Conference can be a “**Paris moment**” [[2015 Paris Agreement](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/07/08/financial-and-technological-commitments-under-unfccc-and-paris-agreement/) on Climate Change] for water. This will ensure a sustainable and globally equitable future – that’s in every nation’s interest.

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus****: Environment – Coastal Erosion**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/climate-change/coastal-crisis-it-s-a-race-against-time-and-tide-for-those-living-in-odisha-s-coastal-villages-here-s-why-88054)

**Context:** Data from the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management, shows that 74 villages in the state of Odisha are **severely affected by shoreline erosion—the highest in the country**.

- A study paper published in the journal Spatial Information Research in June 2018 finds that almost **half of Odisha’s coast—196 km of shoreline—has undergone erosion between 1990 and 2015.**
- A major reason for **this is the** [**rising sea level**](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/sea-level/)**, which is surging along the Odisha coast** at a rate faster than the rest of the country.

**About** [**Coastal Erosion**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/world-geography/physical-geography-of-the-world/geomorphology/external-forces-their-impact/landforms-developed-out-of-external-forces/erosion-by-water/coastal-erosion-and-landforms-thus-formed/)**:**

- Coastal erosion is the **temporary or permanent loss of land owing to the action of waves, currents, tides, wind-driven water, waterborne ice, or other effects of storms**.
- It can also be the **long-term removal of soil and rocks along the shoreline**.

**Reasons for Coastal Erosion:**

**Natural reasons**

- **Wave energy**
- **Natural hazards**
- **El Niño** and effects of **climate change (e.g., sea level rise).**

**Anthropogenic reasons**

- **Mining activities** such as **sand and Coral mining.**
- **Fishing harbours and dams** were constructed in the catchment area of rivers and ports.

**Impact of Coastal Erosion:**

**Solution:**

- **Green belts and artificial reefs help** in the mitigation of coastal erosion.
- **Coastal habitats** such as **Mangroves, Coral Reefs, and lagoons** are recognized as the best defence against sea storms and erosion, deflecting and absorbing much of the energy of sea storms.

- **Using Geosynthetic tubes:** currently being used along the coast in Odisha.

- Union environment ministry prepared **an Integrated Coastal Zone Management Plan (ICZM**) to be implemented on a **pilot basis in Odisha, along with two other states prone to shoreline erosion—Gujarat and West Bengal.**

|---|---|
|**Jhamarkotra**<br><br>[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Jhamarkotra.jpg?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Jhamarkotra.jpg)|·        It is a stromatolite fossil park: it hosts stromatolites dating back 1.8 billion years, exhibiting a variety of textures and sizes.<br><br>·        A **stromatolite is a layered sedimentary rock created by microorganisms**. As such, stromatolite fossils preserve records of **cyanobacteria, commonly known as blue-green algae – the earliest life on the planet.**<br><br>·        **Jhamarkotra’s fossils are phosphate-rich** because the trapped sediments were mainly phosphate minerals.|
|**Zawar**<br><br>[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Zwara.jpg?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Zwara.jpg)|·        The world’s **oldest known zinc-smelting site** – of **archaeological and metallurgic importance**.<br><br>·        The landscape around Zawar bears **numerous traces of zinc mining and smelting operations in ancient times**, including open **stopes, trenches, chambers, galleries, shafts, and open-pit mines.**<br><br>·        Before the advent of high-pressure technology, extracting zinc was a considerable challenge. Zinc has low boiling and melting points, so heating it forms a vapour, which readily oxidises in contact with the atmosphere. However, the **people of Zawar extracted zinc using a distillation process that required the use of a retort and an external condenser.**|

### **Vaikom Satyagraha**

 **Source:** [TH](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/satyagraha-that-heralded-modernity-in-kerala/article66623426.ece)

 **Context**: Kerala Government will organise the **centenary** celebrations of the Vaikom Satyagraha

**Vaikom Satyagraha** (1924-25) was a movement in Travancore (modern-day Kerala) for temple entry of the depressed classes. It took place near the Shiva Temple at Vaikom, Kottayam district, Kerala.

**Issue**: The protest was against the caste-based discrimination prevalent in Kerala and the rest of India, where lower-caste Hindus were not allowed to enter temples, and roads leading to temples were banned from them.

**Leaders**: K. Kelappan, T K Madhavan, Velayudha Menon, K Neelakantan Namboothiri, and T R Krishnaswami Iyer

- **Sree Narayana Guru** also extended the Satyagraha his support and cooperation
- **M Gandhi:** On Gandhi’s guidance, a march of ‘upper caste’ Hindus who supported the Vaikom Satyagraha began in Vaikom

**Impact**: It led to the Temple Entry Proclamation in 1936.

### **Quantum Error  Correction**

 **Source:** [**BS**](https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/google-makes-breakthrough-in-quantum-computing-which-is-much-bigger-than-ai-123031700148_1.html#:~:text=Four%20years%20ago%2C%20Google%20said,one%20part%20of%20the%20puzzle.)

 **Context:** Google makes a breakthrough in quantum computing, much bigger than AI—Quantum error correction

**What are the current issues in Quantum Computing?**

Currently, Quantum computers use qubits, to **encode information as 0’s, 1’s**, or both at the same time. However, qubits are very sensitive and even a stray light can cause calculation errors.

**Solution:**

Quantum error correction protects information by encoding it across multiple physical qubits (instead of relying on individual physical qubits) to form a “logical qubit”

**Significance**: It would go on to make quantum computing more accurate.

**Quantum Supremacy:** Four years ago, Google said it completed a test in 200 seconds for a task that would take conventional supercomputers thousands of years.

**The principles behind quantum technology:**
