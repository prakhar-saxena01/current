### [India not on-target in many women-related development goals](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/10/india-not-on-target-in-many-women-related-development-goals/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus:** **Social Justice (Issues related to women)**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/data/india-not-on-target-in-many-women-related-development-goals/article66591271.ece#:~:text=The%20critical%20off%2Dtarget%20indicators,districts%20analysed%20were%20off%2Dtarget.)

**Context:** A recent analysis (in The Lancet) has concluded that India is not on-target to achieve 19 of the 33 SDGs indicators.

**Background:**

- The SDGs were adopted by the UN in **2015** with a vision to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all.
- India is **one of the signatory countries** that has committed to achieving these goals by **2030**.

 **[![Current Affairs](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/un-goals.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/un-goals.png)**

**Achievements: The 5 indicators** with the highest number of districts that **have met the target** area –

- Adolescent pregnancy
- Multidimensional poverty
- Electricity access
- Bank accounts
- Improved sanitation
- Full vaccination
- Internet use
- Skilled birth attendants

**The critical off-target indicators**:

- Access to basic services
- Wasting and overweight children
- Anaemia
- Child marriage
- Domestic violence
- Tobacco use
- Modern contraceptive use

**Worst performer:** More than 75% of the 707 districts analysed were off-target, concentrated in the States of **MP, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Bihar, and Odisha**

**Focus areas of 2023 International Women’s Day (March 8):**

- The 2023 IWD was commemorated under the theme **“DigitALL: Innovation and technology for gender equality”.**
- However, women’s lack of access to technology and digital tools makes them less likely to be a part of the wider domains of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics **(STEM) fields.**
- **Globally**, 18% of girls in higher-level education are pursuing STEM studies, compared with 35% of boys.

**Case of India – The gender gap in STEM:**

- According to the All India Survey of Higher Education (2020-2021), in UG, PG, MPhil and PhD **engineering** programmes, 71% of enrolled students were males and **29% were females.**
- But of all students enrolled in **science** courses at UG, PG, MPhil and PhD levels, **women at 53%** of enrolment outnumbered men.

**Why does the gap exist?**

- Presence of existing resources such as mentors and programmes offering scholarships
- General **societal attitudes** on women’s education
- **Gender bias in curricula**. In India, more than 50% of illustrations in math and science textbooks show boys and only 6% show illustrations of girls.

**Recent initiatives/achievements by/of the GoI:**

- To mark the IWD 2023, the Union Ministry of Science & Technology announced **an exclusive women’s portal** for research grants and funds under **CSIR-ASPIRE**.
- 68% of 2 crore **PM Awas-Gramin** beneficiaries are women and over 23 crore **MUDRA loans** have been granted to women beneficiaries.
- For the first time, **sex ratio in India** has improved to 1,020 women per 1,000 men (NFHS-5).
- **Permanent Commission for Women** in the Armed Forces. Over **10,000 Women Officers** are currently serving in the Armed Forces, the majority in the Medical Services.
- Group Captain **Shaliza Dhami** – the first woman officer to command a missile squadron in the Western sector facing Pakistan.

### [The ideal track to run India’s logistics system](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/10/the-ideal-track-to-run-indias-logistics-system/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus:** **Infrastructure: Energy, Ports, Roads, Airports, Railways etc**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/the-ideal-track-to-run-indias-logistics-system/article66600836.ece)

**Context:** The Union Budget 2023 has doubled the **PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan** to States to ₹10,000 crores, and has announced an outlay of **₹2.4 lakh** crore for the **Indian Railways**.

**Why is the increased adoption of the railways crucial?**

- **The Railways** → pan-India network → **offers an efficient and economic mode of logistics movement** → enabling a **coordinated and** **integrated** logistics system.
- **To improve India’s logistics competitiveness.**
    - In 2020-21, coal constituted 44% of the total freight movement of **1.****2 billion** tonnes, followed by iron ore (13%), cement, food grains, fertilisers, etc.
    - Transportation of **non-bulk commodities accounts for a very small share** of the rail freight movement.

**Challenges faced by Indian railways:**

- The national transporter faces several **infrastructural, operational and connectivity challenges**, in turn leading to a **shift of freight traffic to roads** (**65%**).
- The effect is an increased burden on roads, congestion, pollution, and **resultant logistics cost escalations** (nearly twice the rail cost).
- An increase in containerised traffic (for non-bulk commodities) over the last decade.
- **The absence of integrated first and last-mile connectivity** by rail increases the chances of damage due to multiple handling and also increases the inventory holding cost.

**Global examples:**

- Globally, railway systems are **heavily investing in advanced rail infrastructure** for quick and low-cost container movement.
- **For example**, **China** uses special trains to carry containers that connect significant ports to the inland.

**Role to be played by the PM Gati Shakti:**

- It provides the right platform to address the infrastructural challenges that have hampered the movement of freight by rail.
- **Target** – Increasing the share of the railways in freight movement from **27% to 45%** (from **1.****2 to 3.3** billion tonnes) by **2030**.

**Way ahead to achieve the targets of rail freight movement:**

- C**ontinuous monitoring of existing projects** (like PM Gati Shakti) along with identification of new priority areas.
- **Improve infrastructure** that is backed by adequate policy tools and also encourage private participation.
- For example, the upcoming **Dedicated Freight Corridors** and multimodal logistics parks will ease the oversaturated line capacity and improve the train timings.
- **Establishing a special entity** under the railways to handle intermodal logistics will help in addressing the **first and last-mile issues** faced by the railways.

**Conclusion:** An integrated logistics infrastructure with first and last-mile connectivity is essential to make rail movement competitive with roads, and facilitate exports by rail to neighbouring countries such as Nepal and Bangladesh.

### [Gene-editing in embryos](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/10/gene-editing-in-embryos/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/science-technology/gene-editing-in-embryos-is-concerning-new-study-shows-why-88139#:~:text=The%20extensive%20copying%20of%20genetic,of%20diseases%2C%20the%20researchers%20explained.)

**Context:**  A new study published in the **journal Nature Communications** has warned of the potential consequences of **gene editing technology**, which is still not fully understood.

**Key findings:**

- **Using Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (**[**CRISPR**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/science-technology/biotechnology/what-is-crispr-cas9/)**)** to delete harmful disease-causing mutations could create more problems
    - CRISPR could lead to **extensive gene copying** from one parent to another, potentially increasing the risk of diseases
- The extent of the **DNA damage induced by CRISPR** and how cells respond to it is still not fully known
- The technology used to **test gene-edited embryos** could reduce the accuracy of genetic testing, leading to the misdiagnosis of embryos.
- The researchers concluded that **such limitations must be addressed** before gene editing technology can be used.

Previously, a **Chinese scientist** who announced the birth of **gene-edited twins in 2018**, had used CRISPR to make the embryos resistant to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

**About Gene-editing:**

**Genome editing** (also called gene editing) is a group of technologies that allow genetic material to be added, removed, or altered at particular locations in the genome.

- **Three technology mostly used for gene-editing are** [CRISPR-associated protein 9](https://www.insightsonindia.com/science-technology/biotechnology/what-is-crispr-cas9/) (Cas9), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs).

### [Artificial intelligence: Comparing the types and their impacts](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/10/artificial-intelligence-comparing-the-types-and-their-impacts/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus:** **Science and Technology- Developments and their Applications and Effects in Everyday Life**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/explained-will-artificial-intelligence-lead-to-job-displacements/article66597029.ece#:~:text=In%20industries%20like%20healthcare%2C%20for,the%20displacement%20of%20some%20jobs.)

**Context:** AI can traditionally be divided into **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI).**

**AGI and ANI:** The difference lies in their scope of intelligence and their ability to generalise knowledge across different contexts.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**AGI**|**ANI**|
|●       **Flexible and adaptable**<br><br>●       Designed to perform a wide variety of intellectual tasks **without human intervention**<br><br>●       **Unsupervised learning** means that the AI system can **learn from data** without being explicitly programmed to do so<br><br>●       **Lack of control** continues to learn and make decisions (**based on incomplete or uncertain information**) that even its creators cannot possibly predict.<br><br>●       In the realm of **theoretical** research and development.|●       Designed to perform a single or a narrow set of related tasks.<br><br>●       Not necessarily capable of reasoning or learning in the way that humans do.<br><br>●       Typically trained using **machine learning algorithms** such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, or reinforcement learning.<br><br>●       Widespread use in a variety of industries and applications<br><br>●       For example, **ChatGPT – is** a chatbot which allows users to engage in a conversation about a variety of topics.|

**Advantages of AI:**

- Disruptive technology **creates new jobs and skill sets** by creating demand for expertise in machine learning, data science and natural language processing.
- It will transform industries by **creating new opportunities for growth and innovation.**
- **In industries like healthcare**, AI can optimise transportation networks, develop new materials, and even simplify manufacturing processes.

**Threats:** ChatGPT/similar solutions **are proficient at automating routine and repetitive tasks** (data entry, customer service) which could perhaps **replace low-skill level workers**.

**Conclusion:** The impact of AI on jobs and industries is likely to be **uneven**. Hence, **significant investment in education and training programs** and proactive policies is the need of the hour.

**The science behind AI: Neural Network**

A neural network is a **computer system designed to learn and recognize patterns**, like a simplified version of the human brain. It consists of layers of interconnected nodes or “**neurons**,” each of which performs a simple computation.

Neural networks have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their **ability to learn complex patterns and make accurate predictions**. They have been used in a variety of applications, including self-driving cars, speech recognition, and medical diagnosis.

### [Can the cheetahs help India’s grasslands?](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/10/can-the-cheetahs-help-indias-grasslands/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus:** **Environment, Conservation**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/can-the-cheetahs-help-indias-grasslands/article66599065.ece)

**Context:** Since September 2022, India has translocated eight African cheetahs from **Namibia** and 12 from **South Africa.**

**Background:**

- This is part of **a long-term conservation plan to re-introduce** the wild cat into the country after it became extinct in the **1950s**, primarily due to hunting.
- The aim is to build a **self-sustaining population**, centred at MP’s Kuno National Park, which will also contribute to the global survival of the cheetah as a species.

**What are Grasslands?**

Grasslands (e.g. prairies or savannas) are biomes characterized by vast expanses of grasses and a few scattered trees. They are found in regions where there is not enough rain to support forests but where there is enough rainfall to prevent the land from becoming a desert.

- Grasslands are typically located in the **interior regions of continents**, away from the moderating influence of oceans.
- Approximately **24 per cent**of total vegetation cover is grassland in India

**Can the cheetahs help India’s grasslands?**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Yes**|**No**|
|●       Cheetahs have been found in woodlands, **but they largely prefer running.**<br><br>●       They do indicate the **overall wellness of –**<br><br>○        **open areas**, meadows and grasslands and the<br><br>○        **ungulate populations** (deer and chinkara)/cheetahs’ usual prey<br><br>●       So, the health of the cheetah population does count as a **surrogate marker of the health of the grasslands.**<br><br>●       **The success story (The Project Tiger 1973) –** India now has 53 tiger reserves making up **2.3%** of the country’s geographical area.|●       Cheetahs may not help in restoring grasslands until India addresses other issues.<br><br>●       For example,<br><br>○        The **Wasteland Atlas of India** still categorises large stretches of open natural ecosystems as **wasteland**.<br><br>○        **Renewable energy projects** are granted large tracts of open natural ecosystems, to establish solar panels.<br><br>○        The level of human presence is high in these grasslands|

**Conclusion:** African cheetah is a species which has never been to India. Yet, its very introduction will enable India ‘if not wholly but in some measure’ revive its magnificent grasslands.

### **Zero-dose children**

 **Source:** [DTE](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/world/missed-vaccine-shots-go-for-innovative-strategies-to-address-zero-dose-say-experts-88146)

Children, esp. in developing and poor countries, miss out on important vaccine shots, also known as **zero-dose (**one in eight children was zero-dose — not received a vaccine of any kind )

**Strategies to address this problem:**

- **Involving Communities in immunization and awareness**: E.g. Using traditional systems such as community leaders, and local people from communities as immunisation vanguards and religious structures.
- **Using technology:**g. Zipline, a service that uses drones to deliver vaccines in flooded and hard-to-reach areas
- **Mobile vaccination clinics:** This strategy can help increase access to vaccines and reduce the burden of travel on families.
- **School-based vaccination programs**: This strategy can be particularly useful for adolescents who may be less likely to visit a healthcare provider regularly.
- **Text message reminders:** This strategy can help reduce missed appointments and increase vaccine uptake.
- **Social media campaigns**: Social media campaigns can help reach a wide audience and engage parents and caregivers in the vaccination process.

**Usage**: The strategies can be used as solutions in questions related to Health, Low Immunization, Vaccine resistance

**Factors behind the long sustenance of Cyclone Freddy:**

- **Global warming**: Absorption of human-induced greenhouse gases by the oceans, which increases their heat content, thus helping to strengthen cyclones.
- **Low horizontal wind shear favoured its rapid intensification**: Horizontal wind shear is the horizontal winds around a cyclone.
    - When these winds have lower speeds they help a cyclone grow in strength and when they have higher speeds they make it dissipate.
- **Warm sub-surface waters** helped the cyclone rapidly intensify multiple times
    - Usually, the sub-surface water is colder and when it gets pushed towards the surface due to mixing as a result of cyclonic winds, it creates conditions that don’t favour the intensification of cyclones

### **New appointments in the standing committee**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/new-appointments-in-standing-committee-were-made-after-consultations-jagdeep-dhankhar/article66600850.ece)**,** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/vice-president-jagdeep-dhankhar-personal-staff-house-committees-8485598/)

**Context:** Eight officers from the Vice President and Rajya Sabha Chairman’s personal staff have been attached to **12 standing committees and eight department-related standing committees** of Parliament, with the aim of assisting the committees in their work.

**Why is it being criticised?**

- **The order is violative of established parliamentary procedures**: Only MPs and staff of either the Rajya Sabha or Lok Sabha secretariats can offer such roles of assistance.
    - **The personal staff of the Speaker or the Chairman** are not part of parliamentary secretariats.
- **Not all the members** were consulted about the appointments

**RS Chairman’s defence**:

- The decision was made **after multi-layered consultations** with members and Chairmen of Committees to improve productivity.
- **The appointed staff will not function as members** and the appointments were made to provide **research-oriented, knowledgeable support** to optimize output and performance.

**About Parliament’s Committees:**

**A Parliamentary Committee** is a panel of MPs that are appointed or elected by the House or nominated by the Speaker/Chairman. They work under the direction of the Speaker/Chairman and present their report to them or to the House.

### **Australia-India education qualification recognition mechanism**

**Source**: [IE](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/indian-degrees-recognised-australia-8487675/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThis%20new%20mechanism%20means%20that,home%2C%E2%80%9D%20PM%20Albanese%20said.)

**Context**: The Australian Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, announced an “Australia-India education qualification recognition mechanism” during a visit to India.

**What does it mean?**

This new mechanism means that **degrees obtained in Australia (including online degrees) will now be recognised in India**, and similarly, Indian degrees will be recognized by Australian colleges and authorities.

- **Significance**: The agreement is expected to **make it easier for Indians to go to Australia** for both education and work, and vice-versa.
- **Exceptions**: Professional registrations of engineering, medicine and law graduates will remain outside the ambit of this agreement.

**Other similar agreement:** India has other agreements with countries like the **US**, however, the agreement with the US doesn’t include online courses

**Other announcements:**

**Geelong’s Deakin University** will be the first overseas university to open its branch campus in India (at GIFT City, Gandhi Nagar)

**‘Maitri’ scholarship**: It will provide financial assistance to Indian students in Australia for as long **as four years**.

- The scholarships are part of the wider **Maitri (friendship) programme** that seeks to boost cultural, educational and community ties between Australia and India

**Indian diaspora** in Australia numbers around 8,00,000

**Note**: We will cover India-Australia relations in detail after the visit of the Australian PM gets over.

### **Water on Earth**

 **Context:** Astronomers using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) have discovered gaseous water in the planet-forming disc around the star V883 Orionis.

**Significance of the discovery:**

- The study confirms the idea that the **water in planetary systems formed** billions of years ago, before the Sun, in interstellar space, and has been inherited by both comets and Earth, relatively unchanged.
- The discovery supports the idea that the **water on earth is even older than the Sun**.

**How did the Earth get its water?**

**Nearly 4 billion years ago**, during the **Late Heavy Bombardment**, countless meteors rained down on the Earth and the Moon. Over time, these icy asteroids and comets delivered oceans to Earth, depositing the water directly to the surface.

**About ALMA telescope:**

**The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA**) is an international partnership of the EU, USA, Japan, Canada, Taiwan, Korea and Chile. It is a single telescope (located on the **Chajnantor plateau, in northern Chile**) with the aim of unravelling important astronomical mysteries, in search of our **Cosmic Origins**
