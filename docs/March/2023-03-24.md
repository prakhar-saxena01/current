### [Parliamentary panel recommends new law to define power, functions of CBI](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/24/parliamentary-panel-recommends-new-law-to-define-power-functions-of-cbi/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Statutory, Regulatory and various Quasi-judicial Bodies**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/parliamentary-panel-recommends-new-law-to-define-power-functions-of-cbi/article66652681.ece)

 **Context:** According to a Parliamentary Committee, existing law governing the [Central Bureau of Investigation](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/04/02/220937/) (CBI) has many limitations and there is a need to enact new legislation to define its status, functions and powers.

**Background:**

- The CBI was established in **1963** (on the recommendation of the Santhanam Committee on Prevention of Corruption) and is governed by the **Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) Act, 1946**.
- According to the DSPE Act, **the consent of the State government is a prerequisite for any investigation by the CBI.**
- As of date, **9 States have withdrawn** [the general consent](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/10/23/general-consent-to-cbi/) and the recommendation of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Personnel, Public Grievances, Law and Justice came amid these withdrawals.

**Issues faced by the CBI:**

- **A caged parrot:** For instance, to prosecute any MLA/state minister, the CBI needs sanction from the Speaker of the state Assembly (for MLAs)/ the Governor (for state ministers).
    - Since all these sanctioning authorities have links to the ruling dispensation, Opposition parties feel they are unfairly targeted.
- **Structural constraints:** Both the legal structure and the changes made in the Rules governing CBI have hindered the functioning of the CBI.
- **Political tug-of-war:** Increasingly hostile relations between the Centre and the state governments (usually ruled by opposition parties).
- **Inadequate manpower:** 1,709 posts are vacant against its sanctioned strength of 7,295 → increasing pendency of cases, hampering the quality of investigation → impacting the **effectiveness and efficiency of the agency.**
- **Opaqueness:** The details of the cases and the annual report CBI is also not accessible to the general public.

**Efforts to reform the institution:**

- In the landmark **1997 Vineet Narain judgement**, the SC fixed the tenure of the CBI Director at **two years** to secure the autonomy of the CBI.
- The [Central Vigilance Commission](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/10/30/central-vigilance-commission/) (CVC) – supervision powers over CBI – has been given **statutory** status (CVC Act, 2003).
- [The Lokpal Act 2013](https://www.insightsonindia.com/governance/governance-important-aspects/transparency/lokpal/), laid down that the CBI Director should be chosen, unanimously or by majority vote, by a search committee headed by the PM (LoP, CJI as other members), from a Home Ministry-drawn list.
- However, **these reforms have been progressively diluted** by various governments over the years.
    - **For example,** the DSPE Act has been amended (2021) to give the government the power to extend the term of CBI director by one year – diluting autonomy.

**Recommendations of the parliamentary committee:**

- **A new law** (also recommended by the 2nd ARC) to define the status, functions and powers of the CBI → safeguards to ensure **objectivity and impartiality**.
- **Fill up vacancies at the earliest. The CBI director should monitor** the progress in this regard on a quarterly basis.
- **Reduce dependence on deputations** and strive to recruit **permanent staff** in the ranks of inspector of police and DSP.
- **Details of cases should be available in the public domain** → empower the citizens → make the functioning of CBI more accountable, responsible, efficient and transparent.
    - For this, **a case management system** which would be a centralised database should be considered.

### [India’s disputed compensatory afforestation policy at odds with new IPCC report](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/24/indias-disputed-compensatory-afforestation-policy-at-odds-with-new-ipcc-report/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Conservation, Environmental Pollution and Degradation, Environmental Impact Assessment**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/campa-fund-compensatory-afforestation-ipcc-synthesis-report/article66649373.ece)

 **Context:** India’s [compensatory afforestation](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/06/unused-funds-unsuitable-land-the-problems-with-compensatory-afforestation-in-india/) policy that allows forests in one part to be cut down and replaced with those elsewhere is contested on many grounds.

**Background:**

- Afforestation is part of India’s climate pledges – **adding a carbon sink of 2.5-3 GtCO2e through additional forest and tree cover by 2030**.
- According to [the Forest (Conservation) Act 1980](https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/environment-degradation-and-issues/forest-ecosystem/forest-policy-and-laws-for-forest-conservation/the-forest-conservation-act-1980/#:~:text=Enacted%20to%20check%20the%20indiscriminate,prescribing%20the%20punishment%20for%20violations.&text=Working%20plans%20should%20be%20up,have%20a%20multi%2Ddimensional%20approach.), the project proponent that wishes to divert the land must identify land elsewhere to afforest and pay for the afforestation exercise.
- Afforestation is also codified in the [Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/08/30/campa/) – a body created on the SC’s orders in 2002 and chaired by the Union Environment Minister.
- CAMPA is meant to **promote afforestation and regeneration activities** as a way of compensating for forest land diverted to non-forest uses (dam or mine).
- It was made a legal requirement through the **Compensatory Afforestation Fund (CAF) Act 2016.**

**Why is afforestation contested?**

- According to the Synthesis Report of the IPCC, the **preservation of natural ecosystems** rather than restoring the destroyed ones is being recognised as an important means to mitigate climate change.
- According to the **CAG report (2013),** most of the money (~Rs 47,000 crore in 2019) in the CAMPA fund had been **unspent**.
- CAMPA has also come under fire for **facilitating the destruction of natural ecosystems** → adversely impacting livelihood, biodiversity, hydrology and the climate.
- **Planting non-native species** or artificial plantations wouldn’t compensate for the ecosystem loss as well be hazardous to the existing ecosystem.
- **For example,** the Haryana govt is planning to develop the world’s largest curated safari using CAMPA funds received from deforestation in Great Nicobar.

**Significance of the natural ecosystems:** Provides biodiversity, local livelihoods, hydrological services and sequester carbon.

**Recommendations:** Renewable energy projects like **wind and solar plants** must be promoted to mitigate the adverse impacts of natural ecosystem diversion.

**Challenges for India:**

- Many solar parks in India have **triggered conflicts with people living nearby**.
- Wind farms in the Western Ghats had **reduced the abundance and activity of predatory birds**, which consequently increased the density of lizards.

**Conclusion:**

- **Climate actions**, such as technologies to combat climate change, renewable energy farms, etc. **should not come at the cost of natural ecosystems.**
- **Not degrading existing ecosystems in the first place** will do more to lower the impact of the climate crisis than restoring ecosystems that have been destroyed.

### **Story on Happiness**

**A sage named Narada** travels to find the happiest person in the world but fails to find one until he meets a poor farmer who is always content and happy despite his poverty.

**Narada** asked him to teach him how to be happy like him. The farmer then gave Narada a **small bag of rice** and told him to carry it on his back and walk around the village. Narada was confused but followed the farmer’s instructions. But the more he walked, the **heavier the bag of rice became.** Narada soon realized that the bag was becoming a burden, and he was starting to feel tired and unhappy. He went back to the farmer and told him about his experience. The farmer smiled and said, “**Happiness is not about what you have or what you do. It’s about how you carry your burdens**.”

Narada understood the lesson and **realized that happiness is not something that can be found outside of oneself.** It comes from **within, from having faith, gratitude, and contentment, no matter** what one’s circumstances may be.

**Usage**: The example can be used in Essay paper on themes related to Happiness

### **Shaheed Diwas**

 **Source:** [IE](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/bhagat-singh-jawaharlal-nehru-8515080/)

**Shaheed Diwas** is observed on **23rd March every year** to pay tribute to the sacrifice of **Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, and Rajguru** who were executed by the British government in **1931 for** mistakenly **assassinating a British police officer, John Saunders** (although their target was British police superintendent, **James Scott**—who was involved in the death of Lala Lajpat Rai)

- The day is also known as **Sarvodaya Day or Martyrs’ Day**.
- It is different from the **Martyrs’ Day observed on 30th January**, which commemorates the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Ethical Lesson**|**Examples from Bhagat Singh’s Life**|
|**Patriotism**|Bhagat Singh believed in the idea of **an independent, socialist India**, and was willing to sacrifice his life for the cause.|
|**Courage**|He and his associates carried out a **bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi** to protest against the repressive British regime, and then courted arrest by shouting slogans.|
|**Selflessness**|Bhagat Singh **refused to accept the offer of a job** from a wealthy family in order to stay true to his revolutionary ideals.|
|**Justice and Fairness**|He went on a hunger strike in jail to **protest the inhumane treatment of prisoners**, and to draw attention to the cause of Indian independence.|
|**Integrity**|When he was **offered a deal by the British government** to save his life in exchange for renouncing his revolutionary ideals, he refused to accept it.|

 **Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/what-is-the-lily-thomas-rahul-gandhi-8515037/)

 **Context:** A Surat court sentenced Congress leader (Rahul Gandhi) to two years in jail in a 2019 defamation case and also granted him bail and suspended his sentence for 30 days to allow him to appeal.

**Background:**

- As per **Section 8(3) of the Representation of the People Act 1951**, conviction of a lawmaker for an offence with a two-year sentence or more leads to disqualification from the House.
- As per **Section 8(4)** of the RPA the disqualification takes effect only after three months have elapsed from the date of conviction.
    - Within that period, the convicted lawmaker could have filed an appeal against the sentence before a higher court.
- However, this provision was struck down as “**unconstitutional**” in the SC’s landmark **2013** ruling in ‘**Lily Thomas v Union of India**’.

**Options available after conviction:**

- Get his conviction stayed by a higher court.
- Approaching the President. As per **Article 103** of the Constitution, the disqualification case of an MP will be decided by the President in consultation with the Election Commission.

### **Patent monopoly/evergreening**

 **Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/india-rejects-johnson-johnsons-attempt-to-extend-monopoly-on-lifesaving-tb-drug/article66654219.ece)

 **Context:** India rejects Johnson & Johnson’s attempt to extend monopoly on lifesaving TB drug – Bedaquiline.

**Background:**

- **Bedaquiline** is a crucial drug in the treatment of **multi-drug resistant TB patients** for whom the first-line drug treatment (Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol) has stopped working.
- Over 55,000 patients benefited from access to Bedaquiline in India in 2019.
- When J&J filed for evergreening of its patent on fumarate salt (a formulation of Bedaquiline), its patent evergreening practice was challenged by two TB survivors in 2019.

**Why is Patent Monopoly/Evergreening?**

- It is a practice of **modifying drugs** (without improving efficacy) in order to extend their patent life and profitability.
- Evergreening → establishes monopoly → undermines competition.
- **The Indian Patents Act, 1970** prohibits the mischievous practice of evergreening of patents → making the drugs **affordable** and promoting domestic **generic drug markers**.

**Indian Patent Office’s order in the J&J case:**

- The claimed invention is not patentable since it was obvious and **lacked an innovative step** mandated under Section 3(e) of the Patents Act.
- According to Patents Act Section 3(d), **derivatives of well-known compounds and salt forms are not patentable.**

### **Candida auris**

 **Source:** [**BBC**](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65055878) 

**Context:** An emerging fungus called _Candida auris_ is spreading rapidly and geographically, according to a warning from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

**About Candida auris:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Feature**|**Information**|
|**Type of organism**|Yeast-type fungus|
|**Discovery**|First **discovered in 2009 in the ear canal** of a patient at the Tokyo Hospital (**_auris_** is Latin for the ear).)|
|**Infections**|Can cause **bloodstream infections, respiratory infections, central nervous system** and organ infections, and skin infections|
|**Mortality rate**|Estimated to be between **30% to 53%** of patients affected by an invasive infection|
|**Drug resistance**|Resistant to the **most common types of antifungal drugs** and some strains are resistant to all medicines|
|**Spread**|Transmission is mainly through **contaminated surfaces in hospitals,** and can easily spread leading to outbreaks|
|**Risk factors**|Higher risk in hospital settings, nursing homes, and for patients in intensive care. Also, **those who have been on antibiotics for a long time have a higher risk**|
|**Difficulty in identification**|Identifying a C. auris infection is **quite difficult and it can easily be mistaken for other fungi, leading to the wrong treatment**|
|**C. auris is usually harmless**|Most of the time, **Candida yeasts live on our skin without causing problems**, but they can cause infections if we are unwell or they get into the wrong place, like the bloodstream or the lungs.|
|**Potential cause for rising infections**|**Rising temperatures linked to climate change** may have played a role in the rising number of infections|
|**Other superbug fungi on the WHO priority watchlist**|**Cryptococcus neoformans** ( it lives in the environment (soil, decaying wood)), **Aspergillus fumigatus** (environmental mould) and **Candida albicans** (commonly found in human microbiota (mouth, throat, gut, vagina, and skin))|

### **Desalination—a viable solution to water scarcity**

**Source**: [IE](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/is-ocean-viable-solution-for-water-scarcity-8514631/)

**Context**: While around **70% of Earth’s surface is covered with water**, **less than 1% per cent is drinkable**. The desalination of our oceans into drinking water has emerged as the ultimate means to drought-proof regions suffering from water poverty

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Aspects of Desalination**|**Description**|
|**Definition**|A process of **removing salt and other minerals from seawater** or brackish water to make it potable for human consumption|
|**Techniques**|**Thermal distillation** or **reverse osmosis membrane** (uses the principle of osmosis to remove salt and other impurities, by transferring water through a series of semi-permeable membranes)|
|**Global Usage**|Over 20,000 desalination plants operating in over 170 countries, with the largest in Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Israel|
|**Examples**|**Minjur Desalination Plant in Chennai** ( using reverse osmosis, largest water desalination plant in India). Also, the **Chennai-based National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT)** will set up a Desalination plant in **Lakshadweep**|
|**Environmental impact**|Desalination is **highly energy-intensive and can have significant greenhouse gas emissions,** and generate **toxic brine effluent (concentrated salt water)** that impacts marine ecosystems|
|**Sustainable solutions**|**Renewable energy** can be used to power desalination plants for a more sustainable solution|
|**Alternative to RO Desalination Technology**|**Low-temperature Thermal Desalination (LTTD)** – It works on the principle that water in the ocean 1,000 or 2,000 feet below is about 40 C to 80 C colder than surface water.<br><br>E.g. **100,000 litre-a-day plant** in **Kavaratti** (Lakshadweep islands) based on LTTD is operational|
|**Cost**|The cost of desalination has decreased from around $5 per cubic meter in the 2000s to 50 cents today|
|**Future outlook**|Desalination may become a **more important means of ensuring water security** in regions suffering from water scarcity and climate change impacts|
