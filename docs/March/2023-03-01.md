#### **GS Paper 2**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/punchhi-panel-work-centre-state-views-8472376/)

  **Context**: Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has decided to start the process of seeking the states’ comments on the issue afresh.

**What is Punchhi Commission Report?**

The Punchhi Commission was constituted in **2007** under the chairmanship of former Chief **Justice of India Madan Mohan Punchhi**. In 2010, the Commission submitted its report to the Centre in **seven volumes**.

- Deliberation on the report was carried out by [**Inter-State Council**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/functions-and-responsibilities-of-the-union-and-the-states-issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure-devolution-of-powers-and-finances-up-to-local-levels-and-challenges-therein/issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure/inter-state-relations/inter-state-councils/#:~:text=Limitations%20of%20the%20council%3A&text=The%20Inter%2Dstate%20council%20is,establishment%20of%20such%20a%20council) **(ISC’s) Standing Committee** in 2017 and 2018.
- However, **the report is yet to be implemented** and the government has said that it will seek the state’s view on the report again.

**The objective of the commission**: [To examine and review the operation of the current agreements between the Union and States.](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/functions-and-responsibilities-of-the-union-and-the-states-issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure-devolution-of-powers-and-finances-up-to-local-levels-and-challenges-therein/issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure/centre-state-relations/recent-trends/)

**Conclusion**

Although some of the ideas of the commission have been put into practice, such as having the **governor come from outside the state**, there is a need for further deliberations and give concrete forms of useful recommendations as per current needs.

### [India should stick to the middle path in the new world disorder](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/01/india-should-stick-to-the-middle-path-in-the-new-world-disorder/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **International Relations**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/the-middle-path-for-india-in-the-new-world-disorder/article65479476.ece)

**Context:** India should follow a **path of** [multi-engagement](https://www.financialexpress.com/world-news/indias-policy-of-multi-engagement-and-the-brics/2133842/) and **not multi-alignment**.

**Background:**

- **India has consistently resisted international pressure** to criticise Russia and its actions.
- For example, India has once again **abstained from voting** on a UN General Assembly resolution that condemns [Russia’s invasion of Ukraine](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/11/11/could-india-be-a-mediator-between-russia-and-ukraine/).

**The global order in international relations:**

- **After the end of the 2nd World War:** A **bipolar** world, led by the U.S. and the Soviet Union, emerged.
- **Following the disintegration of the Soviet Union (1991): Unipolarity replaced bipolarity**, with the U.S. being its centre.
- However, there have been discussions about whether American unipolarity has passed and a **new world order** (multipolar) **has emerged.**

**Signs of the new world order:**

- China’s rapid rise
- Russia’s aggressive foreign policy – the invasion of Ukraine, **challenged the post-Cold War security equilibrium** in Europe.
- The **S.’s ability to shape geopolitical outcomes is clearly in decline** (withdrawal from Afghanistan).

**Impact of this transition (from uni to multipolarity):**

- **Leaving the world in flux**. Lack of clarity on which direction the world is headed makes **policy-making harder for middle powers like India.**
- While many governments (including India, Russia and China), welcome multipolarity, **the U.S. remains the world’s most powerful military power.**

 **India and the** [Non-alignment](https://www.insightsonindia.com/international-relations/important-international-institutions-agencies-and-further-structure-mandate-etc/nam-and-its-relevance/) **success:**

- When India became independent, **the Cold War** was in its early stages.
- India’s [non-alignment foreign policy doctrine](https://www.insightsonindia.com/international-relations/important-international-institutions-agencies-and-further-structure-mandate-etc/nam-and-its-relevance/) (equidistant from both blocs) did well in managing most of its (ideological and geopolitical) challenges.
- Criticised as **too idealistic**, India has actually been **flexible** in readapting itself to the changes in the global and regional equations.
- In the 1970s, after China started moving closer to the U.S., **India started tilting towards the Soviet Union** but stayed out of any Soviet-led military alliances.
- **When the Soviet Union collapsed**, India sought to transform its ties with the U.S. and integrate itself with the global economy in the new era of globalisation.
- But it also maintained clos**e defence and strategic ties with Russia** and built a **vibrant economic partnership with China.**

**A new set of challenges for India in the new global disorder:**

- [S.-China’s great power contest in Asia](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/10/19/editorial-analysis-india-america-and-the-china-challenge/) is unfolding right in India’s neighbourhood.
- **The power imbalance** between India and China, tempted India to join the American bloc.
- **Abandoning its strategic autonomy** and joining the U.S.-led bloc would limit India’s options, besides provoking China.
- [Border disputes between India and China](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/05/12/india-china-border-dispute/).
- China has developed **a strategic partnership with Pakistan** and is raising its influence in other South Asian and Indian Ocean countries.
- So, on all fronts (including challenges to India’s maritime influence), India faces the heat of China’s rise.

**Other challenges faced by India:** U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and the Taliban’s return to power.

**How Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has complicated the situation for India?**

- [Russia is a traditional partner with which India](https://www.insightsonindia.com/international-relations/bilateral-regional-and-global-groupings-and-agreements-involving-india-and-or-affecting-indias-interests/india-and-other-nations/india-russia-relations/) has deep defence ties.
- As the West has moved to isolate Russia with heavy sanctions, India is under huge pressure **to take a more critical position on Russia’s actions**.
- The West’s move to isolate Russia in Europe would **push the country further into the Chinese embrace.**

**Way ahead for India:**

- **Learning from China**. In the 1970s, China broke away from the Soviet communist fold and built **a quasi-alliance with the U.S. and helped the ‘imperialist bloc’ defeat the Soviet communists.**
    - Once China acquired enough economic and military power, it started gradually challenging the U.S.
- Therefore, India’s primary focus should be on **transforming itself economically and militarily,** bridging the gap with China.
- India should present itself as **a natural stabilising power** in South Asia and the Indian Ocean Region, and **a source of prosperity.**
- To address its continental security challenges, **India has to work with Eurasian powers such as Russia and Iran**, both of which are at odds with the U.S.

**Conclusion: India should opt for multi-engagement** (not multi-alignment) **for a multipolar world**, creating new pillars of the new global order through engagement and partnership with middle powers.

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Conservation, Environmental Pollution and Degradation**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/fossil-fuels-companies-failed-methane-emission-iea-8471708/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20International%20Energy,record%20highs%20seen%20in%202019.)

 **Context:** The [International Energy Agency (IEA](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/04/16/international-energy-agency-iea/)) released the annual **Methane Global Tracker report in 2023.**

**Background:** The report has come after energy giants (Shell, BP, ExxonMobil) reported record profits last year as the [Russia-Ukraine war](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/11/editorial-analysis-lessons-from-russias-ukraine-war/) **drove up oil and natural gas prices.**

**Findings of the report:**

- **The energy sector** accounts for around **40%** of the total average methane emissions from human activity.
- **Oil and natural gas companies** are known to release methane into the atmosphere when natural gas is flared or vented.
- It is also released through **leaks** from valves and other equipment during the drilling, extraction and transportation process.
- **Fossil fuel companies** emitted 120 million metric tonnes of methane into the atmosphere in 2022 and have done nothing to find and fix leaking infrastructure.

**Recommendations in the report:**

- Methane cuts (by 75%) from the energy sector are among the **cheapest options to limit near-term global warming** (lower global temperature rise by nearly 0.1 degree Celsius by mid-century).
- **Reducing wastage** by measures such as leak detection, repair and upgrading leaky equipment would cost **less than 3% of the net income** received by the oil and gas industry in 2022.
- Methane emissions can be reduced with the help of the **right policies and implementation and cheap and readily available technology**.

###  [Revisiting two cases of medico deaths](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/01/revisiting-two-cases-of-medico-deaths/)

#### **GS Paper 4**

**Syllabus:** Ethics: Role of family, society and educational institutions in inculcating values

**Source:** [**The Hindu**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/revisiting-two-cases-of-medico-deaths/article66562792.ece)

 **Context:** A first-year postgraduate medical student at the **Kakatiya Medical College Dr Preethi was** **reportedly harassed by a male senior**, following which she tried to end her life.

**About Ragging:**

Ragging, also known as hazing refers to the **practice of subjecting new students to humiliating or abusive behaviour as a way of initiating them into a group or community**.

- Ragging can take many forms, including **physical and emotional abuse, harassment, bullying, and even sexual assault**.
- Apart from **ragging, hazing, fagging, bullying, pledging and horseplaying** are different terms.

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ragging.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ragging.png)**

**Previous instances of ragging in India:**

  **TAMIL NADU – PON NAVARASU**

- Tamil Nadu **passed the country’s first anti-ragging legislation in 1997 based on the Pon Navarasu case.**
- Navarasu, son of the-**then vice-chancellor of the University of Madras**, was murdered. John David, a senior student of his college, **confessed to the crime days later and surrendered to judicial custody.**
- During a ragging session, Navarasu was **assaulted, and forced to strip and lick David’s footwear,** he **was violently beaten up and killed when he refused to do so**.

 **MAHARASHTRA – Payal Tadvi**

- Payal Tadvi, a second-year MD student at Mumbai’s TN Topivala National Medical College (TNMC), had spoken to her friends about **caste discrimination and harassment within the campus.** 
- She belonged to the Adivasi Tadvi Bhil community and was found dead in Mumbai.

**Data on caste discrimination in colleges:**

- A parliamentary panel found rampant caste bias within All **India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS),** as MBBS students from **Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes failed repeatedly in their exams.** 
- The examiners tend to ask the **name of the students and try to judge/ know if a student belongs to SC/ST community.**

**Laws against ragging in India:**

- Indian Penal Code
- UGC Regulations on Curbing the Menace of Ragging in Higher Educational Institutions, 2009
- Other institute-specific regulations

**Ethical issues associated with ragging:**

- Violation of **human dignity**
- Infringement of **individual rights**
- Promotion of **unhealthy behaviour**
- **Compromise of academic** standards
- **The legal and moral responsibility** of educational institutions

**Solutions:**

- Strict rules and regulations
- Awareness campaigns
- Counselling and support

In Rajasthan’s Barmer district, there has been a surge in cases of **women allegedly jumping to their deaths with their children in tanks and wells following marital disputes**.

In response, the **district administration, UNICEF, and Action Aid** have launched the **‘Anmol Jeevan Abhiyan’ (Precious Life Campaign)**, which encourages the addition of **hand pumps and locked covers** to the large tanks or ‘tankas’ traditionally built for collecting rainwater in the rural areas.

- The hand pumps serve a **dual purpose of preventing accidents and suicides** while also providing water.
- The closure of the tankas with locked covers **reduces the accessibility and prompts those with suicidal tendencies** to have second thoughts.
- **A round-the-clock helpline** has been established on the District Collectorate premises
- **The ‘Har Din Hai Man Ka Din’ awareness** programme has been introduced in schools.

**Impact**: The campaign has already **equipped 130 tankas** in one panchayat area with hand pumps, and the **reports of suicides have gradually reduced**.

**Usage of the example:** In governance/Ethics/Essay as a unique initiative to reduce the case of suicide, isolation among women, simple innovation to solve social issues, easy access to water, and foster relationships within families.

### **The powers of Governors regarding assembly sessions**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/punjab-govt-supreme-court-governor-purohit-budget-session-explained-8470995/)

 **Context:** The Solicitor General told the SC that the Punjab Governor had summoned the state Assembly for a budget session.

**Background:**

- This came minutes before the SC was set to hear a challenge by the Punjab government against the [Governor](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/functions-and-responsibilities-of-the-union-and-the-states-issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure-devolution-of-powers-and-finances-up-to-local-levels-and-challenges-therein/issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure/governors-role/), **over his refusal to summon the Budget session** of Vidhan Sabha.
- The Governor had cited [Article 167](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/03/12/insights-into-editorial-the-office-of-the-governor/) **of the Constitution**, which relates to the duties of the Chief Minister in furnishing information to the Governor.

**Can the Governor refuse to summon the assembly?**

- **Article 163(1)** of the Indian Constitution says that there shall be a council of Ministers with the Chief Minister at the head **to aid and advise the Governor in the exercise of his functions.**
    - However, **except** in cases where s/he is required under this constitution to exercise his/her **discretion**.
- **Under Article 174**, a Governor shall summon the House at a time and place, as s/he thinks fit.
    - **Article 174 (2) (a)** says a Governor may from “time to time” prorogue the House and **174 (2) (b)** allows her or him to dissolve the Legislative Assembly.
- A joint reading of the two provisions leaves the Governor with **minimal discretion** in summoning the house. **For example,** when the CM has lost the support of the House and his strength is debatable.
- In 2016, the SC (in Nabam Rebia case) held that **the power to summon the House is not solely vested in the Governor.**

 **Source:** [**The Hindu**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/legislator-facing-disqualification-cant-attend-floor-test-supreme-court/article66564901.ece)

 **Context: According to the Chief Justice of India – a**llowing an MP or an MLA who is facing disqualification under the [anti-defection law](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/04/25/anti-defection-law-5/) to participate in a [floor test](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/03/14/what-is-a-floor-test-or-trust-vote/) caused by his own doings will defeat the very purpose of the [Tenth Schedule](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/06/17/10th-schedule-of-the-constitution-5/).

 **About Anti-Defection Law:**

- Introduced through the **52nd Amendment Act of 1985 –** inserted in the **Tenth Schedule of the Indian Constitution.**

### **How price signals guide the allocation of goods**

**Source:** [**The Hindu**](https://www.thehindu.com/specials/text-and-context/how-price-signals-guide-the-allocation-of-goods/article66565090.ece#:~:text=Price%20signal%20refers%20to,for%20these%20goods%20among%20consumers.)

 **About Price Signal:**

- Price signal refers to the **information that prices convey to both producers and consumers in a** [**market economy**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-economy-3/introduction-to-economics/different-types-of-economic-systems/). In particular, prices signal the **relative scarcity of different goods in an economy** when measured against the competing demands for these goods among consumers.
    - Prices in a way **coordinate the production and distribution of goods and services** across the modern economy. This allocation of resources in large economies happens despite the absence of a central planner to direct the allocation.

 **For example:**

When the **price of water is high due to its limited supply in the market,** consumers will have a greater incentive to use water more sparingly. Water producers, on the other hand, will have a greater incentive to **bring more water into the market; this is because the high price of water offers them an opportunity to earn higher profits.**
