### [What California’s atmospheric rivers mean for drought, floods, fires](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/23/what-californias-atmospheric-rivers-mean-for-drought-floods-fires/)

#### **GS Paper 1**

**Source:** [Indian Express](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/california-atmospheric-rivers-drought-floods-fires-8511428/)

**Context**: California has experienced an exceptionally **wet winter with 11 atmospheric rivers battering the state** and a twelfth such storm **threatening to cause even more flooding, landslides and road closures.**

- California has received **147% of average rainfall** so far this season, **according to the state Department of Water Resources.**

**About** [Atmospheric rivers](https://www.noaa.gov/stories/what-are-atmospheric-rivers)**:**

- Atmospheric rivers are **vast airborne currents of dense moisture carried aloft for hundreds of miles from the Ocean** and funnelled over **land to fall as bouts of heavy rain and snow.**

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/atmostpheric-river.jpg?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/atmostpheric-river.jpg)**

**California prone to drought:**

- During any **normal 20-year period of the 20th century, about 10 years were wet and 10 years were dry.**
- But in the past 25 years, **only nine years were wet and 16 were dry**, meaning the state needs seven more wet years to recover. And **climate change points to future years that are likely to get warmer, exacerbating the increasingly dry climate.**

**How does the rain affect wildfires?**

- This winter’s bountiful rainfall has already **triggered considerable growth in grasses and scrub that will dry out by summer, leaving a larger, thicker fuel bed for wildfires.**
- The heavy rains can create **dangers around burn scars from previous wildfires**. The denuded land becomes susceptible to mudslides.

**Impacts on regional climate and people:**

- **Heat balance**: They transport huge amounts of water vapour from one place to another which is essential for the transfer of heat and equalizing heat across various latitudes.
- **Precipitation**
- **Climate change**: They are being amplified by global warming as they are predicted to grow longer, wetter and wider in a warming climate.
- **People**:
    - **Pros**: In dry conditions, atmospheric rivers can replenish water supplies and quench dangerous wildfires.

They can also deliver the usually needed rainfall to a region which is necessary for human life.

- **Cons**: In wet conditions, they can cause damaging floods and debris flow, wreaking havoc on local economies.
- **Visibility** is also diminished as these rivers increase haze-fog conditions which harm agriculture and transport.

### [On the higher judiciary’s move on the death penalty](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/23/on-the-higher-judiciarys-move-on-the-death-penalty/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Source:** [The Hindu](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/abolition-is-the-way-the-hindu-editorial-on-the-higher-judiciarys-move-on-the-death-penalty/article66649608.ece)

**Context**: The Supreme Court asked the Centre to **provide data that may point to a more dignified,** **less painful and socially acceptable** method of executing prisoners other than death by hanging.

- The Bench has sought **fresh data to substantiate the argument that a more humane means of execution can be found.**

**Death penalty:**

- [The death penalty](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/06/04/insights-editorial-analysis-the-challenge-of-reforming-death-penalty/), **also known as capital punishment**, is a legal sentence in some countries where a **person is put to death by the state as a punishment for a crime they have committed.**
- **Section 354 (5) of the Code of Criminal Procedure** mandates that a person sentenced to death shall **“be hanged by the neck till he is dead”.**

**Table: Pros and Cons of the Death Penalty**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Pros**|**Cons**|
|Deterrent to crime|Violation of human rights|
|Provides justice for victims and families|Risk of executing innocent people|
|Appropriate punishment for heinous crimes|Irreversible|
|Reduces prison overcrowding and expenses|Discriminatory against marginalized communities|
|Closure for victims and families|The fallibility of the justice system|
|Vengeance for the victims and families|Potential for wrongful convictions and biases|
|Supported by a majority of the public|Can be expensive and time-consuming to execute|

**Judgements related to death sentences:**

- There are two leading judgments on the issue — **Bachan Singh vs the State of Punjab (1980), which upheld the death penalty,** but limited it to the ‘rarest of rare cases’, and
- **Deena Dayal vs Union of India and Others (1983), upheld the method** by ruling that **hanging is “as painless as possible” and “causes no greater pain than any other known method”.**
- The **35th Report of the Law Commission (1967)** noted that **electrocution, the use of a gas chamber and lethal injection** were considered by some to be less painful.

**Centre’s stand on death by hanging:**

- In its 2018 affidavit, the government argued that **death by hanging was the only “viable” option to execute a death warrant**. However, the **government also sought additional time to examine the methods followed in other countries.**

**What is the practice in other countries?**

- According to Amnesty International**, 55 countries around the world have the death sentence on the books**.
- In the United States, an i**ntravenous lethal injection is given in every state (27 states and American Samoa) that allows the death penalty.** Electrocution is a secondary method in some states.
- **Execution by firing squad is employed in China and Saudi Arabia** uses beheading apart from other methods.

### [India’s democratic values have eroded significantly](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/23/indias-democratic-values-have-eroded-significantly/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus:** **Functioning of Indian Democracy**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/data/data-indias-democratic-values-have-eroded-significantly-v%C2%ADdem/article66644673.ece)

**Context:** The question of whether or not India’s democratic values have declined in recent years has been debated at the University of Cambridge.

**Data on democratic values in India**: By the Sweden-based V-Dem (Varieties of Democracy) Institute –

- **The deliberative democracy index:** It measures whether political decisions are made through public reasoning or emotional appeals and coercion.
- **The egalitarian democracy index:** It examines equal access to rights and liberties.
- **The electoral democracy index:** It evaluates election cleanliness and lack of fraud.
- **The liberal democracy index:** It measures the protection of individual and minority rights against state tyranny.
- **The participatory democracy index:** It measures active citizen engagement in electoral and non-electoral political processes.
- The values of these indexes have been declining, and **in 2022 they reached the levels last seen during the 1975 Emergency.**

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/demo_index.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/demo_index.png)**

**Some incidents depicting declining democratic values in India:**

- The arrest of citizens for posting online content critical of the government.
- The shutdown of domestic access to the Internet.
- The government **censored** political information on the Internet.
- Allegations of the government using **social media to disseminate misleading/false information** to influence the population.
- Harassment of journalists.

### [UN World Water Development Report 2023](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/23/un-world-water-development-report-2023/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus: Agriculture/Geography**

**Source:** [**UNWater**](https://www.unwater.org/publications/un-world-water-development-report-2023)**,** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/water/world-water-day-2023-dharwad-revived-traditional-ponds-to-recharge-its-groundwater-88377)

 **Context: Recently,** [**‘United Nations World Water Development Report 2023: partnerships and cooperation for water’**](https://www.unesco.org/reports/wwdr/2023/en), was released. Also, UN 2023 Water Conference is currently being held in New York

**Major findings of the report:**

- **Global:**
    - Globally, two billion people do not have safe drinking water and 3.6 billion lack access to safely managed sanitation
    - **The global urban population facing water scarcity** is projected to increase from **one-third (2016) to nearly half** of the global urban population in 2050, with India projected to be the most severely affected.
- **India:**
    - **80% of people living under water stress** lived in Asia; in particular, northeast China, as well as India and Pakistan.

**Recommendations:**

- **Smart management and conservation** of the world’s water resources means bringing together governments, businesses, scientists, civil society and communities – including indigenous communities – to design and deliver concrete solutions.”
- **Water-energy-food nexus** is critical in a transboundary context E.g. transboundary water cooperation arrangement established by the **Mahakali Treaty (Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project)** between [India and Nepal](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/06/editorial-analysis-stabilizing-ties-with-nepal-in-uncertain-times/), which aims to achieve water and energy security for both parties.
- Partnerships that focus on **knowledge co-creation instead of knowledge transfer** aim to embrace the diversity of expertise and experience within a knowledge system.
- Water resources management practices should incorporate traditional elements: E.g. **paar systems in western Rajasthan, India, and amunas** in Peru
- **Use of technology:**g., Google began a **flood forecasting initiative** in 2018, with the goal of preventing catastrophic damage

**Terms related to water:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Terms used**|**Definition**|
|**Water scarcity**|Lack of sufficient available water resources to meet water usage demands within a region|
|**Water stress**|The difficulty of obtaining fresh water sources during a period of time may lead to further depletion and deterioration of available water|
|**Water shortage/deficits**|Shortages of water caused by climate change, pollution, increased human demand, and overuse of water|
|**Water crisis**|A situation where the available potable, unpolluted water within a region is less than that region’s demand|

**Other steps to conserve Water:**

- **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Goal 6** includes a specific goal on water and sanitation (Goal 6)
- **UN-mandated** [**Paris Agreement**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/07/08/financial-and-technological-commitments-under-unfccc-and-paris-agreement/) recognizes the interlinkages between water and climate change.
- **Dublin Principles** water was established as an “**economic good”**

**About the Report:**

The WWDR is published by UNESCO on behalf of UN-Water and its production is coordinated by the UNESCO World Water Assessment Programme. It is an annual report released on Launched on [World Water Day (22nd March)](https://www.worldwaterday.org/) every year

**About the UN 2023 Water Conference (New York from March 22-24, 2023)**

It will be the second UN Conference dedicated to water after the one held in **Mar del Plata**, Argentina, in 1977. UN has launched a global campaign called **‘Be the Change’** to mark World Water Day 2023.

We will cover its outcome once the conference gets over.

**Jal Jeevan Mission**

- The [Jal Jeevan Mission](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/10/04/jal-jeevan-mission-jjm-3/) aims to **deliver safe and enough drinking water** to all rural Indian households by 2024 through individual household tap connections.
- It is the Ministry of **Jal Shakti’s main programme**
- It started in **2019**
- **Focus:** Community-based approach to water, with comprehensive information, education, and communication as a fundamental component of the goal.

### [The stage has been set for gender equity in Digital India](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/23/the-stage-has-been-set-for-gender-equity-in-digital-india/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus:** **Government Policies and Interventions for Development in various sectors and Issues arising out of their Design and Implementation**

**Source:** [**LM**](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/the-stage-has-been-set-for-gender-equity-in-digital-india-11679423093491.html)

**Context:** Addressing [India’s digital gender divide](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Impact-of-Digital-Economy-on-Women-in-India.pdf) will enable the Indian economy to achieve more inclusive growth in the long term.

**Data related to India’s digital gender divide:**

- **National Family Health Survey (2019-21):** One in three women in India (33%) have ever used the internet, compared to more than half (57%) of men [Rural India – 49% vs 25%].

**Gendered barriers that need to be addressed:**

**Lack of access:** Low levels of infrastructure, coverage and smartphone penetration → gender inequality → low access to digital devices and services.

- **Solution: Bridging the access gap** (especially in rural areas) by
    - Enabling smartphone and internet access through wider connectivity and penetration in rural areas,
    - Providing affordable solutions and educating households on the benefits of digital access.

**Digital illiteracy:** Inequality in functional literacy → Overall 59% (66% in rural areas) of women between 15-49 years have not completed 10 or more years of schooling → **often cannot make optimum use of smartphones**.

- **Solution:** Digital education would help this large cohort leapfrog the traditional development gender divide.

**Cyber safety and security:** Women may be **more vulnerable to online harassment, cyberbullying and cyberstalking** → which in turn widens the digital divide.

**Areas that can play a catalytic role in bridging the gender digital divide:**

- **Designing digital solutions to advance gender equity:** The involvement of girls and women in co-creation will accelerate digital adoption and help reduce the digital gender divide.
- **Digital literacy and capacity building:** Early access to digital technology to absorb new knowledge and skills → essential for employability → higher earning, and economic opportunities.
- **Responsible technology:** Protecting user privacy and data must be a top priority → stakeholders in the technology industry and the government need to collaborate.

**The Indian government’s Initiatives in this direction:**

- [PM Gramin Digital Saksharta Abhiyan](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2017/02/14/air-spotlight-summary-pradhan-mantri-gramin-digital-saksharta-abhiyan/) under the vision of Digital India. It specifically targets the rural population, with 60 million households covered.
- [The National Digital Library](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/08/28/national-digital-library-of-india/) for children and adolescents proposed in the UB for 2023-24 will ensure equitable access to quality education and improve digital literacy levels.
- **The ‘Stay Safe Online’ campaign** by MeitY, conceptualised as part of [India’s G20 presidency](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/07/editorial-analysis-indias-g20-presidency/), will prioritize awareness creation.

**Way ahead:** India is home to the **largest number of women** (~691 million) **in the world** → opportunities for women to contribute, participate and innovate in this ever-expanding and dynamic digital ethos.

**Conclusion:**

- With its position at the G20’s helm and drive towards a trillion-dollar-plus digital economy, the country has its building blocks in place to be **at the forefront of the next digital revolution.**
- With the stage for a **transformative** [and gender-equal digital revolution](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/08/the-importance-of-women-led-digital-solutions/) been set, India must take advantage of the mutually reinforcing forces of socioeconomic and digital empowerment.

### [The road to ending tuberculosis](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/23/the-road-to-ending-tuberculosis/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus:** **Issues Relating to Development and Management of Social Sector/Services relating to Health**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/the-road-to-ending-tuberculosis/article66649256.ece)

**Context:** The existing target of **ending tuberculosis (TB) by 2030** lacks implementation and clarity about definitions of “end”.

**Background:**

- In **1993**, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared TB a global health emergency.
- Founded in 2001, **the Stop TB Partnership** (a UN-hosted organisation) takes bold and smart risks to serve the needs and amplify the voices of the people, communities, and countries affected by TB.
    - The Stop TB board meets in Varanasi, India, and will coincide with World TB Day 2023 (March 24).
- **The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria** (2002) began disbursing money directed towards the global TB epidemic in 2003.

**Current obstacles in the global fight against TB:**

- The response has been short on urgency and long on processes.
- For example, The Global Fund r**emains hostage to the zero-sum games** imposed by donors and the champions of the three diseases.

**Key areas that remain under-served:**

- **Development and wide use of an adult TB vaccine:** The current vaccine is delivered at birth.
- **Getting newer therapeutic agents for TB**.
    - Moving to an injection-free and shorter all-oral pills regimen for TB (the current standard is for at least six months) will improve compliance and reduce patient fatigue.
- **The space of diagnostics.** There are exciting developments for use of AI-assisted handheld radiology with 90-second reporting and 95% plus accuracy for diagnosing TB.
    - This is a mature technology and should be rolled out universally immediately.

**Best practices:**

- **The COVID-19 vaccine development process** shows what can be done with the help of collective will and action.

### **CBAM or Carbon Tax**

 **Source:** [**LM**](https://www.livemint.com/industry/energy/eu-says-it-s-ready-to-work-with-india-on-carbon-tax-11679423674958.html)

 **Context:** European Union is willing to collaborate with India in easing the administrative burden for businesses while enforcing its Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).

**What is CBAM or Carbon Tax?**

It is a tax that imposes importers and non-EU manufacturers to pay for the carbon emission linked to the goods they sell within EU limits.

- Under the political agreement, the CBAM will **enter into force in its transitional phase as of 1 October 2023**

**Similar plans in the US:**

- **The Inflation Reduction Act** will allow the US to join with or mirror the EU’s plan to impose a carbon fee on imports of high-emitting goods.

**Importance:**

- It seeks to **impose tariffs on imports** with a high carbon footprint entering the 27-member bloc.
- Encourage cleaner industrial production in non-EU countries

**Implication for India:**

- Indian exports (India exports about **$2 billion worth** of products annually to the EU) could attract a **20-35% duty** on key Indian shipments, potentially clouding free trade talks between the two sides
- Against the principle of [**Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities.**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/11/28/common-but-differentiated-responsibilities-and-respective-capabilities-cbdr-rc/)

India is considering imposing **retaliatory tariffs on EU imports** in response to CBAM, which India said is discriminatory towards developing nations.

**What is Carbon Leakage?**

**Carbon leakage** refers to a situation where **efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions** in one country or region are offset by increased emissions in another country or region with less strict emissions regulations.

This occurs when **companies move their production or operations to countries with weaker environmental regulations** in order to avoid the costs associated with reducing emissions.
