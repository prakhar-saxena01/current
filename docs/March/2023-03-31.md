### [India and the Korean war](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/31/india-and-the-korean-war/)

#### **GS Paper 1**

 **Syllabus:** **History of the World**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/g20-presidency-global-south-india-korean-war-8529177/)

 **Context:**  In its G20 year, India has shown renewed interest in the only other diplomatic intervention by India in a distant war (apart from the recent Russian-Ukraine) seven decades ago – **The Korean War**.

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/korea.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/korea.png)

**The Korean war:**

- It was fought between **North Korea** (supported by China and the then Soviet Union and invaded South Korea) and **South Korea** (supported by the US and allied countries) in **1950** and ended with an armistice in **1953**.
- It was the result of the **Cold War** rivalry between the then superpowers US (capitalist) and the Soviet Union (communist).
    - The peninsula had been divided at the **end of World War II** along the **38th Parallel**, with Soviet and US forces occupying the North and South respectively.
    - **In 1948,** after the two Koreas declared themselves separate countries, and held their own elections, the occupying forces departed.
    - However, neither the North nor the South accepted the other and **both claim the entire Korean peninsula** even today.

**India’s lesser-known role in the war:**

- India played a unique role, having **no specific geo-political interests** in the Korean Peninsula and maintaining **a neutral position,** and believing in the **reunification of the peninsula**.
- India’s view at this time was that giving the **People’s Republic of China admission** into the UNSC could provide a resolution in Korea.
- India made a **huge diplomatic push to prevent an escalation** into another world war, and for the parties to arrive at a quick ceasefire.
- India sent the **60th Parachute Field Ambulance**, which did outstanding work treating wounded soldiers.

**India at the UN:**

- At the time of the invasion, **India was among the six non-permanent members** of the UNSC.
- During its rotating presidency, **3 resolutions** (moved by the US) **on the war** came up in quick succession. **For example,** calling for a withdrawal of North troops from South territory, etc.
- The urgent problem of what to do with the **prisoners of war** was given to **K. Krishna Menon** – India’s Permanent Representative to the UN and a member of the UN’s Special Political Committee.
    - A **Neutral Nations Repatriation Committee** was set up and India was selected to chair the committee.

**Conclusion:**

- In an essay, ‘**Between the Blocs: India, the UN, and Ending the Korean War’**, British historian Robert Barnes recognised the key role played by India
    - To bring the Korean war to a swift conclusion **by reconciling the divergent positions of the two superpower blocs**, and
    - Prevent the UN from adopting a policy that might lead to its escalation.
- As the world grapples to find an end to the war in Ukraine, **India’s role and its experience (in ending the Korean war,70 years ago) can’t be neglected.**

### [Apex body for glacier management](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/31/apex-body-for-glacier-management/)

#### **GS Paper 1**

 **Syllabus: Geography**

**Source:** [IE](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/house-panel-proposes-overarching-apex-body-for-glacier-management/)

**Context**: A Parliamentary Standing Committee in India has recommended the establishment of an **overarching apex body for** [**glacier**](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/glacier/) **management in the country**.

**What are** [**glaciers**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/world-geography/physical-geography-of-the-world/geomorphology/external-forces-their-impact/landforms-developed-out-of-external-forces/erosion-by-ice-glacier/)**?**

A glacier is a large, perennial **accumulation of crystalline ice, snow, rock, sediment**, and often liquid water that originates on land and **moves downslope under the influence of its own weight and gravity.**

**Status of Glaciers:**

- Glaciers cover nearly 3**% of Earth’s surface and 11%** of Earth’s land area
- **Source of three large river systems:** Indus, Ganges, Brahmaputra
- **Hindu Kush Himalayan** Region is known as the “**Water Towers of Asia**“
- **Himalayan** mountains are referred to as the **third pole**
- **India has over 16000 glaciers**. E.g Siachen glacier in the Himalayan region.

**Threats recognized:**

- **The majority of Himalayan glaciers are melting or retreating**, which will severely affect flow in Himalayan River systems
- **Melting glaciers can cause disasters** like [Glacier Lake Outburst Floods (GLOF),](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/02/08/what-is-a-glacier-outburst-flood-and-why-does-it-occur/) glacier avalanches, etc.
- **Melting of glaciers may lead to the shift of tree lines** in the Himalayas and may also cause a change in the **phonological behaviour** of plants.
- **Lack of data sharing on hydrological information** with neighbouring countries
- **Multiple ministries/departments/institutions** with different mandates for dealing with Himalayan glaciers

**Recommendations by the parliamentary panel:**

- **Set up a single nodal agency** for bringing out synergies among various government departments/ministries involved in glaciological research and monitoring
- **Establish regional cooperation** for the seamless sharing of hydrological information/data on glacier movement/behaviour
- **Create a multi-hazard alert and warning** system
- **Increase involvement of Himalayan states, planners, scientists, and academicians** in devising suitable measures for glacier management

### [Competition (Amendment) Bill, 2022 passed in LS](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/31/competition-amendment-bill-2022-passed-in-ls/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus****: Indian Economy**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/business/lok-sabha-approves-competition-law-tweaks/article66676205.ece#:~:text=The%20Lok%20Sabha%20on%20Wednesday,of%20the%20CCI's%20settlement%20mechanism)

 **Context:** The Lok Sabha on Wednesday cleared the [**Competition (Amendment) Bill, 2022**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/15/competition-law-amendments-of-penalties-and-misses/)

**Aim of the Bill:**

Bring in greater **regulation of corporates (particularly Big Tech firms)**

and promote and sustain competition in markets, protects consumers’ interest, and ensures freedom of trade for market participants.

**Background of the bill:**

It was introduced by the Ministry of Finance to **amend the Competition Act, 2002** to bring it in line with the modern development of new technology and the digital market. In December 2022, the Bill was referred to the **Parliamentary Standing Committee** on Finance for further scrutiny.

**Key Features of the Competition (Amendment) 2022 Act**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Feature**|**Description**|**Significance**|
|**Increases the regulation of combinations based on the ‘Value of Transaction’**|**Definition**: ‘**Combinations’** means mergers, acquisitions, or amalgamation of an enterprise.<br><br>Any transaction **exceeding ₹2,000 crore** would require CCIs approval, helping to bring **acquisitions in digital markets** (Big Tech firms) under it.<br><br>Also, the bill **prohibits entering into a combination** that may cause an appreciable adverse effect on competition.|**Enhances scrutiny and regulation of larger transactions** to prevent anti-competitive practices.|
|**Reduces the time limit for approval of combinations**|The bill reduces the time limit for CCI approval on such transactions to **150 days from 210 days**|**Speeds up the approval process** for combinations, providing greater certainty for businesses.|
|**Expands the definition of ‘control’ for the classification of combinations**|**Definition**: ‘**Control’** means, who (individual or other enterprises) exercises influence in the company.<br><br>The bill expands the **definition of control as the ability to exercise material influence over the management, affairs, or strategic** commercial decisions of an enterprise.|It now provides **greater clarity** on which transactions will be scrutinized.|
|**Broadens the scope of Anti-competitive agreements**|**Definition: Anti-competitive agreements are a**ny agreement for goods or services which has an **appreciable adverse effect on competition in India** and is therefore prohibited.<br><br>As per the new Bill, even the enterprises or persons **not engaged in identical or similar businesses** shall be presumed to be part of such agreements if they actively participate in such agreements.<br><br>Previously, such entities were exempted.|Including participation by unrelated entities, **strengthens the regulation** of such agreements.|
|**Introduces Framework for Settlement and Commitment in anti-competitive proceedings**|The bill provides a framework for **settlement and commitment for faster resolution of investigations by CCI.**<br><br>The bill **limits the time period for filing information** on it to CCI to three years.|Allows for **faster resolution of anti-competitive** proceedings and encourages enterprises to self-regulate.|
|**Decriminalisation of certain offences**|The Bill changes the nature of punishment for certain offences from the **imposition of fines to civil penalties**.|Reduces the burden on courts and provides a more proportionate punishment for certain offences.|
|**Penalties**|**CCI can impose a penalty of up to 10%** of a company’s average turnover in the “relevant market.<br><br>“**Turnover”** will refer to the “**global turnover derived** from all the products and services by a person or an enterprise”|Experts say this is the highly **contentious provision** that will result in higher penalties for global multi-product companies.|

**Terms used in the Bill**

- **Hub-and-Spoke Cartels:** Entities not engaged in similar businesses but have influence. The amendment broadens the **scope of ‘anti-competitive agreements’** to catch entities that facilitate cartelisation even if they are not engaged in identical trade practices.
- **Gun Jumping:** Gun jumping refers to the **illegal practice of prematurely disclosing information** or completing a transaction related to a merger or acquisition before the transaction has been fully approved by regulatory authorities.
- **New Age Market**: New technology-enabled firms or new types of businesses, that are not under the preview of CCI

**Way forward:**

**‘A National Competition Policy’ is needed in India:** E.g. Competition policy has also been adopted and implemented by the UK, Australia, Denmark, Italy, Turkey, Mexico, Hong Kong, Malawi and Botswana.

**Conclusion:**

With the new changes, the Commission should be better able to manage certain aspects of the New Age market and make its operation more robust.

**About CCI**

**The** [**Competition Commission of India**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/03/18/competition-commission-of-india-cci-3/) (est. 2009  under the Competition Act, 2002; Ministry Of Corporate Affairs) is a **statutory, quasi-judicial body**, which primarily pursues three issues of anti-competitive practices in the market:

- Anti-competitive agreements.
- Abuse of dominance.

CCI consists of **one Chairperson and six Members** who shall be appointed by the Central Government.

### [How to manage India’s solar PV waste problem?](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/31/how-to-manage-indias-solar-pv-waste-problem/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Conservation, Environmental Pollution and Degradation**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/india-solar-push-looming-waste-management-challenge/article66674910.ece)

**Context:** Even while Indian policymakers are working hard to shift to a [**circular economy**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Circular-Economy.pdf), there are still **no defined guidelines for waste management** in the **solar photovoltaic (PV) sector**.

**A typical PV panel is dominated by: Crystalline silicon (c-Si) technology** → 93% of c-Si modules (made up of silver, tin and lead) and 7% of cadmium telluride (CdTe) thin film modules (made of glass, encapsulant, and compound semiconductor).

**What is PV waste?**

- India stands **4th** in solar PV deployment globally and its solar power installed capacity has reached **~62 GW** by 2022.
- India’s latest **PLI scheme** promotes the domestic manufacturing of high-efficiency solar PV modules.
- This is great, but it also indicates **massive amounts of solar PV waste in the future**.
- India could generate **50,000-3,25,000 tonnes** of cumulative PV waste by 2030 and more than **4 million tonnes by 2050 (**International Renewable Energy Agency) → expected to make India **one of the world’s top five leading** PV waste producers.
- **~50% of total materials** can be recovered through waste management and recycling processes.

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/waste.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/waste.png)

**Challenges:**

- **Growing informal (~80%) handling of PV waste** → **accumulates at landfills** → causes acidification, leaching of toxic metals (lead, cadmium) into the soil → contaminates the local water.
- **Gradual incineration** releases pollutants like sulphur dioxide, hydrogen fluoride, and hydrogen cyanide into the atmosphere.
- **Misinformation/ignorance** about appropriate disposal practices among multiple actors and institutions (producers/owners/consumers/waste disposal facilities) across the supply chain.
- **The market** to recycle PV waste is **minuscule in India** because of a lack of suitable incentives and schemes.
- **The absence of a body** to measure, monitor, and report solar PV waste.

**Recent initiatives by the Indian govt:**

- **Revised** [**e-waste management Rules in 2022**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/11/11/government-notified-e-waste-management-rules-2022/)**:** MoEF&CC brought solar PV cells, panels, and modules under its ambit.
- **Green Credit Programme:** Launched under the Environmental Protection Act (1986) and announced in the UB 2022-2023, it aims to promote green growth and sustainable practices.

**Best practices:**

- **EU:** Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive makes producers responsible for safely and responsibly disposing of end-of-life PV panels.
- **US**: States have the freedom to establish their own solar PV regulatory standards.
- **Japan:** Manufacturers are responsible for developing environment-friendly recycling technologies through PPP and launching awareness campaigns about their benefits.
- **China:** Introduced life-cycle management to improve the resource efficiency of solar PV panels. It is also **developing recycling processes to recover silicon** and process them back into solar wafers.

**Gaps to be identified by India:**

- **Not to club PV waste with other e-waste**. India should –
    - **Formulate provisions** specific to PV waste treatment within the ambit of the e-waste guidelines. **Build a legislative framework** to enforce the Extended Producer Responsibility Rules.
    - **Set up a central insurance or a regulatory body** to protect against financial losses incurred in waste collection and treatment.
- **Not to classify PV wastes as ‘hazardous’.** India should –
    - Run pan-India sensitisation drives and awareness programmes,
    - Specify clear recycling targets and recycling rates in the PV waste management policy.
- **More attention to domestic R&D efforts** promoted through suitable regulatory incentives, recycling programmes, appropriate infrastructure facilities, and adequate funding.

**Conclusion:** Best practices could be a good reference point for India to develop **‘Made in India’** manufacturing capabilities, recycling technologies, and waste management strategies in this field.

### [India ranks fifth in national contribution to warming: Study](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/31/india-ranks-fifth-in-national-contribution-to-warming-study/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Conservation, Environmental Pollution and Degradation**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/climate-change/india-ranks-fifth-in-national-contribution-to-warming-study-88529#:~:text=Overall%2C%20the%20country%20ranks%20fifth,and%20N2O%20since%20the%201850s.)

 **Context:** According to a new study, **India is responsible for 0.08 degrees Celsius of warming from the 1850s through 2021.** 

**Overall findings:**

- **Contribution to warming:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**CO2**|**1.11°C**|
|**Methane**|**0.41°C**|
|**Nitrous oxide**|**0.08°C**|

- **Ranking Of Countries as per their contribution to the Rise in temperature:**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Rank**|**Country**|**Contribution in % to rise in temperature/warming**|
|**1**|USA|Nearly 17%|
|**2**|China|Nearly 12%|
|**3**|Russia|Nearly 6%|
|**4**|Brazil|Nearly 5%|
|**5**|India|Nearly 5%|
|- Since 2005, India climbed to the fifth spot from the 10th.<br>- China, too, rose to the second position after overtaking Russia.<br>- Indonesia, Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Canada each contributed 0.03-0.05°C of warming.|   |   |

**India-specific findings:**

- Overall, **India ranks fifth** among the top 10 contributors to warming.
- India’s emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) – **CO2, CH4 and nitrous oxide (N2O)** from 1851-2021 have resulted in **0****.****04°C, 0.03°C and 0.006°C** of global warming over pre-industrial levels, respectively.

**Causes of warming:**

- **Fossil fuel remains the biggest culprit.**
- **Land use, land-use change, and forestry** (LULUCF) accounted for **38%** of the total warming from CH4 and 72% from N2O emissions between 1851-2021.
- **The contribution of India, China and Brazil** towards warming due to CH4 and N2O increased by 110%, 56% and 55%, respectively, compared to CO2-related warming alone.

**Significance:**

- These 3 GHGs are included in most countries’ **Nationally Determined Contributions.** Hence, the dataset is uniquely positioned to **inform climate policy and benchmarking**.
- It would help in **tracking contributions to climate change** and understanding the **burden of responsibility carried by each country** → pursuing equitable decarbonisation pathways.

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus: Environment Conservation**

**Source:** [**WB**](https://www.worldbank.org/en/region/sar/publication/striving-for-clean-air)

 **Context:** According to **the World Bank’s ‘Striving for Clean Air: Air Pollution and Public Health in South Asia’** report, **9 out of the world’s 10 cities with the worst air pollution are in South Asia.**

**Highlights of the report:**

- This report **quantifies particulate matter (PM) emissions** and how they disperse in the atmosphere.
- **Ambient air pollution is a public health crisis** in South Asia,
    - Not only imposing high economic costs
    - But also causing an estimated 2 million premature deaths each year.
- In South Asia, **nearly 60% of the population** lives in areas where concentrations of 5 exceed an annual mean of 35 μg/m3 (WHO prescribes 5 μg/m3).
- In the densely populated **Indo-Gangetic Plain**, it is over 20 times higher than the WHO-prescribed levels.
- This report identifies **six major airsheds in South Asia** where spatial interdependence in air quality is high.

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/six_illu.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/six_illu.png)

**Main causes of air pollution in South Asia:**

- **Solid fuel combustion**
- The current management practices of **municipal waste** in the region, include burning plastics.
- Generation of secondary PM in the form of **ammonia (NH₃)** emissions related to the agriculture sector.
- In the western part of South Asia, natural sources, such as **dust, sea salt, and forest fires**, are an important source of air pollution.

**Way ahead:**

- Controlling ambient air pollution is difficult without a **better understanding of the activities** that emit PM and how emissions travel across locations.
- **Interdependence in air quality within airsheds** in South Asia is necessary when weighing **alternative pathways for pollution control**.

**Focusing on hotspots through regional cooperation** would reduce mean exposure to 26 μg/m³.

### [New fees on UPI payments](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/31/new-fees-on-upi-payments/)

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**TOI**](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/new-fees-on-upi-payments-why-paytm-gpay-phonepe-and-other-users-need-not-worry/articleshow/99084060.cms)**,** [**LM**](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/upi-new-rules-what-is-ppi-and-how-will-it-impact-users-11680096123758.html)

**Context:** The **National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI)** has allowed prepaid payment instruments (PPIs) to be part of the interoperable [Unified Payments Interface (UPI)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/05/the-unified-payments-interface-upi/) ecosystem.

**What does the new guideline say?**

- The new guidelines, effective from April 1st, levy a **1.****1% charge on UPI transactions above ₹2,000** while using PPIs.
- **The charges are only applicable for PPI merchant transactions**, and there are no charges for the bank account to bank account-based UPI payments.

**Explanation using an example:**

**A PPI payment via UPI** means a transaction done via a **wallet, like PhonePe Wallet** through a UPI QR code. This means that if users **have money in their say PhonePe Wallet** and want to make a payment via the merchant’s UPI QR code, then on transactions above Rs 2,000, an interchange fee of up to **1.1%** will be levied. This fee is **charged to the merchant** and not the customer.

**Benefit:**

- The move is expected to **help UPI merchants,** who can accept wallet payments regardless of the wallet being used by the customer, thereby **increasing payment alternatives** for customers.
- The **interoperability of KYC wallets will also eliminate** the need for customers to carry multiple cards and reduce fraud and theft.

**What are PPIs?**

 **The payment and Settlement Act, 2005** defined Prepaid Payment Instruments (PPIs) as instruments of **payment that facilitate buying of goods and services**, including the transfer of funds, financial services and remittances, against the value stored within or on the instrument.

 **Examples:** Online wallets like PAYTM wallets, Amazon Pay wallets and preloaded gift cards

**About NPCI**

**Context:**  The **National Dairy Research Institute** ( est. 1956, under ICAR, based in Haryana’s Karnal) has produced the **first-ever clone of a calf belonging to the indigenous Gir cow breed**. The calf has been named Ganga.

**Process:**

Scientists used **three animals for producing this calf**: **Oocyte** was taken from the **Sahiwal breed**, a somatic cell from the **Gir breed**, and a **surrogate animal** was a crossbreed.

**What is Reproductive cloning?**

Reproductive cloning is a process by which an exact genetic replica, or clone, of an existing organism, is created through a type of cloning called somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). This involves removing the nucleus of an egg cell and replacing it with the nucleus of a somatic cell (a non-reproductive cell) from the organism to be cloned.
