### [India misses Renewable Energy: Parliamentary panel](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/22/india-misses-renewable-energy-parliamentary-panel/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus:** **Infrastructure/Environment/Conservation**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/india-misses-re-capacity-target-due-to-low-solar-rooftop-wind-energy-project-installations-parliamentary-panel/article66646350.ece)

**Context:** A parliamentary panel has attributed the low installation of solar roof-top and wind energy projects as key reasons for the shortfall in achieving India’s [**renewable energy** (RE)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/10/sansad-tv-future-of-green-energy-in-india/) **capacity target of 175 GW by 2022.**

**Background:**

- India set an ambitious target (in 2014) of installing 175 GW of RE capacity by the year 2022, which included **100 GW (solar), 60 GW (wind), 10 GW (bio-power), and 5 GW (small hydropower).**
- While India has enhanced its promises to RE in the “**Long-Term Low-Carbon Development Plan**” presented at the **UNFCCC COP27**, it appears that the nation will fall short of one of its initial pledges in the RE sector.

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/175-GW.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/175-GW.png)

**Findings of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Energy:**

- A RE capacity of**90 GW** (69% of the overall target) **has been installed** in the country as of December 31, 2022.
- This is a commendable achievement, as the RE installed capacity has **increased by more than 236% since 2014**.
- Whatever shortfall has occurred in achieving the target is because of **the low installation of solar roof-tops and wind energy projects.**
    - Against 40 GW, **only 7.40 GW** of rooftop solar projects could be installed in the country.
    - Against 60 GW, the cumulative installed capacity of wind power is 41.93 GW.

**Issues responsible for deficient performance under the solar rooftop programme:**

- Non-availability of information at the grass root level,
- Lack of awareness about this scheme amongst the masses,
- The apathy of discoms, etc.

**Recommendations:**

- Keeping in view India’s commitment to increase its **non-fossil fuel-based energy capacity to 500 GW by 2030**, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) must ramp up its pace for the timely achievement of targets.
- **A strict timeline** should be imposed for approvals/rejection of applications, installation of net-metre, an inspection of the system, etc., by the discoms.
    - As of Feb 2023, out of 43,171 applications received on the National Portal, 18437 – were approved by DISCOMs, 3031 – were rejected on technical grounds and the rest are pending.
- **Discoms may be incentivised** to allay their concerns about losing their high-paying customers as a result of the installation of solar rooftops.
- The MNRE should **increase its fund absorption capacity** and focus on exhaustive utilization of the budgetary allocation.
    - In the Union Budget 2023-24, Rs 10,222 crore has been allocated to MNRE with **an increase of 45%** against the Revised Estimates of 2022.

### [National Strategy and Roadmap for Medical and Wellness Tourism](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/22/national-strategy-and-roadmap-for-medical-and-wellness-tourism/)

#### **GS Paper 2/3**

**Syllabus:** **Government policies/Issues Relating to Health/Economy**

**Source:** [**PIB**](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1908865)

 **Context:** With an aim to improve medical tourism in the country, the Ministry of Tourism has formulated a **National Strategy and Roadmap for Medical and Wellness Tourism (2022).**

**Background:** India has been ranked **10th** in the **Medical Tourism Index (MTI) for 2020-2021 out of 46** destinations in the world by the Medical Tourism Association.

**Medical vs wellness tourism:**

- **Medical tourism** (valued at $60-80 billion globally) primarily addresses the “**poor health**” end of the market, with patients travelling to another place for specific medical treatments.
- **Wellness tourism** (~$639 billion), on the other hand, attracts those seeking destinations that extend their **wellness lifestyle** and help them proactively maintain and improve their health and well-being.
- As far as medical tourism is concerned, India currently has a **$5-6 billion market** (2019 figure) that may rise to **$13 billion by 2026.**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/foregine.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/foregine.png)

**Govt. efforts to boost the medical tourism sector in India:**

**Streamlining** **Medical Value Travel (MVT)**: A segment that attracted 0.7 million foreign tourists in pre-pandemic 2019.

- **MVT is a specialised service** by Hospitals and Wellness centres including both modern as well as traditional systems of medicine.
- It involves healthcare service providers, VISA requirements, insurance, MVT facilitators, etc.

**National Strategy and Roadmap for Medical and Wellness Tourism (2022):** Key pillars for the development of MVT in the country:

- **Develop a brand** for India as a wellness destination
- **Strengthen the ecosystem** for medical and wellness tourism
- **Enable digitalization** by setting up an **Online Medical Value Travel (MVT) Portal**
- Enhancement of **accessibility** for Medical Value Travel
- **Promoting** Wellness Tourism
- **Governance and Institutional Framework**

**Heal in India Initiative:** The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the Ministry of Ayush have been working with C-DAC and the Services Export Promotion Council for developing a One Step Heal in India portal for the Promotion of MVT.

**Champion Service Sector Scheme:** The Ministry of Ayush developed a Central Sector Scheme for MVT to incentivise private investors for the establishment of Super Specialty Hospitals, etc.

**e-Tourist Visa scheme:** It was liberalised and renamed as an e-Visa scheme and at present, it has **e-Medical Visa and e-Medical Attendant Visa** as sub-categories of e-visa.

**National Medical & Wellness Tourism Board (NMWTB):** The Ministry of Tourism constituted the Board in 2015 to provide a dedicated institutional framework to take forward the cause of promotion of Medical and Wellness Tourism.

### [House panel suggests prepaid cards for power to save groundwater](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/22/house-panel-suggests-prepaid-cards-for-power-to-save-groundwater/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus:** **Conservation, environmental pollution and degradation**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/house-panel-suggests-prepaid-cards-for-power-to-save-groundwater-8508938/)

**Context:** In order to prevent excessive exploitation of [groundwater (GW](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/07/un-groundwater-summit-2022/)), a Parliamentary Standing Committee report recommends **discouraging the use of electric pumps** by introducing measures such as pre-paid cards, etc.

**Highlights of the report – “Groundwater: A Valuable but Diminishing Resource”:**

- **Over-extraction of GW** for meeting irrigation needs is prevalent in Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan, meeting 97%, 90%, and 86% of their irrigation needs from GW extraction.
- Others such as Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and UP are also significant users of GW for irrigation.

**The main reason for such overexploitation of GW:**

- **Wide cultivation of water guzzler** paddy and sugarcane crops which are heavily incentivised by way of highly subsidised pricing of water, etc.
- **For example**, states like Punjab, Haryana, Telangana and Tamil Nadu **offer completely free power**, while others collect token charges.

**Challenges:** The central government’s **inability to persuade** states to reduce/stop subsidies for the power given in agriculture as –

- Water being a **State subject**
- Electricity is a **concurrent subject**, and
- State Electricity Regulatory Commissions determine the electricity tariff for retail supply to end consumers under the extant provisions of the **Electricity Act, 2003**.

**Recommendations:**

- Devising **integrated measures** for adoption in agriculture.
- Introduction of **pre-paid cards for power supply, restricting it for a few hours in the day**, etc.
- A need for a shift in **focus from ‘land productivity’ to ‘water productivity’** (production per cubic meter of water).
- The Ministry of Jal Shakti **to work out a policy to ensure judicious water use** not only to reduce dependence on GW but to reduce its footprint in agriculture by engaging the Agriculture Ministry.
- The Jal Shakti Ministry should urge both the Power Ministry and the Agriculture Ministry along with state governments **to take measures on the suggested lines.**

**Steps taken by the Indian government:**

- **Atal Bhujal Yojana** is a groundwater management scheme launched in 2019.
- **Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA) (2019):** It was launched in 256 water-stressed districts in the country to improve water availability including groundwater conditions in these areas.
- **Aquifer Mapping and Management Programme, etc.**

**Best practice:**

- The Punjab govt. **introduced a scheme to refund money to the farmers** if they consume less electricity.
- **Deendayal Upadhyay Gram Jyoti Yojana** of the Ministry of Power has a **separate component of agriculture and non-agriculture feeders**, facilitating judicious rostering of supply to agriculture & non-agriculture consumers in rural areas.

### [National Security Act](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/22/national-security-act/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Source:** [**Indian Express**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/amritpal-nsa-national-security-act-explained-criticisms-8509503/)

**Context**: **National Security Act** has been invoked in the **case of self-styled Sikh preacher and on-the-run Waris Punjab De chief Amritpal Singh.**

**About** [**National Security Act, 1980**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/security-issues/national-security/national-security-act-nsa-1980/)**:**

- NSA **“empowers the state to detain a person without a formal charge and without trial”.**
- Under the Act, a person is taken into custody to **prevent them** from acting in any manner prejudicial to “**the security of the state” or for “maintenance of the public order”.**
- It is an a**dministrative order passed either by the Divisional Commissioner or the District Magistrate (DM).**
- Even if a person is in **police custody, the District Magistrate can slap NSA against them**. Or, if a person has been **granted bail by a trial court, they can be immediately detained under the NS** If the person has been **acquitted by the court, the same person can be detained under the NSA.**
- The law t**akes away an individual’s constitutional right to be produced before the magistrate within 24 hour**s, as is the case when the accused is in police custody. **The detained person also does not have the right to move a bail application before a criminal court.**

**What are the grounds for detention?**

- NSA can be invoked to **prevent a person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the defence of India,** relations of India with foreign powers or the security of India. Among others, it can also be applied to **prevent a person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community.**
- An individual can be detained **without a charge for a maximum period of 12 months**.

**What is the protection available under the Act?**

- The Indian Constitution **allows both** [**preventive detention**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/08/03/preventive-detention-only-to-forestall-public-disorder-sc/) **and the right of protection against arrest and detention in certain cases,** enshrined under Article 22 of the Constitution.
- However, **Article 22(3) provides that the rights available to an arrested person will not be applicable in case of preventive detention, thus an exception is carved out.**
- One crucial procedural safeguard under the **NSA is granted under Article 22(5),** where all the **detained persons have the right to make an effective representation before an independent advisory board,** which consists of three members; and the board is chaired by a member who is, or has been, a judge of a high court.

### **Speedy Trial of Legislators**

**Source:** [**Th**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-for-state-specific-approach-to-setting-up-special-courts-for-speedily-trying-legislators/article66646346.ece#:~:text=The%20Supreme%20Court%20on%20March,of%20them%20concerning%20heinous%20offences.)

**Context:** SC has suggested a **State-specific approach (and not a “one-size-fits-all” approach)**  to setting up special courts for the speedy trial of legislators.

**Data:**

- Criminal cases against legislators are **5097, with 400** of them concerning heinous offences.
- **Around a third of the criminal cases** against elected representatives in the Lok Sabha and state assemblies have been **pending for at least five years**
- **30% of criminal cases** against MPs, and MLAs pending trial

**Background:**

**In 2017, the Supreme Court ordered** that special courts be set up across the country **to fast-track the long-pending** trials of lawmakers.

- Following this, 12 special courts were set up across 11 States exclusively to try sitting MPs and MLAs.

**Other observations by SC:**

The court is also considering a **plea for a lifetime ban on people convicted of offences** from contesting elections and becoming Members of Parliament and State Legislative Assemblies. However, the government had opposed it in 2020.

- **Currently, legislators face disqualification under the Representation of the People Act of 1951** for the period of the prison sentence and six years thereafter

- **The Constitution (Scheduled Caste) Order, 1950** challenged in the present case was based on historical data which established that “**no backwardness or oppression was ever faced by members of Christian or Islamic Society**.”
    - It allowed **only Hindus to be classified as SCs** and was later amended to include **Sikhs** in 1956, and **Buddhists** in 1990.
- The Centre had established a commission, under former **CJI KG Balakrishnan,** to examine the grant of SC status to persons converted to religions other than in the Presidential Orders issued under **Article 341 of the Constitution**.
- Under Article 341 –
    - **The President** may with respect to any State (after consultation with the Governor) or UT, may notify the SCs in relation to that State/UT.
    - **The Parliament** may by law include or exclude from the list of SCs specified in a notification issued.

**Other recommendations:**

- The National Commission for Religious and Linguistic Minorities, headed by erstwhile **CJI Ranganath Misra**, recommended a complete delinking of religion from the classification of SCs in 2007.
    - However, Parliament rejected these recommendations on account of inadequate field data.
- **The Sachar Committee**, to examine the socio-economic conditions of Indian Muslims, 2006 observed that the situation of Dalit Muslims did not improve even after conversion.
    - The report placed Muslims below SCs and STs in backwardness.

 **Context:** Recently, the Swiss government-brokered takeover of Credit Suisse by its larger rival UBS has wiped out the investment of bondholders and created fear for AT1 bondholders

**What is a Bond?**

Bonds are a type of security instrument, issued by governments and corporations when they want to raise money.

**What is an AT1 bond?**

AT1 bonds – sometimes known as contingent convertible bonds, or **CoCos** – are a type of debt issued by a bank that can be converted into equity if its capital levels fall below requirements.

**Why AT1 Bond?**

 It was introduced after the global financial crisis of 2007-08, banks were asked to operate using their own permanent capital as opposed to borrowed capital. This permanent capital is termed Tier 1 capital

Now, to shore up their Tier 1 capital, **banks were allowed to raise a special class of bonds known as AT1 bonds from investors**. AT1 bonds, like other bonds, **pay regular interest**. But they **do not have a maturity date**, as they are a permanent part of the bank’s capital, akin to equity.

**AT1 bonds are the riskiest bond as the issuing** bank can skip premium and interest payout if it is falling short of capital

 **Context:** 1670 Central and State social welfare (DBT) and good governance schemes have been notified for use of the Aadhaar.

**Biometrics-based de-duplication:**

- **Facial image+ 10 fingerprints and two IRIS**
- **Capability to detect** **attempted enrolment by using wrong fingers**, non-human fingers, gummy fingers, inverted IRIS images, the closing of eyes, etc.
- **Liveliness check of fingerprints:** Liveness detection detects a spoof attempt by determining whether the source of a biometric sample is a live human being or a fake representation.
- **Face authentication** with liveliness check

**Strengthening the Aadhaar Enrolment ecosystem**

- **GPS fencing has been embedded in the Enrolment machines**: An operator is required to verify the credentials of the Enrolment machine regularly with the UIDAI data centre and only a limited number of enrolments are allowed per day per machine.
- **Quality check**: State governments have been roped in for a quality check of all new adult enrolments.

**C-Veda is an India-UK project** (jointly funded by ICMR and UK’s Newton Grant from Medical Research Council (MRC))

**Objective**: It aims to investigate if environmental and genetic risk factors in industrialised countries and emerging societies distinctly shape brain function and behaviour. It has now established the largest neurodevelopmental database in India.

### **Terminator Zone**

**Context:** In a recent study, astronomers from the University of California explained the possibility of **extra-terrestrial life on far-off exoplanets** within a special region known as the “terminator zone”

**What is Terminator Zone?**

A terminator or twilight zone is a moving line that divides the daylit side and the dark night side of a planetary body.

- So, one side is always facing its star and one side that is always dark. It could exist in a “just right” temperature zone between too hot and too cold. Terminator zone planet can retain liquid water.

**Exoplanet**: An exoplanet or extrasolar planet is a planet outside the Solar System.
