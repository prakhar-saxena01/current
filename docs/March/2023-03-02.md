### [FCRA license of think tank CPR suspended](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/02/fcra-license-of-think-tank-cpr-suspended/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus: Role of NGOs**

**Source:** [**Indian Express**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/fcra-licence-of-think-tank-cpr-suspended-what-is-fcra-8473866/)

 **Context:** The Centre **suspended the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) license** of the Centre for Policy Research (CPR) following **prima facie inputs regarding the violation of funding norms.**

**About CPR:**

- The Government of India **recognizes CPR as a not-for-profit society** and contributions to the Centre are tax-exempt – according to its website.
- CPR receives grants from the **Indian Council for Social Science Research (ICSSR) and is a Department of Science and Technology-recognized institution.**
- CPR receives grants from a variety of domestic and international sources, including foundations, corporate philanthropy, governments, and multilateral agencies.

**What is the FCRA?**

- The FCRA was enacted **during the Emergency in 1976** amid apprehensions that foreign powers were interfering in India’s affairs by pumping money into the country through independent organizations.
- The law sought to **regulate foreign donations to individuals and associations**.
- An [amended FCRA was enacted in 2010](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/05/12/foreign-contribution-regulation-act-2010-2/) to “consolidate the law” on the **utilization of foreign funds, and “to prohibit” their use for “any activities detrimental to the national interest”.**
- The law was amended again in **2020, giving the government tighter control and scrutiny over the receipt and utilization of foreign funds by NGOs.**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/FCRA.jpg?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/FCRA.jpg)

FCRA requires every person or NGO **seeking to receive foreign donations to be**

- registered under the Act,
- to open a bank account for the receipt of foreign funds in the State Bank of India, Delhi, and
- to utilize those funds only for the purpose for which they have been received and as stipulated in the Act.

The Act prohibits the receipt of **foreign funds by candidates for elections, journalists or newspaper and media broadcast companies, judges and government servants, members of the legislature and political parties or their office-bearers, and organizations of a political nature.**

**How is FCRA registration granted?**

- FCRA registrations are granted to individuals or **associations that have definite cultural, economic, educational, religious, and social programmes.**

**For how long is the approval granted and when is it suspended?** [**Click on this link**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/10/24/fcra-and-ngo/)

### [The case for open, verifiable forest cover data](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/02/the-case-for-open-verifiable-forest-cover-data/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Conservation-related issues**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/india-forest-tree-cover-data-deforestation-explained-8474163/) 

**Context:** The article highlights how India mapped its forest cover over four decades and why making the data freely available will improve the quality of this vital policy input.

**Forest and tree cover in India:**

- While the **Forest Survey of India** (FSI) started publishing its **biennial** State of Forest reports in
- Since 19.53% in the early 1980s, India’s **forest cover has increased to 21.71% in 2021**.
- The country’s **total green cover** now stands at **24.****62%**, which was arrived after adding 2.91% tree cover estimated in 2021.
- The forest maps are based on the images purchased from the **National Remote Sensing Agency** (NRSA), another arm of the government (Dept of Space).

**How have these figures arrived?**

- **All plots of 1 hectare or more, with at least 10% tree canopy density**, are counted within forest cover (irrespective of land use/ownership).
- All land areas with tree **canopy density of 70%** or more are considered **very dense forests,** 40% and more – **dense forests** and those between 10-40% – **open forests**.
- **Isolated or small patches of trees** (less than 1 hectare) and not counted as forest are assessed for determining **tree cover**.

**Issues with green cover data in India:**

- Green cover data in India disregards the **UN benchmark** that does not include areas predominantly under agricultural and urban land use in forests.
- **Recorded forest area vs green cover**
    - In India, land recorded as forest in revenue records or proclaimed as forest under a forest law is described as a **Recorded Forest Area**.
    - Divided into Reserved, Protected and Unclassed forests, Recorded Forest Areas account for **58%** of India.
- **The inclusion of commercial plantations**, orchards, village homesteads, urban housings, etc., as dense forests.
- **The steady replacement of natural forests with plantations** is worrisome, as natural forests support a lot more biodiversity and stock a lot more carbon.
- **The outcome of the refinement of satellite images** was that the forest cover fell within the forest area while it increased outside.
- **Lack of manpower** limits the FSI’s scope for verifying the quality of remotely sensed data in the field.
- **The FSI never made its data freely available for public scrutiny** and bars the media from accessing its geo-referenced maps.

**Best practice:** Brazil maintains an open web platform, **TerraBrasilis**, for queries, analysis and dissemination of data on deforestation, forest cover change and forest fire.

**Conclusion:**

- India is one of the few countries to have a scientific system of periodic forest cover assessment that provides **valuable inputs** for planning, policy formulation and evidence-based decision-making.
- **Making the field data freely available** to the public can enable them to volunteer to verify the country’s forest data on the ground.

### [India wants energy transition on its own terms – without phasing out coal and with more grants](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/02/india-wants-energy-transition-on-its-own-terms-without-phasing-out-coal-and-with-more-grants/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Infrastructure (Energy)**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/india-clean-energy-transition-phasing-out-coal-grants-fetp/article66549079.ece#:~:text=Similar%20pacts%20have%20been%20signed,as%20they%20want%20coal%20out.)

 **Context:** India is unlikely to reach an agreement – **‘just energy transition partnership’ (JETP)** – with richer nations this year.

**Background:**

- According to the IEA, **India is the world’s third-largest power consumer**.
- Last year, the country faced **one of its worst power crises** as a heatwave swept across the nation.
- C**oal use will peak in India between 2030 and 2035,** meanwhile, the country needs funding to strengthen its renewable grid and infrastructure.

**About JETP with India:**

- **The Ministry of External Affairs** is considering JETP proposals as India helms the G20 presidency.
- The **G7** industrialised nations, together with Norway, Denmark and the EU, believe a JETP with India **will financially empower it to reduce emissions from power production**.

**Similar pacts:**

- JETPs with **South Africa and Indonesia** are all about coal phase-out.
- $15.5 billion for **Vietnam** to help it transition away from coal, with most of the money as loans.

**How does a JETP with India seem unlikely?**

- International funding rests on India committing to a **timeline to phase out coal**, which is not viable for the country as it will see an **increase in energy demand and the possible increase in coal capacity.**
- Hence, India wants a JETP on its own terms – **no phase-out of coal** and funds for clean energy expansion in the form of **grants**, not loans.

**Coal vs renewable energy debate in India:**

- India has recently **relaxed environmental consultations** on coal mine expansions, **boosted its coal production** and cited **coal as critical for energy security** in global climate dialogues.
- But the country still aims to reduce coal from the current 50% of its energy mix to about 30% by 2030, while **building 500 GW of new renewable capacity by 2030.**
- With renewable energy storage capacity currently weak and expensive, India will **phase out coal only when it is sure the transition won’t cause power disruptions.**

**Challenges for India:**

- At least five Indian states depend heavily on the **country’s coal economy.**
- To ensure **clean and affordable energy** for all while moving away from fossil fuel.
- To meet its renewable energy targets, India will have to invest an average of **$27.9 billion annually up to 2029**, but its budget allocations aren’t sufficient.

**Way ahead:**

- India’s transition efforts need to be **mindful of people’s energy aspirations** and alternate livelihood for workers.
- Even if we cannot cut down on coal, we have to prepare for a **phase-down.**

**Conclusion:**

India may be able to use its position as G20 leader this year to steer discussions on a deal toward **just transition** while scaling renewable capacity and investments in new technologies.

### [How to make India earthquake prepared](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/02/how-to-make-india-earthquake-prepared/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Disaster Management and Preparedness**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/lessons-from-turkey-how-to-make-india-earthquake-prepared-8474242/)

 **Context:** The Delhi HC asked the state government to file a status report and action plan on the structural safety of buildings in Delhi.

**Background:** Nearly **59%** of the Indian landmass is vulnerable to earthquakes and the concerns that have been raised by the court need a policy response.

 **[![seismic_zone](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/seismic_zone.jpg?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/seismic_zone.jpg)**

**India’s current policy on earthquake preparedness:**

- Operates primarily at the **scale of structural details**
- **National Building Codes**: Includes specifying dimensions of the structural members – columns, beams, etc.
- **National Retrofitting Programme** **2014**: Under the programme, **the RBI directed banks to deny loans** for buildings that do not meet the earthquake-resistant design.

**Issues with the policy:**

- It ignores the buildings that were **constructed before such codes were published in 1962**
- It assumes infallibility in the processes of enforcement – **relying only on penalisation and illegalities**
- It treats earthquakes as a **problem of individual buildings** – in complete isolation from their urban context.
- **None of the urban renewal programmes** – including the Smart Cities Mission – have devised an urban policy for earthquake preparedness

**Way ahead:**

- **Earthquake preparedness** needs to act –
    - In the realm of policy and not just legal enforcement.
    - At the scale of building details as well as that of cities.
- **A comprehensive policy** to create a system of **retrofitting** existing structures and **enforcing seismic codes** with more efficiency. Such a policy should include measures –
    - To create a system of tax-based or development rights-based incentives for retrofitting one’s building up to seismic codes.
    - To ensure better enforcement of seismic codes through a similar model.
- **Generate earthquake vulnerability maps** with the percentage of vulnerable structures in the area, the availability of evacuation routes, the location of nearest relief services, etc.

**Best practices (Japan and San Francisco):**

- **Japan** has invested heavily in technological measures (skyscrapers with counterweights, small houses on flexible foundations, public infrastructure with automated triggers) by cultivating an industry around earthquake mitigation and fostering expertise.
- **San Francisco** is the world’s most famous earthquake-prone city which implemented policy changes similar to Japan.
- **The Gujarat government:** Immediately adopted (after the 2001 Bhuj earthquake) new **town planning schemes that widened roads** and created routes for evacuation and relief work.
- **Programmes like the ongoing Urban 20 meetings**: An excellent opportunity for international knowledge exchange on earthquake preparedness.

**Conclusion:** A policy on earthquake preparedness will require a **visionary, radical and transformative approach.** It would be unwise to wait for another earthquake to learn how to be better prepared for one.

###  [Why do we get compassion fatigue](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/02/why-do-we-get-compassion-fatigue/)

#### **GS Paper 4**

**Syllabus****: Human Values: Compassion**

**Source:** [**Indian Express**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/why-we-get-compassion-fatigue-8472070/#:~:text=Compassion%20fatigue%20is%20a%20form,cope%20with%2C%E2%80%9D%20said%20Bushman.)

**Context:** Images of traumatic events online, insensitive news, pandemics, etc. have attributed to the rising **instances of compassion fatigue in recent years.**

**About Compassion Fatigue:**

- Compassion fatigue is a state of **emotional exhaustion and burnout that can result from continuously** caring for and empathizing with others who are **experiencing pain or suffering**.
- It **causes us to lose our capacity to react and help those in need.**

**Instances of how compassion fatigue develops:**

- **Violence in digital media formats like video games and films can desensitize people’s responses to suffering or violence in real life.**
- The consequence of **seeing violent images is that you become numb to them and you think violence is no big deal.**
- **Soldiers:** Being in war – develops compassion fatigue.
- **Doctors and Nurses**

**Why Compassion fatigue occurs:**

- **Compassion fatigue is a form of emotional protection**
- The psychological mechanism **behind compassion fatigue is desensitization**.
- Desensitization to violence and trauma can be an important **adaptive strategy for people whose work involves frequent exposure to traumatic events, like soldiers, aid workers, and doctors.**

**Example:** Research shows how the conflict in Israel and Palestine **escalates violence in children.**

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/compssion.jpg?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/compssion.jpg)**

**How to reverse compassion fatigue:**

- Use social media to create **empathy and compassion among people**
- Take care of yourself: Self-care is essential to avoid burnout.
- Practice mindfulness: Mindfulness meditation
- Seek support
- Take time off

### **Phasing out the line, ‘math is not for a girl’**

**Source:** [**The Hindu**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/phasing-out-the-line-math-is-not-for-a-girl/article66568747.ece)

 **Direction: This example can be used in the essay/GS2 Social Justice/ Ethics – how to remove biases from society.**

  **Context:** Various research has shown that the representation of females in **Science, Technology, Engineering, and** **Mathematics (STEM) or other math-intensive fields and careers remains far from ‘fair’ or desirable.**

- In recent research, a paper from the Annual Survey of Education Report (ASER) conducted across rural India findings shows that **boys outperform girls in mathematics significantly, which has been persistent over time. The difference in reading scores, on the other hand, is negligible.**
- There is a considerable variation though; **while in the north Indian States of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Madhya Pradesh, boys outperform girls substantially, in south India, girls outperform boys in mathematics.**

**More social norms than ‘ability’**

- **“science and maths are meant for boys and arts and humanities for girls”** is reflective of the kind of stereotyping that parents, relatives/neighbours, and even schoolteachers push.

**The National Education Policy 2020 (NEP**), recognizes the existence of **continued disparities across all social groups and the need for developing interventions** that enhance attendance and academic performance for girls.

- **Targeted behavioural interventions** can curb the gender stereotyping of “math is not for a girl” at the household, societal, and school levels.
- **References to female mathematicians in textbooks, female names, and characters** in word problems, and **providing exposure to female role models in STEM fields** in the course curriculum are among other **simple tweaks that are worth trying and likely to be beneficial.**

### **Cultural Burns**

 **Source**: [DTE](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/world/indigenous-knowledge-australian-aboriginal-fire-practices-can-help-protect-koalas-from-bushfires-study-finds-87987)

As per the new research, **traditional fire burning practices or ‘cultural burns’ by indigenous Australians** can help protect the iconic koala.

The cultural burns were **cooler, lower, and slower than hot fires**, encouraging the regeneration of suitable native plants while **controlling other species (like banksias and wattle)** to reduce the risk of fire reaching the canopy where **koalas** lived.

**The United Nations** has noted that **traditional knowledge of land management**, including the use of fire to manage fuel, can be an **effective way of reducing wildfire hazards** and ensuring that biodiversity and cultural and ecological values are respected.

**About Koala:**

**They are** **arboreal** **herbivorous** **marsupial** **native** to Australia. The koala is one of 110 priority species that the Australian government aims to save from extinction over the next 10 years.

**Usage:** It can be used to show the importance of traditional knowledge in environmental conservation as well as the way to mitigate the risk of forest fires.

### **Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures (OECMs)**

 **Source:** [**IUCN**](https://www.iucn.org/our-union/commissions/group/iucn-wcpa-other-effective-area-based-conservation-measures-specialist)**,** [**SDG Knowledge Hub**](https://sdg.iisd.org/news/impac5-recognizes-role-of-other-area-based-measures-in-protecting-ocean/)

OECMs are **areas outside of protected areas** that are governed and managed to achieve effective conservation of biodiversity.

- **Examples of OECMs:** agricultural systems, conserved water catchments, locally managed marine areas, and other high conservation value areas.
- It was recognized by **Convention on Biological diversity guidelines** in 2018.
- **World Database on OECMs:** Contains data on OECMs identified by Governments, organizations, Indigenous peoples, and local communities.

**Significance:**

- They provide **support for effective long-term conservation efforts** outside of designated protected areas.
- OECMs promote **equitable governance, and positive conservation outcomes**, supporting threatened species recovery, supporting sustainable livelihoods, and addressing climate change.

**Usage:** The example can be used for environment questions as another dimension in conservation

### **Climate Justice**

 **Source**: [TH](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/international-courts-and-climate-change/article66564780.ece)

A group of 16 countries, led by **Vanuatu**, is seeking an **advisory opinion** from the **International Court of Justice (ICJ)** on “What are the **legal consequences for states that have caused significant harm to the climate system** and vulnerable states”.

Also, **The Commission of Small Island States on Climate Change and International Law** has also sought the **advisory opinion** of the **International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS)** on the specific obligations of countries about preventing, controlling, and reducing pollution of the marine environment.

**Climate justice** is a concept that addresses the just division, fair sharing, and equitable distribution of the burdens of climate change and its mitigation and responsibilities to deal with climate change

**Usage**: These examples can be used as an effort for Climate Justice esp. for small Island states and vulnerable countries.

### **What is a whip in a state Assembly or Parliament?**

**Source:** [**Indian Express**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/what-whip-state-assembly-parliament-8473933/)

 **Context:** A five-judge Bench led by the Chief Justice of India is hearing petitions filed in the wake of last year’s political crisis in Maharashtra – raising the importance of whip.

**What is a ‘whip’ in the House?**

- In parliamentary parlance, a whip may refer to **both a written order to members of a party in the House** **to abide by a certain direction and to a designated official of the party who is authorized to issue such a direction**.
- The term is derived from the **old British practice of “whipping in” lawmakers to follow the party line.**

**How serious are whips issued by parties?**

The importance of a whip can be inferred from the **number of times an order is underlined.**

- A **one-line whip** underlined once, is usually issued to **inform party members of a vote, and allows them to abstain in case they decide not to follow the party line.**
- A two-**line whip directs them to be present during the vote.**
- A **three-line whip is the strongest**, employed on important **occasions such as the second reading of a Bill or a no-confidence motion, and places an obligation on members to toe the party line.**

**What can happen if a whip is defied?**

- **United Kingdom** – an MP can **lose membership of the party for defying the whip**, but can keep her/ his House seat as an Independent.
- **US** – the party whip’s role is to gauge how **many legislators are in support of a Bill and how many** are opposed to it — and the extent possible, persuade them to vote according to the party line on the issue.
- **India** – rebelling against a **three-line whip can put a lawmaker’s membership in the House at risk**. The **anti-defection law allows the Speaker/ Chairperson to disqualify such a member**; the only exception is when there is merger of the party.

 **Context:** Supreme Court refused to hear a plea by Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia.

- **Reason**: SC disapproved of Sisodia approaching it directly under **Article 32 of the Constitution** when the remedy of moving the **High Court under Section 482 of the CrPC** was available to him.
- The court had **rejected** Sisodia’s arguments that **he had a right against self-incrimination**

**What is right against self-incrimination?**

**Article 20(3):** “No person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself.”

- Since the onus of **proving the case against the accused (in criminal cases) beyond a reasonable doubt** is on the **state**, a person cannot be compelled to testify against himself or share information that **might go against him in a trial**

**About Delhi excise policy case:**

 **Now-scrapped liquor sales policy** (2021) allowed **only private shops to sell liquor** and permitted home delivery and unlimited discounts. It relieved the state from the sale of liquor. The policy resulted in a **27% increase in revenue** for the government. However, there were allegations of bending rules and providing undue benefits to liquor vend licensees.

### **DNA vaccine against dengue**

 **Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/health/decoding-dengue-india-s-first-prospective-dna-vaccine-against-disease-is-promising-but-challenges-lie-ahead-87951#:~:text=Published%3A%20Wednesday%2001%20March%202023&text=In%20a%20significant%20development%20in,after%20exposure%20to%20the%20disease.)

 **Context**: In a significant development in **DNA vaccination research, India’s first and only DNA vaccine candidate for dengue has shown promising results.**

**About DNA Vaccines:**

- A DNA vaccine is a vaccine that **puts a specific DNA sequence that codes for an antigen** into an organism’s cells to trigger an immune response.
- The world’s first DNA vaccine—**ZyCoV-D,** developed by **Zydus Cadila**—was approved in 2021 for emergency **use against COVID-19.**

**Why developing an effective DNA vaccine for dengue is tough?**

- Because it is caused by **four closely related viruses—DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3 and DEN-4**—called serotypes.
- Each one **interacts differently with antibodies in human blood**. A person infected with DEN-1 is then protected against it for life, but not against the other three serotypes. An ideal vaccine must target all serotypes.
