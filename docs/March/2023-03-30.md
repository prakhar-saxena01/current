### [Institute of Eminence (IOE) status](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/30/institute-of-eminence-ioe-status/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Issues Relating to the Development and Management of Social Sector/Services relating to Education, Human Resources**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/education/accelerate-granting-of-ioe-status-parliamentary-panel-tells-centre-seeks-status-notes-8524338/)

 **Context:** The Rajya Sabha Department-related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Education, Women, Children, Youth and Sports, has recommended

- To accelerate the process for granting the **Institute of Eminence** (IOE) status.
- To realign the IoE scheme with the **National Education Policy, 2020.**

**The IoE Scheme:**

**About**

- The UB 2016-17 announced **10 public and 10 private HEIs** are to be recognised to emerge as world-class institutions.
- As a result, UGC launched the IoE scheme in 2017 to –
    - Provide for high-quality teaching and research → excellence, and innovations.
    - Engage in areas of specialisation.
    - Enable HEIs to emerge as top 100 institutions in the world over time (top 500 by 2027).

**Benefits** 

- **Greater autonomy:**
    - **Administrative and academic:** Free to decide fee, flexible course duration and structure, exemption from approvals for collaborations with foreign institutions.
    - **Financial:** The selected **public** institutions will get **Rs 1,000 crore** each from the Ministry of Education.
- However, **no financial assistance** to the private institutions.

**Criteria for the selection/revocation of status**

- The institutions should be among **the top 50 in the NIRF** in their category, and **top 500** in internationally recognised rankings.
- **Public institutes** eligible to apply are central universities, govt-owned and controlled deemed to be universities, institutions of national importance (IITs, NITs), and state univs.

**Procedure:** Institutes need to submit a proposal → with milestones to be achieved over the next 5 to 15 years → To the **Empowered Expert Committee** (EEC constituted by UGC).

**Revocation of the status:** In case the institute fails to achieve scheme objectives at the end of the 5th and subsequent years, the EEC could penalise them.

- **Final action on revocation is to be taken by the Ministry of Education.**

**Analysis of the IoE scheme:**

- So far **12 –** 8 public + 4 private institutes have been granted the IoE status.
- **So far 8 public institutes have been sanctioned Rs 3,428 crore**, with IISc Bangalore accounting for the highest share (Rs 620.59 crore).
- It has helped 8 public universities **step up ambitious reforms and growth** – riding on the financial boost each has got as part of the scheme.
- However, many of the selected private campuses are **yet to realise the promised benefits** of the scheme.
- The **Government is dragging its feet on awarding the IoE status** to 2 public and 5 private HEIs. The absence of an EEC is holding up the process.

 **Context:** The Karnataka government’s recent decisions on the reservation have come under intense political debate.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Decisions**|**Need**|**Criticism**|
|●       **Did away with the 4% reservation** for Muslims in the OBC category.<br><br>●       **This 4% is to be distributed equally** among the Veerashaiva-Lingayats and Vokkaligas – **the 2 dominant land**-owning communities in the State.<br><br>●       Accorded internal reservation for 101 Scheduled Castes (SC).|●       The OBC reservation quota cannot be extended based on religion<br><br>●       The community no longer remains socially and educationally backward|●       **Vote-bank politics**<br><br>●       The Muslims were included based on the recommendations by the **Sachar Committee, L.G. Havanur and Chinnappa Reddy Commissions**.<br><br>●       **Any addition or deletion of a community** from the reservation matrix should be based on an **empirical study** by the Karnataka BC Commission.|

**Reservation to religious minorities:**

- At present, **there is no reservation in Civil Posts and Services** under the GoI and admission to Central Educational Institutions for Minority Communities.
- However, the Central Government carved out **a sub-quota of 5% for** minorities, as defined under the National Commission for Minorities Act 1992.
- This will be **within the 27% reservation for OBCs** in Civil Posts and Services under the GoI and admission to Central Educational Institutions.
- The constitutional validity of the matter is presently sub-judice in the SC.

### [India needs public policy education](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/30/india-needs-public-policy-education/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus:** **Important Aspects of Governance, Transparency and Accountability**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/india-needs-public-policy-education/article66675629.ece)

 **Context:** Even though good public policies spur economic growth, and public welfare and improve the ease of living for citizens, **there is little interest in public policy education in India.**

**Background:**

- Most executive jobs in the organised sector are in government/govt-owned agencies and require an understanding of **public policy and public administration**/**public management**.
- Though the Indian bureaucracy has many talented people, **governance is still perceived to be lagging behind private sector management** (efficient, effective).
- This is largely due to a **lack of training in public management** → policymakers are **under-equipped to develop effective policies**.

**Why does public management remain a neglected field in India?**

- **Inadequate formal education** in public management as compared to business management education (there are ~3,182 institutions).
    - Only ~130 public, private and not-for-profit universities offer **public administration programmes** and only 29 institutes offer **public policy programmes**.
- **Few jobs** available for people pursuing such courses are the reason why universities don’t have many programmes in public management.
    - Therefore, neither educational institutes nor students **find any incentive** to prefer public management courses.
- **Very few civil servants have had exposure** to public management before joining the service. Also, there are a **few opportunities for in-service officers to study public management** in India and abroad.

**Suggestions:**

- Public management should be **one of the compulsory subjects for the UPSC civil service examination**. This will help –
    - Civil servants have formal education in public management before they enter service.
    - In creating **an opportunity or incentive** for universities and private institutions to offer the subject at the graduate or PG level.
    - Students become **better citizens as well as effective private sector managers.**
- The existing training institutions of the government should have **a larger component of public policy as part of induction training.**
- The government can create **certain specialised positions for public policy analysts** to create new job avenues for the graduates of public policy programmes.

### [Experts urging a halt to Artificial Intelligence training](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/30/experts-urging-a-halt-to-artificial-intelligence-training/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus****: Science and Technology**

**Source:** [**BBC**](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-65110030)

 **Context:** Key figures in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), including **Twitter’s Elon Musk and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak**, have signed an open letter calling for a **suspension of the training of powerful AI systems**

**What are the dangers of developing super-intelligent AI?**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Dangers from AI**|**Examples**|
|**Risks to Human safety**|**AI-powered Autonomous weapons systems** that can make decisions without human intervention may lead to accidents, harm or death to civilians and military personnel.|
|**Job displacement and unemployment**|AI automation in industries such as **marketing, manufacturing, law, accounting and healthcare may lead to job losses**. Vulnerable sections and minorities are especially vulnerable to it.|
|**Social manipulation**|E.g., Social media platforms like **TikTok** rely on AI to **saturate a user’s feed with content related to previous media** they’ve viewed, making it easier to create an echo-chamber of manipulation.|
|**Social surveillance**|Governments and police may use **facial recognition technology** to track a **person’s movements and gather data** on their activities, relationships, and political views.|
|**Biases**|AI may be developed by humans who are **inherently biased**, leading to data and algorithmic bias that can amplify each other|
|**Existential risks**|E.g., scenarios where AI surpasses human intelligence, gains autonomy, and seeks to protect itself, potentially leading to conflicts with humans.|

**However, AI is also needed for solving the biggest challenges we face**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Problem**|**How AI can help**|**Example/Fact**|
|**Climate Change**|AI can help **reduce energy consumption,** improve renewable energy, and monitor and predict climate patterns.|**Google’s DeepMind AI** has reduced energy consumption at their data centres by **15%.**|
|**Disease Detection and Treatment**|AI can help identify diseases and develop treatments faster, improving patient outcomes.|AI algorithms have been developed to **detect breast cancer with greater accuracy** than human radiologists.|
|**Hunger and Food Security**|AI can help **optimize farming practices**, improve crop yields, and reduce food waste.|The use of **AI in precision agriculture** has been shown to increase crop yields by up to 30%.|
|**Poverty**|AI can help **improve access to education and job opportunities** for underserved communities.|AI-powered chatbots are being used to **provide education and job training to refugees in Lebanon.**|
|**Natural Disasters**|AI can help **predict and respond** to natural disasters, reducing their impact on human life and infrastructure.|**IBM’s Watson is being used to analyze data to predict the path of hurricanes**, helping communities to prepare and evacuate in advance.|

**What should be done?**

- **Risk analysis:** The open letter argues that AI labs should halt the training of AI systems that are **more powerful than GPT-4** for at least six months to ensure that these risks are appropriately addressed.
- **Development of new regulatory authorities dedicated to AI:** It will ensure that the technology is developed in a way that **benefits society and avoids catastrophic outcomes**

**Conclusion:**

AI has the potential to help solve many of the world’s problems, but it’s not a silver bullet solution and must be implemented responsibly and ethically.

### [Draft Carbon Credit Trading Scheme](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/30/draft-carbon-credit-trading-scheme/)

**GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus****: Environment Conservation**

**Source:** [**ET**](https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/power/power-ministry-seeks-comments-on-draft-carbon-credit-trading-scheme/99037310)

**Context:** The power ministry issued a draft **‘Carbon Credit Trading Scheme’** to **set up a framework for the Indian** [**carbon market**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/20/what-are-carbon-markets-and-how-do-they-operate/) and sought feedback from stakeholders.

**What is Carbon Credit?**

A carbon credit is a tradable permit representing the **right to emit a set amount of carbon dioxide** or the equivalent amount of a different greenhouse gas.

- It equals **one tonne** of carbon dioxide **removed, reduced, or sequestered** from the atmosphere.

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/carbon.jpg?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/carbon.jpg)

**What is Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS)?**

The ‘CCTS’ means the scheme for the **reduction or removal of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions notified** by the central government

**Background of CCTS:**

The parliament passed the **Energy Conservation (Amendment) Bill, 2022**. One of the provisions of this amendment included **empowering the central government** to “specify carbon trading scheme”, in consultation with the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE).

**Features of CCTS:**

- **‘Accredited carbon verifier’:** It is an agency accredited by the BEE to carry out validation or verification activities in respect of the CCTS.
- **Setting up of the** **Indian Carbon Market Governing Board** (ICMGB): for oversight, making rules for the Indian carbon market, guidelines regarding the sale of carbon credit certificates to outside India and other regulatory functions
    - **Environment secretaries** would be the ex-officio co-chairmen of ICMGB.
    - The ICMGB shall **meet at least once in a quarter** of every year
- **The Bureau of Energy Efficiency** shall be the **administrator** for the Indian carbon market and shall also work as the secretariat for the ICMGB.
- **The Grid Controller of India Ltd** shall be the registry for the Indian Carbon Market.
- **Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC)** shall be the regulator for the trading activities under the Indian carbon market

**Types of carbon markets:**

- **Compliance markets:** created to comply with a law
- **Voluntary markets:** Issuance, buying and selling of carbon credits, on a voluntary basis.

**Features of** [**The Energy Conservation (Amendment) Act 2022:**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/28/sansad-tv-perspective-the-energy-conservation-amendment-bill-2022/#:~:text=Parliament%20has%20passed%20the%20Energy,decarbonisation%20of%20the%20Indian%20economy.)

**Source:** [**LM**](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/blended-finance-can-fill-investment-gaps-to-meet-sdgs-11680020989635.html)

Blended finance is a **financing mechanism that combines public, private, and philanthropic funds** to support social and environmental projects.

**Significance**: Blended finance can help attract private capital to projects that are otherwise difficult to finance (e.g., projects related to the fulfilment of SDGs), and help achieve social and environmental objectives while generating financial returns for investors.

**Example:** **Sustainable Access to Markets and Resources for Innovative Delivery of Healthcare (Samridh)** is a blended financing entity, that mobilized a capital pool of $300 million to offer grant and debt financing provisions to healthcare enterprises and innovators during the COVID-19 pandemic.

- The scheme was launched by the Indian government, USAID, The Rockefeller Foundation etc.

**Context:** Astronomers recorded the brightest gamma-ray radiation ever in October 2022, causing disruptions in radio signals on Earth and cutting across our solar system.

- **The radiation pulse, named GRB 221009A**, was a birth cry of a black hole and lasted five minutes.

The observation **challenges the theory of how GRB jets produce light**. The observation has shown unexpected behaviour in the radio signals from the afterglow of the burst, which may indicate a completely new emission component.

**What are GRBs?**

GRBs are a **very bright and powerful explosion** of gamma rays, the most energetic form of light. Most GRBs are caused **by massive stars collapsing into black holes** or by the merging of two neutron stars.

**Significance**: They are **important to study because they can give us insights** into the early universe and the processes that drive the most powerful explosions in the cosmos.

**Related News:**

As per a recent observation, a **supermassive black hole** (hundreds of thousands to billions of times the Sun’s mass) has changed its direction and is directly facing toward the Earth. A **black hole** is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it.

|**Replication**|Not self-replicating, need a DNA template|Self-replicating|
|**Genetic information**|Can act as genetic material in some viruses|The primary genetic material in organisms|

**Why do most deadly viruses contain RNA?**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Reasons**|**Explanation**|**Examples**|
|**High mutation rate**|RNA viruses change quickly, allowing them to adapt to new environments and host species|Influenza virus, HIV, SARS-CoV-2|
|**Recombination**|RNA viruses can exchange genetic material, leading to the emergence of new strains|Norovirus, Hepatitis C virus, Rotavirus|
|**Wide host range**|RNA viruses can infect a variety of hosts, including animals and humans, leading to zoonotic diseases|Ebola virus, Zika virus, Nipah virus|
|**High viral loads**|RNA viruses can replicate quickly, producing large amounts of virus that can overwhelm the host’s immune system|Hepatitis A virus, Dengue virus, yellow fever virus|

On the other hand, **DNA is more stable, error-free and doesn’t mutate easily**.

### [Upward lightning](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/30/upward-lightning/)

#### **Facts for Prelims**

 **Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/what-is-upward-lighning-explained-8525379/#:~:text=With%20the%20negative%20charge%20repeatedly,is%20called%20an%20upward%20streamer.)

**Context**: Brazilian researchers recently captured high-speed video footage of positive upward discharges of electricity from lightning conductor rods in São José dos Campos

  **What is Upwards lightning?**

Upward lightning is a phenomenon where lightning streaks develop from tall objects that travel upward toward electrified storm clouds (opposite to normal Lightening)

**How does it happen?**

Upward lightning occurs when there is a **tall object, such as a building or a lightning rod**, on the ground and there is an **electrically charged storm cloud overhead**. The tall object creates a strong electric field near the ground, and this can initiate a channel of ionized air, **called an upward leader**, which moves upward from the object towards the cloud. When this upward leader connects with a downward-moving stepped leader from the cloud, it completes the circuit, and a discharge of electricity flows from the cloud to the ground.
