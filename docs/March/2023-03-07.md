#### **GS Paper 1**

**Syllabus: Geography- Geophysical phenomenon.**

**Source:** [**The Tribune**](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/all-12-districts-prone-to-landslides-isro-study-485645)**,** [**NRSC**](https://www.nrsc.gov.in/sites/default/files/pdf/Announcements/Landslide%20Atlas_2023.pdf) **(Data given in the article is taken from this report)**

**Context:** All 12 districts of Himachal Pradesh have **figured on a list prepared by the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC**) of locations prone **to landslides.**

- The **Landslide Atlas** of India was released by **Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO**) at the “**National Meet on Disaster Risk Management — Trends & Technologies**” held at Hyderabad.
- The **NRSC, one of the centres of ISRO, manages data from aerial and satellite sources.**

**About Landslide:**

- A landslide is **“a movement of a mass of rock, earth or debris down a slope”.**

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/falls.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/falls.png)**

**Types of flows**

- **Debris flows**: It is a form of rapid mass movement in which a combination of loose soil, rock, organic matter, and slurry that flows downslope. They are commonly caused by intense precipitation or rapid snowmelt.
- **Earth flow:** It is a down-slope viscous flow of fine-grained material saturated with water.
- **Mudflow:** A mudflow is a wet or viscous fluid mass of fine and coarse-grained material that flows rapidly along drainage channels.
- **Creep:** Creep is the **slow, steady, downward movement of material** under gravity that occurs in a large area

**Key Findings:**

- India is among the **top four countries with the highest landslide risk**, where every year the estimated loss of **life per 100 km2 is greater than one.**
- This Atlas provides risk assessment in **landslide locations during the period of 1998-2022 and covers vulnerable regions in 17 states and 02 UTs of India** in the Himalayas and Western Ghats.
- Northwest **Himalayas contribute 66.5% of landslides in India**, followed by Northeast Himalayas (**18.8%) and** **Western Ghats (14.7%).**
- Top 5 districts based on their exposure to landslide**: Rudraprayag and Tehri Garhwal (Uttarakhand), Thrissur (Kerala), Rajouri (J&K), and Palakkad (Kerala)**
- The database includes three types of landslide inventory – **seasonal, event-based and route-wise**

**About NRSC:**

National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) has the **mandate for the establishment of ground stations for receiving satellite data, generation of data products, dissemination to the users, development of techniques for remote sensing applications including disaster management support**, geospatial services for good governance and capacity building for professionals, faculty, and students.

### [Even with ‘moderate emissions’, India’s heat is set to get worse](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/07/even-with-moderate-emissions-indias-heat-is-set-to-get-worse/)

#### **GS Paper 1**

**Syllabus:** **Important Geophysical phenomena**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/even-with-moderate-emissions-indias-heat-is-set-to-get-worse/article66583449.ece#:~:text=Climate%20projections%20for%20the%20districts,a%20'moderate%20emissions'%20scenario.)

**Context:** The climate crisis is no longer a distant event that might happen in the future.

**Indications of the impending climate crisis:**

- Temperatures are rising, rainfall patterns are shifting, and **extreme events such as record-high temperatures**, etc.
- **For example,** the month of February (this year) in India was the hottest since 1901.
- According to a 2021 study (The Lancet), **more than five million people died** (between 2000-2019) on average each year worldwide because of extreme temperatures.
- **The IPCC 6th Assessment Report** states that **extreme heat events will grow** with increasing global warming.

**The case of India:**

- A study shows that the temperature in India has been **steadily increasing during both summer and winter.**
- The recorded increase in maximum and minimum temperature over 30 years (1990-2019) is up to **0.****9º C and 0.5º** **C**, respectively.

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/trends1.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/trends1.png)**

**Impact of increasing heat:**

- A cause of suffering and **death** in extreme cases.
- It undermines systems such as **agriculture and other climate-sensitive sectors** that support the livelihoods and well-being of people.

**Climate projections for the districts of India (2021-2050):**

- **The summer maximum temperature will increase** (between 2º C – 3.5º C) even under a ‘moderate emissions’ scenario.
- **Even winter minimum temperatures are projected to increase** by 0.5º C to 3.5º C in the future.
- **The diurnal temperature range** (DTR – variation between high and low air temperature during a single day) is also changing.
    - A Department of Science and Technology study (2020) shows **an asymmetric increase in the minimum temperature** compared to the maximum.
- This will, in turn, increase the risk of **heat stress** → drought, deteriorating soil quality, crop failure, job loss, higher migration, morbidity, and mortality → can affect ecological systems, and the carbon economy.
- According to a 2019 ILO report, India is expected **to lose 5.8% of working hours in 2030 due to heat stress.**

**Way ahead:**

- Implement the [**Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/03/19/united-nations-office-for-disaster-risk-reduction-unisdr/) through improved **early warning systems, public awareness, and formulation of heat action plans.**
- Prepare **district-level heat hotspot maps** to design long-term measures to reduce deaths due to extreme heat.

**Best practices: Innovative strategies** such as –

- Emergency cooling centres (similar to the ones in Toronto and Paris);
- **Survival guides** that are strategically displayed to survive extreme heat or heat waves (like in Athens);
- **White roofs** (Los Angeles);
- Green rooftops (Rotterdam);
- Self-shading tower blocks (Abu Dhabi); and
- Green corridors (Medellin).

### [What does it take to buy an electoral bond?](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/07/what-does-it-take-to-buy-an-electoral-bond/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus:** **Government Policies and Interventions and Issues arising out of their Design and Implementation**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/what-it-takes-to-buy-an-electoral-bond-8479640/#:~:text=The%20payment%20is%20made%20through,Financial%20System%20Code%20(IFSC))

**Context:** Five years ago, the sale window for the first tranche of Electoral Bonds was opened in March 2018.

**Introduction of Electoral bonds:**

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/electrol_bond_1-1-e1668078212541.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/electrol_bond_1-1-e1668078212541.png)**

- The Electoral Bond Scheme (EBS), announced in the 2017 Union Budget, was notified by the Central Government in **2018**.
- These bonds **can be purchased from select SBI branches** by any Indian person or corporation incorporated in India.

**Performance of EBS:**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ond_sale.jpg?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ond_sale.jpg)

**Concerns related to the operation of EBS:**

- **Introduce a new type of anonymity by –**
    - Reducing public and legislative oversight. **For example**, only the ruling party via the SBI has a full account of all donations.
    - **Political parties do not disclose electoral bond donors.** The only requirement is the annual audit reports with all donations received via electoral bonds.
- **Impact of anonymity:** Dilutes one voter-one vote principle, an undue advantage to the ruling party, etc.

**Way ahead:**

- In 2021, the SC refused to stay the sale of electoral bonds and **suggested bringing in more transparency.**
- The information regarding donors and donations **should be accessible to the Parliament, the Election Commission of India and the Opposition via SBI.**
- **The RTI must be strengthened**.
- Ex-CEC (OP Rawat) suggests that the political funding scheme could be improved by appointing an “**independent watchdog**”.

**Best practice:** Jharkhand Mukti Morcha recently disclosed the identities of EB donors – the first political party to do so

**Importance of Green H2 for India:**

- India has committed to **50% electricity capacity from non-fossil sources by 2030**.
- **An energy transition in the industry** (most GHG emissions come from steel, cement, fertilizers, and petrochemicals) is needed at the same time.
- Green H2 can serve as an **energy source** (heavy industry, mobility, and power storage) and an **energy carrier** (as green ammonia/blended with natural gas).
    - It holds the promise of **fuelling industrial growth while simultaneously reducing industrial emissions**.
- With abundant sunshine and wind energy resources, **India is geographically blessed** to become one of the lowest-cost producers of green H2.

**Priorities to convert the vision into reality:** Government and industry must act in sync for –

- **Becoming a big player domestically** – a necessity to be a major player in the international market.
    - The mission introduces a **Strategic Interventions for Green Hydrogen Transition** (**SIGHT**) fund (₹13,000 crores) to support heavy industries to increase demand, offering economies of scale, etc.
    - **Blending mandates for refineries** can be another demand trigger.
- As the second-largest steel producer in the world, **India can aspire to become the largest green steel producer**.
    - Costs of green steel, made from green H2, could be reduced with e**conomies of scale and changes in production technologies.**
- India can be **an attractive destination for domestic and foreign investment**.
    - A mission secretariat can ensure project clearance is streamlined and reduce financial risks.
- **Becoming more competitive** (with targeted public funding) in manufacturing the most critical and high-value components of **electrolysers** in India.
    - The SIGHT fund offers ₹4,500 crores to support electrolyser manufacturing under the **performance-linked incentive scheme**.
    - The mission **allocates ₹400 crores for R&D**, which can be leveraged to crowd in private capital into technology co-development
- **Establishing bilateral partnerships to develop resilient supply chains**.
    - **Indian companies should consider joint projects** in countries with good renewable energy resources and cheap finance to become **export competitive.**
- India must coordinate with major economies **to develop rules** for a global green H2 economy.
    - **India’s G20 presidency** is an opportunity to craft rules, addressing operational threats, industrial competitiveness and strategic threats.
- India should **promote a global network** of green hydrogen via which companies could collaborate.

**Conclusion**

Green hydrogen will be a critical industrial fuel of the 21st century. India is well-positioned to show leadership, which is in India’s and the planet’s collective interest.

### **Global Greenhouse Gas Monitoring Infrastructure (GGGMI)**

 **Source:** [**The Hindu**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/un-takes-step-towards-new-way-of-tracking-greenhouse-gases/article66587986.ece) 

**Context:** The **U.N.’s World Meteorological Organization** has come up with **a new Global Greenhouse Gas Monitoring Infrastructure** that aims to provide better ways of **measuring planet-warming pollution and help inform policy choices.**

**About the GGGMI:**

- **Need:** The current global greenhouse gas (GHG) monitoring relies **heavily on research funding and capabilities,** which makes sustained monitoring challenging.
    - The three major greenhouse gases are **carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. Of those, CO2 accounts for around 66% of the warming effect on the climate.**
- **Working** The GGGMI will engage with the broader scientific community and other UN agencies involved in GHG monitoring activities.
- **Benefit**: The infrastructure will improve our understanding of the carbon cycle and provide critical and timely input to the UNFCCC processes.
    - It will help humans understand climate change and to provide support to mitigation action taken by the Parties to the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement.

The increase in **CO2 levels from 2020 to 2021 was higher than the average growth rate over the past decade,** and methane saw the biggest year-on-year jump since measurements.

The 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change saw countries agree to cap global warming at **“well below” two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above levels measured between 1850 and 1900 – and 1.5C if possible.**

**About WMO:**

The **World Meteorological Organization (est. 1950; HQ: Geneva)** is a **specialized agency** of the United Nations responsible for promoting international cooperation on atmospheric science, climatology, hydrology and geophysics

### **Lewis superacids**

 **Source:** [**The Hindu**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/what-are-lewis-super-acids/article66566719.ece#:~:text=Because%20Lewis%20acids%20add%20electron,bonds%20requires%20highly%20reactive%20substances.)

 **Context:** Researchers at **Paderborn University, Germany** have reported being able to make a **unique class of catalysts** – used in chemistry to accelerate reactions – **called “Lewis super-acids**”

- These can be used to **break strong chemical bonds and speed up reactions.**

 **What are Lewis Acids and Bases?**

- A Lewis acid is any substance, suc**h as a Hydrogen ion (H+) that can accept a pair of nonbonding electrons.** In other words, a **Lewis acid is an electron-pair acceptor.**
- A Lewis base is any substance, **such as the OH- ion, that can donate a pair of nonbonding electrons. A Lewis base is therefore an electron-pair donor.**

**Applicability:**

Being able to make these super acids, **enables non-biodegradable fluorinated hydrocarbons,** similar to **Teflon, and possibly even climate-damaging greenhouse gases, such as Sulphur hexafluoride, to** be **converted back into sustainable chemicals**.

**Diseases spread by proximity to Pigeon**

- Pigeons may lead to various kinds of lung diseases, ranging from respiratory allergies to serious infections.
- Severe cases may lead to **Pneumonia-Psittacosis**, which is a bacterial infection
- **Hypersensitive pneumonia** (a lung disease which is contracted by living near pigeons) (also known as Pigeon Breeder’s Disease)
- **Histoplasmosis** (fungal infection with high mortality rates)
- **Cryptococcal infections** (it may lead to pulmonary or meningeal infections)

**Mode of transmission:** The breathable antigen arising from the bird droppings and feathers goes into the lung and leads to an immunological reaction, which damages the lung.

**Context**: India has proposed to launch a mega global alliance under its leadership to protect big cats and assured support over five years with **guaranteed funding of $100 million**

**About IBCA**

- **Aim**:
    - Protection and conservation of the **seven major big cats — tiger, lion, leopard, snow leopard, puma, jaguar and cheetah**.
    - To **provide a platform for** “dissemination of information on benchmarked practices, capacity building, resources repository, research and development, awareness creation”, etc., on the protection and conservation of big cats.
- **Governance structure**:
    - **General Assembly** (consisting of all member countries)
    - **A council** (seven to 15 member countries elected by the General Assembly for a term of 5 years)
    - **A Secretariat** (headed by IBCA Secretary General for a specific term)
- **Funding**: 1st five years will be supported by India’s “total grant assistance” of $100 million.
    - After that IBCA is expected to sustain itself through membership fees, and contributions from bilateral and multilateral institutions and the private sector. However, the proposed move has invited criticism, too.
- **Membership**: It will be open to 97 “range” countries, which contain the natural habitat of these big cats, as well as other interested nations, international organisations, etc.

India is the **only country in the world** to have tigers, lions, leopards, snow leopards and cheetahs in the wild. India has all the big cats, except **the pumas and jaguars**, today.
