### [What does the Ministry of Mines’ draft Geo-heritage Sites and Geo-relics Bill say?](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/15/what-does-the-ministry-of-mines-draft-geo-heritage-sites-and-geo-relics-bill-say/)

#### **GS Paper  1**

 **Syllabus:** **Indian culture will cover the salient aspects of Art Forms, literature and Architecture from ancient to modern times**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/draft-geo-heritage-sites-geo-relics-bill-explained-8444976/#:~:text=*The%20Bill%20imposes%20a%20prohibition,work%20essential%20to%20the%20public.) 

**Context:** The Union Ministry of Mines notified the draft Geo-heritage Sites and Geo-relics (Preservation and Maintenance) Bill, 2022, for public comments.

**Background:**

- The **Geological Survey of India** (GSI, established in 1851, comes under the Ministry of Mines) investigates and assesses coal and other mineral resources of the country through regional-level exploration.
- **It declares geo-heritage sites**/ national geological monuments and along with the respective state governments takes necessary measures to protect these sites.
- **The 32 geo-heritage sites are spread across 13 states** and despite identifying these sites, there are concerns over their preservation, including Fossil Parks (e.g. Siwalik Fossil Park, Himachal Pradesh); Geological Marvels (e.g. Lonar Lake, Maharashtra), Rock Monuments (e.g. Peninsular Gneiss, Karnataka) etc

**About the draft Bill and its salient provisions:**

- **It is aimed at providing** for the declaration, preservation, protection and maintenance of geo-heritage sites and geo-relics of national importance, for geological studies, education, research and awareness purposes.
- **It defines Geoheritage sites** as sites containing geo-relics and phenomena, stratigraphic type sections, geological structures and geomorphic landforms including –
    - **Caves**, natural rock sculptures of national and international interest; and
    - **Land adjoining the site** is required for their conservation/ access.
- **It defines a Geo-relic** as any relic or material of geological significance or interest like sediments, rocks, minerals, meteorites or fossils.
    - The GSI will have the **power to acquire geo-relics** for its preservation and maintenance.

**What does the draft Bill say regarding preservation?**

- **Authorise the Central Government** to declare a geo-heritage site to be of national importance.
    - This would be under the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 (**RFCTLARR Act**).
- **Compensation to the owner of land** in accordance with the RFCTLARR Act.
- **Prohibition on construction, reconstruction, repair or renovation** of any building within the geo-heritage site area.
- **Penalties for destruction, removal, defacement or contravention** of any direction issued by the Director General, GSI.

**Criticisms of the draft Bill:**

- The GSI has been given **sweeping powers.**
- The issue of land acquisition could also result in **friction with local communities.**

**Way ahead:** The experts call for the creation of a more inclusive body, akin to a **National Geoheritage Authority**, that can more democratically decide locations of “geohistorical” significance and how best to preserve them.

### [The missing Deputy Speaker: the post, and what the Constitution says](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/15/the-missing-deputy-speaker-the-post-and-what-the-constitution-says/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus****:** Appointment to various Constitutional posts, powers, functions, and responsibilities of various Constitutional Bodies.

**Source:** [**Indian Express**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/the-missing-dy-speaker-the-post-and-what-the-constitution-says-8445357/)

**Context:** The Supreme Court **has issued notices on a petition highlighting the** [**vacant posts of Deputy Speaker**s](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/09/03/long-wait-for-a-deputy-speaker-for-lok-sabha/) in Lok Sabha and five state assemblies for years.

- A Bench sought responses on a PIL that contends that not [electing a Deputy Speaker](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/10/21/electing-a-speaker-deputy-speaker-2/) to the 17th (present) Lok Sabha, is “**against the letter and spirit of the Constitution”.**

**Constitutional provisions regarding Deputy Speaker:**

- **Article 93** of the Constitution of India establishes the **post of the Deputy Speaker of Lok Sabha and Articles 94-96 detail their appointment, removal, and powers**.
- In the absence of the Speaker, **the Deputy Speaker serves as the Speaker and wields the full powers of the Speaker.**
- **Deputy Speaker is not subordinate to the Speaker** and is directly responsible to the House.
- **Article 178 of the Constitution establishes the post of Deputy Speaker** of assemblies and Articles 179-181 deal with their powers and appointment or resignation.

**Is it mandatory to have a Deputy Speaker?**

- Constitutional experts point out that **both Articles 93 and 178 use the word “shall**”, indicating that the election of Speaker and Deputy Speaker is mandatory under the Constitution.

**Do the powers of the Speaker extend to the Deputy Speaker as well?**

- Article 95(1) says: “**While the office of Speaker is vacant, the duties of the office shall be performed by the Deputy Speaker”.**
- The Deputy Speaker has the **same powers as the Speaker when presiding over a sitting of the House**. All references to the Speaker in the Rules are deemed to be references to the Deputy Speaker when he presides.

**What is the position of the Union government on the current vacancy in the post of Deputy Speaker?**

- The Treasury benches have maintained there is no “**immediate requirement” for a Deputy Speaker as “bills are being passed and discussions are being held” as normal in the House**. A Minister argued that “there is a panel of nine members — senior, experienced and selected from different parties — who can act as chairpersons to assist the Speaker to run the House”.

**Can the courts intervene in cases of a delay in electing the Deputy Speaker?**

- Article 122(1) says: “**The validity of any proceedings in Parliament shall not be called in question on the ground of any alleged irregularity of procedure.”**
- However, experts said that the **courts do have jurisdiction to at least inquire into why there has been no election to the post of Deputy Speaker since the Constitution does envisage an election** “as soon as may be”.

**Source:** [**LM**](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/competition-law-amendments-of-penalties-and-misses-11676313277888.html)

 **Context:** The government is set to introduce the **Competition (Amendment) Bill** (2023 Bill) in Parliament.

**Background:**

- The Bill, which seeks to amend the [**Competition Act, 2002**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/03/27/insights-into-editorial-the-promotion-of-competition-is-vital-to-the-indian-economy/#:~:text=The%20Competition%20Act%2C%202002%2C%20as%20amended%20by%20the,an%20appreciable%20adverse%20effect%20on%20competition%20within%20India.), was first introduced in Lok Sabha by the Finance Ministry in 2022 and referred to the Standing Committee, which submitted its report in December 2022.
- The 2002 Act seeks **to promote and sustain competition** in markets, protect the interest of consumers, and ensure freedom of trade for market participants.
    - It established the [**Competition Commission of India**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/05/22/competition-commission-of-india-cci/) (CCI) to eliminate practices having adverse effects on market competition.

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus****: Environment**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/climate-change/how-much-do-industrial-aerosols-contribute-to-global-cooling-new-study-offers-clues-87704#:~:text=The%20researchers%20found%20that%20higher,a%20global%20scale%20as%20well.)

 **Context**: A new study found that **inactive volcanoes contributed 66 percent of preindustrial era sulphate emissions**, which are known to have a **cooling effect on the planet**. This suggests that there are **more inactive or non-eruptive volcanoes emitting sulphates than previously estimated**, potentially leading to inaccuracies in future climate projections

**Key findings of the study:**

- By studying the ice core layers, the **team calculated the levels of sulphate** [**aerosols**](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/Aerosols) **between 1200 and 1850.** Their analysis showed **inactive volcanoes release up to three times the rate of sulphate emissions than previously believed.** 
- Climate **models do not consider hydrogen sulphide**, which escapes from inactive volcanoes. These gases react with **oxygen to produce sulphur dioxide within three days, forming sulphate aerosols.**
- Sulphur dioxide, released from natural as well as anthropogenic sources**, reacts with water vapour and other gases in the atmosphere to create sulphate aerosols.** They can cool the planet by reflecting sunlight into space. They **also form clouds, which also tend to have a cooling effect.**
- It argues that **underestimating emissions from the preindustrial era leads to overestimating the cooling effect of aerosols seen by global models.**
- It is estimated that anthropogenic aerosols **have nullified 60 percent of human-induced warming in the Arctic, which is warming at a rate almost four times higher than the global rate.**

[**About aerosols**](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/factsheets/Aerosols.html)**:**

- Aerosol is a **system of liquid or solid particles uniformly distributed in a finely divided state through a gas, usually air**.
- Aerosol particles, such as dust, **play an important role in the precipitation process, providing the nuclei upon which condensation and freezing take place.**
- [They affect climate](https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/climate-change-and-associated-issues/factors-that-cause-climate-change/) by **reflecting or absorbing incoming solar radiation and enhancing the brightness, and thus reflectivity, of clouds.** They also participate in chemical processes and influence the electrical properties of the atmosphere.

 **Context:** The article highlights the need to regulate the CAM (complementary and alternative medicine) system of medicine in India.

**Alternative medicine in India:**

- [**AYUSH**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/issues-related-to-health-sector/ayush-system-of-medicine/) – Ayurveda, yoga, naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and homeopathy – is now seeing a surge in demand as a result of **growing public awareness, usefulness, effectiveness, increased government backing and expanding R&D.**
- AYUSH is anticipated to grow **at a CAGR of 8.6%** during the forecast period of 2022–2027.
- India is currently **one of the top exporters** (US, Germany and France are major export destinations) of alternative medicines worldwide.

**Necessity of CAM:**

- **Higher incidence of disease** owing to pollution, stress and poor lifestyles.
- Integration of AYUSH to **advance** [**universal healthcare**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/issues-related-to-health-sector/universal-health-coverage/) and guarantee the **quality, safety, and efficacy of such treatments** ([**The WHO Traditional Medicine Strategy 2014-2023**](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241506096)).

**Issues associated with CAM:**

- **A dramatic increase** in the use since Covid-19, as a result of unprecedented interest in ‘**immunity boosters**’ as a [protective measure](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/09/07/ayush-prophylactic-medicines/).
- Contrary to popular belief, **Ayurvedic medicines can have side effects,** as all ‘natural substances’ are not safe for consumption.
- **Use of non-plant materials** and **illegal addition** of allopathic medicines.
- **Lack of regulatory mechanism and rising number of quacks.**
- **Absence of a standard composition** of AYUSH medicines.

[**What needs to be done**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/10/17/sansad-tv-committee-report-ayush-system-way-forward/)**?**

- Regulation to ensure safety and efficacy
- Checking therapeutic claims
- Proper labelling of ingredients

**Steps taken by the government:**

- A dedicated – **Ministry of AYUSH** – created in 2014
- A scheme for Voluntary Certification of Yoga Professionals
- A Centrally Sponsored Scheme of **National AYUSH Mission** (NAM)
- A Central Sector Scheme for promotion of **Information, Education and Communication** (IEC) in AYUSH
- A Central Sector Scheme for promotion of **International Cooperation**

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/steps_1.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/steps_1.png)**

**Conclusion:** Unless and until these drugs are investigated on scientific lines, control is not feasible. The need of the hour is to **build on different systems** that allow people **informed choices and a level playing field.**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/indian-air-forces-revised-doctrine-adopts-a-holistic-approach-to-the-countrys-security-imperatives-8442975/)

 **Context:** AeroIndia 2023 is not just the biggest exhibition of India’s air power push for Indian defence manufacturing, it also displays IAF’s revised doctrine.

**Background:**

- Despite the commitment of the IAF to national security, the history of India’s use of air power is **one of restraint** (except during the 1971 war).
- This is because –
    - **The lack of understanding of the rapid technological changes** in the features of air power on a global scale.
    - **India’s traditional surface-dominant security outlook** and viewing air power as a support service**.**

**Need for a revised doctrine:**

- Addressing India’s security concerns will require a **multidisciplinary approach** (rather two-dimensional) due to the fact that –
    - Asia is the focal point of the geopolitical turmoil and
    - India’s two adversaries have capable air forces.
- External (terrorism, border stand-offs) and internal security, **Sovereignty protection, deterrence, air diplomacy and nation-building** remain peace-time imperatives.
- To ensure [**SAGAR**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/05/12/mission-sagar/), as well as the [Indo-Pacific construct](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/02/11/indo-pacific-3/).

**The IAF’s revised doctrine:**

- Focus on the **criticality** of controlling the skies to
    - Provides **a clearer understanding of the redefined characteristics of aerospace power** and its expanded capabilities.
    - **Address contemporary and future warfare.**
- Acknowledges that future aerospace and defence capabilities are **national force multipliers.**
- **Offensive** air operations and air defence.
- **Holistic application of combat power**, comprising the IAF’s coordinated operations along with army-naval operations, civil aviation and space agencies.
    - The recent test landing of the naval variant of the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) on board INS Vikrant is a good example.

**Way ahead:**

- A novel air strategy covers the entire spectrum from peace and war to the **unique no-war-no-peace condition** confronting the country.
- Concepts of **human resources, training** and **operational testing and evaluation** remains a priority.
- The expansion of battle spaces ([cyber and electronic warfare](https://www.insightsonindia.com/security-issues/cyber-security/various-cyber-threats/cyber-warfare/), [information warfare](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/12/what-is-information-warfare)), the necessity of India’s future joint military strategy, **constitute the foundation of IAF’s future air strategy.**

**Conclusion:** Since national security is every citizen’s concern and given the efforts underway to evolve national defence and security strategies, the doctrine credibly conveys what aerospace power can and will do for the nation.

This is box title

**Highlights of Aero India 2023:**

- A series of strategic meetings to boost **self-reliance, joint production of advanced technologies and increasing defence exports,** will have immediate implications for India’s strategic security.
- The defence exports stood at a record Rs 14,000 crore in 2021-22, up from just Rs 1,520 crore in 2017.
- The PM has announced a hugely ambitious target of **$5 billion annual exports by 2024-25.** For this to happen,
    - [India’s defence exports](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/02/10/insights-into-editorial-the-brahmos-deal-and-indias-defence-exports/) have to focus not only on low- to medium-tech items but also on **high-tech items** (like BrahMos missile to the Philippines).
    - Advanced platforms like LCA need to be produced at a **fast pace.**
    - Different arms of the defence industry – private and government – **need to work together.**
