#### **GS Paper 1**

**Syllabus****: Geography –** Important Geophysical phenomena.

**Source:** [**Indian Express**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/unusual-feb-heat-and-the-normal-abnormal-in-global-weather-8459137/#:~:text=Average%20global%20temperatures%20in%202022,of%20the%20La%20Ni%C3%B1a%20event.)

 **Context**: Over the past week, maximum temperatures have been **5-11 degrees C higher than normal in** **most parts of northern and western India.**

**Reasons for abnormal heat:**

- According to the IMD, **an anticyclonic formation over south Gujarat is one of the main reasons** for the warming on the west coast.
- Around Maharashtra and Goa, a **weaker-than-usual sea breeze along the Konkan coast was aggravating** the effects of the [anticyclone.](https://www.insightsonindia.com/world-geography/physical-geography-of-the-world/climatology/cyclones-and-anticyclones/anti-cyclone/#:~:text=An%20anticyclone%20is%20a%20weather,(opposite%20to%20a%20cyclone).)
- This year is widely expected to be a little hotter than the previous two years, mainly because of the **expected end of the strongest-ever** [La Niña](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/10/22/what-is-la-nina-2/) **event.**

**What are** [**heat domes**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/07/03/what-is-the-heat-dome-causing-record-temperatures-in-parts-of-north-america/)**?**

- A heat dome is a **meteorological phenomenon that occurs when a high-pressure system traps hot air** in a region, **causing temperatures to rise and creating a dome of hot air**. This dome of hot air can persist for several days or weeks, leading to prolonged periods of extreme heat and heat waves.

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/heat_dome.png)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/heat_dome.png)**

**Effects of Heat Dome:**

- **They are dangerous for human health,** especially for vulnerable populations such as **the elderly, children, and those with preexisting health conditions.**
- **Impacts food production**
- **Increasing wildfires.**
- Lead to **droughts and other environmental impacts**
- Increased **energy demand** and strain on **the power grid due to increased use of air conditioning.**

**What can be done?**

- **Staying hydrated, avoiding outdoor activities** during the hottest parts of the day, and providing cooling centres for vulnerable populations.
- Governments and policymakers can also take steps to **reduce greenhouse gas emissions** and mitigate the impacts of **climate change to prevent the frequency and intensity of heat domes** from increasing further.

### [Rooftop solar for poverty alleviation](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/23/rooftop-solar-for-poverty-alleviation/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus: Energy: Renewable Solar Energy**

**Source:** [**BS**](https://www.business-standard.com/article/opinion/rooftop-solar-for-poverty-alleviation-123022101397_1.html)

  **Context:** A new white paper proposes a scheme for rooftop solar photovoltaics (RTPV) for [poverty alleviation.](https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-economy-3/poverty-and-unemployment/poverty/)

**Significance of RTPV for poverty alleviation in India:**

- **Access to Electricity:** Solar energy can provide access to electricity in remote areas that are not connected to the power grid, thus improving the quality of life for people living in poverty.
    - In China, RTPV is one of the identified **10 initiatives rolled out** by the government to lift rural households out of poverty.
- **Cost Savings:** For people living in poverty, who spend a significant portion of their income on energy, solar energy can help reduce their energy bills and save money.
- **Job Creation:** at the lower and middle level
- **Improved Health:** Solar energy can help reduce [indoor air pollution](https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/environment-pollution-and-control/air-pollution/) and improve the health of people living in poverty.
- **Climate Change Mitigation**

**Limitations:**

- **High initial cost**: Currently, the rooftop-subsidy programmes run by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy require consumers to bear about 60 per cent of the costs.
- **Roof Availability**: For many poor, having roof space is a luxury.
- **Dependence on Weather**: In areas with low sunlight, or during monsoon season, solar energy production may be limited, which can be a challenge for those relying on it for electricity.
- **Maintenance:** Solar panels require regular maintenance, which can be a challenge for people living in poverty who may not have the resources or knowledge to maintain them.
- **Implementation issues:** India had achievedjust 7.9 GW of installed rooftop solar capacity as of June 2022 (against a previous target of 40 GW by 2022).

**Government measures:**

- **National level:**
    - The government has extended the timeline for achieving its target of **40000 MW (40 GW)** rooftop solar (RTS) capacity addition, by March 2026.
        - **Gujarat, Maharashtra and Haryana states**are leading the way
    - [Grid-Connected Rooftop Solar Scheme](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/01/22/rooftop-solar-scheme/)
    - [**Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthaan Mahabhiyan (PM-KUSUM)**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/02/13/kisan-urja-suraksha-evam-utthaan-mahaabhiyan-or-kusum-scheme/): for grid-connected Renewable Energy power plants/Solar water pumps/grid-connected agriculture pumps)
    - [**National Wind-Solar Hybrid Policy 2018**](https://pib.gov.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=227282)**:**:To provide a framework for the promotion of large grid-connected wind-solar PV hybrid systems
    - **Atal Jyoti Yojana (AJAY, 2016):** for the installation of solar street lighting (SSL) systems in states with less than 50% of households covered with grid power
    - **National Solar Mission**(a part of the [National Action Plan on Climate Change](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/02/14/actions-undertaken-to-tackle-climate-change/))
    - **Surya Mitra Skill Development Programme:**To provide skill training to rural youth in handling solar installations.
- **International Level:**
    - [**International Solar Alliance**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/05/06/international-solar-alliance-6/)**:**
    - [**One Sun, One World, One Grid (**](https://isolaralliance.org/work/osowog/)**OSOWOG)**: a framework for facilitating global cooperation, for interconnected renewable energy resources

**What is the proposed scheme for RPTVs?**

**The report proposes a Central government-sponsored scheme in the field of RTPV.** It could be called **Sooraj Se Rozgaari**.

- Under the proposed scheme, IREDA will purchase RTPV modules in bulk and transfer them to states at a cheaper cost. Low-income households do not have to pay for any share of the costs of RTPV installation and maintenance. Social/institutional/small businesses bear 80 per cent of the costs, and households with regular incomes bear 60 per cent.

### [How to save our high seas from overfishing and pollution?](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/23/how-to-save-our-high-seas-from-overfishing-and-pollution/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus:** **Environment, Conservation**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/how-to-save-our-high-seas-from-overfishing-pollution-8459007/)

 **Context:** India urged the member nations of the [United Nations Convention on the Law of Sea](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/08/10/unclos-united-nations-convention-on-the-law-of-the-sea/) (UNCLOS) for the early conclusion of the International **Legally Binding** Instrument – [Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ).](https://www.un.org/bbnj/)

[Threats to marine biodiversity:](https://www.insightsonindia.com/world-geography/physical-geography-of-the-world/oceanography/marine-resources/)

- **Illegal/**[overfishing](https://www.worldwildlife.org/threats/overfishing)**, deep-sea mining, oil and gas drilling**, etc.
- **A vicious cycle:** the [warmer the ocean](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/ocean-warming/) gets/[ocean acidification](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Ocean-Acidification.pdf) → less/more CO2 it can store → changes in the PH level → threatening biodiversity (death of corals) → less protection the oceans can provide from extreme weather events.
- That’s why government officials from 51 countries want to negotiate the [High Seas Treaty at the UN in New York.](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/governance/fresh-negotiations-on-un-high-seas-treaty-begin-in-new-york-here-s-what-to-expect-87830#:~:text=Published%3A%20Tuesday%2021%20February%202023%20Photo%3A%20iStock%20A,%28BBNJ%29%20began%20in%20New%20York%20February%2020%2C%202023.)

**Why is a global treaty essential for the conservation of the high seas?**

- While the high seas (beyond national jurisdiction) make up **more than 60% of the world’s oceans**, they have drawn far less attention than coastal waters.
- **Multiple organisations** control fishing, shipping, tourism and ocean protection, however, their regulations apply to **200 nm** (370 km) from the coast.
- The entire **sea industry is equivalent to 5% of the world’s GDP** (**~ $3 trillion**) sustaining not just coast dwellers, **but almost 3 billion people worldwide**.
- The oceans generate **sustainable wave/tidal energy,** as well as key for the production of some commodities/medicine.
    - For instance, a shallow water sponge called **Tectitethya crypta** (in the Caribbean waters) is used to **fight leukaemia**.
- **More than half of the total amount of oxygen** is created by creatures in the ocean, which also **stores 50 times more CO2** than found in the atmosphere.

**How can we protect ocean ecosystems?**

- **Preventing bad fishing practices and processing, and building sustainable sewage systems** (80% of global wastewater is currently being diverted into oceans).
- **India’s approach to biodiversity management** is congruent with three globally accepted principles: **conservation, sustainable usage, and equitable benefit sharing.**
- **India’s legislative framework** – [the Biodiversity Act 2002](https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/biodiversity/)**,** Marine Protected Areas, Marine Genetic Resources, [Environmental Impact Assessment](https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/environment-impact-assessment/) – bears witness to these values.
- According to the UNEP, **international treaties** are one of the best ways to stop the destruction of oceans.
    - **For example,** the EU is pushing for the implementation of the historic [2022 Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/22/a-new-global-biodiversity-framework/)

**Conclusion:**

- The adoption of the BBNJ agreement is essential for the conservation and preservation of the oceans and their biodiversity, to ensure sustainable development.
- For this, **equitable benefit sharing, capacity building and transfer of marine technology** should be at the core.
- **If nothing changes, half of all sea dwellers will be critically endangered by the end of this century (UNESCO).**

### [India can become a biodiversity champion](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/23/india-can-become-a-biodiversity-champion/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Environment, Conservation**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/india-can-become-a-biodiversity-champion/article66541444.ece) 

**Context: India currently hosts 17% of the planet’s human population and 17% of the global area in biodiversity hotspots**, placing it at the helm to guide the planet in becoming **biodiversity champion**.

**Programmes launched in India towards biodiversity conservation:**

- [The Union Budget 2023](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/02/union-budget-2023-24/#:~:text=The%20total%20receipts%20other%20than,to%20be%209%25%20of%20GDP.)**:** It mentioned “**Green Growth**” as one of the seven priorities/**Saptarishis**.
- [The National Mission for a Green India](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/02/03/green-india-mission-2/)**:** It aims to increase forest cover on degraded lands and protect existing forested lands.
- **The Green Credit Programme:** It **incentivises environmentally sustainable and responsive actions** by companies, individuals and local bodies.
- [The Mangrove Initiative for Shoreline Habitats & Tangible Incomes (MISHTI)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/06/why-have-mangroves-got-a-budget-push/): It is significant because of the importance of mangroves and coastal ecosystems in mitigating climate change.
- **The PM Programme for Restoration, Awareness, Nourishment, and Amelioration of Mother Earth (PM-PRANAM):** It aims to reduce inputs of synthetic fertilisers and pesticides, which is critical for sustaining agriculture.
- **The Amrit Dharohar scheme:** It is expected to **encourage optimal use of wetlands** and enhance biodiversity, carbon stock, eco-tourism opportunities and income generation for local communities.
    - The recent intervention by the Union Ministry of Environment to stop the draining of [Haiderpur, a Ramsar wetland in UP](https://rsis.ramsar.org/ris/2463), to safeguard migratory waterfowl is encouraging.
- All the above initiatives are critical, as the country is facing **serious losses of natural assets such as soils, land, water, and biodiversity.**

**International initiative:**

- At the **UN Biodiversity Conference (2022**) in Montreal, Canada, 188 country representatives adopted an agreement known as the **30×30 pledge.**
- It aims to **“halt and reverse”** biodiversity loss **by conserving 30% of the world’s land and 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030.**

**Challenges faced by India:** Climate change → Global warming → Increases pest attack and diseases in crops/higher demands for water → reducing farm yields

**Way ahead for these programmes to address the current state of biodiversity:**

- **Evidence-based implementation:** It is critical not only for the success of these efforts but also for the documentation of **lessons learnt** for replication.
- **New programmes:** Should effectively use modern concepts of **sustainability and valuation of ecosystems** that consider **ecological-cultural-sociological aspects of our biological wealth**.
- **Reduction in water use in key sectors:** Such as agriculture by encouraging –
    - Changes to less-water-intensive crops such as millet
    - Investments in water recycling in urban areas using a combination of grey and blue-green infrastructure.
- **Ecological restoration rather than tree plantation:** As far as the Green India Mission is concerned, choosing sites to ensure **ecological connectivity in landscapes** fragmented by linear infrastructure.
- **Local community involvement:** Traditional knowledge and practices of these communities (local and nomadic) should be integrated into the implementation plans.
- **Each programme should include significant educational/research funding:** To critically appraise and bring awareness to India’s biological wealth.

**Conclusion:**

- The sum and variation of our biological wealth/biodiversity are essential to the future of this planet.
- With this in mind, the Indian govt. is planning to launch [the National Mission on Biodiversity and Human Wellbeing](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/06/07/insights-into-editorial-saving-biodiversity-securing-earths-future/) soon**,** using the power of interdisciplinary knowledge for greening India and its economy.

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus:** **Disaster Management**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/environment/new-policy-to-help-indian-communities-displaced-by-annual-river-coastal-erosion-drafted-87862)

**Context:** [The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/09/29/national-disaster-management-authority/) received the final inputs on the draft of **India’s first national policy** for the mitigation and rehabilitation of the people affected by river and coastal erosion.

**Background:**

- The Union Ministry of Home Affairs had directed NDMA to draft a policy based on the **15th** [**Finance Commission’s**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/functions-and-responsibilities-of-the-union-and-the-states-issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure-devolution-of-powers-and-finances-up-to-local-levels-and-challenges-therein/issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure/centre-state-relations/finance-commission/#:~:text=It%20is%20required%20to%20make,respective%20shares%20of%20such%20proceeds) report (2021).
- Until now, most policies in the country only address displacement after sudden rapid-onset [disasters](https://www.insightsonindia.com/disaster-management/) such as floods and cyclones.

**Highlights of the 15th Finance Commission’s report:**

- **It introduces mitigation measures** to prevent erosion under the National Disaster Mitigation Fund (NDMF), with an allocation of Rs 1,500 crore for 2021-26.
- **For the resettlement of displaced people** affected by erosion, it allocates R 1,000 crore for the same period under the [National Disaster Relief Fund (NDRF).](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/10/05/national-disaster-response-fund-ndrf/)
- The total allocation of Rs 2,500 crore, not just for structural (construction of sea walls and embankments) but also for non-structural solutions (rehabilitation), is a **national recognition of the problem**.
- For both funds, **state governments will have to avail resources** on a cost-sharing basis, contributing 25% (NE states – 10%) to the costs of mitigation and resettlement.
- **NDMA** will coordinate the allocations and expenses under NDRF and NDMF at the national level.
- **The states must follow timelines** for mitigation and rehabilitation projects without delays.

**Highlights of the NDMA’s draft policy:**

- It put in place some institutional mechanisms to manage displacement, which can be enacted under **the** [**Disaster Management Act 2005.**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/disaster-management/national-disaster-management-act-2005/)
- **Mapping** coastal and river erosion impacts and coming up with a database of diverse challenges confronted by the affected and vulnerable habitations.
- **District disaster management authorities (DDMA)** would be the **nodal agency** to implement the measures, aided by other district agencies and a specific panchayat-level committee.
    - The DDMA will prepare mitigation and rehabilitation plans → SDMAs → NDMA → the home ministry will approve the disbursal of funds.
    - **A qualified disaster management professional** must be included in all teams.
- Projects under NDRF and NDMF should be sanctioned in such a manner that they **can be completed within the award period** of the Commission.

**Concerns:**

- The policy considers only erosion-linked displacement, **but there is displacement owing to the deposition of eroded materials.**
- It is not clear **what the financial allocation** (on a first-come, first-serve/on population density basis) will be under the policy.

**Way ahead:**

- **Detailed hazard assessments** carried out by central agencies such as the National Centre for Coast Research, etc., be made available to the SDMAs.
- **Mapping of fallow areas** must be taken up for rehabilitation.
- These should be made available in **easy-to-access geographic information systems** (GIS) formats by the NDMA.

**Source:** [**TOI**](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-editorials/badministrators-nasty-social-media-brawl-between-ias-ips-officers-points-to-a-larger-worrying-trend/)**,** [**DNAIndia**](https://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-karnataka-ias-rohini-sindhuri-ips-d-roopa-moudgil-involved-in-ugly-feud-over-facebook-pictures-3025031)

 **Context**: Recently, an **IPS officer and an IAS officer** from Karnataka were involved in a **verbal debate on** **Social media** this has put the focus on a larger issue of how **civil service ethos is undergoing through participation in social media.**

**The issue of lowering the efficiency of Civil Servants:**

- **Less manpower:** The parliamentary standing committee said that there **are 22% fewer IAS** **officers in the country than** the sanctioned strength.
- **Not enough reforms and incentives:** The government’s lack of reforms in incentives and penalties have helped **incapacity, indifference, and corruption creep in.**
- Lack of **functional independence**
- **Social media addictions**: The self-aggrandizement stimulated **by social media addictions is a new challenge to the All India Services (Conduct) Rules, 1968.**
- **Unattractive private sector:** The private sector still isn’t attractive and big enough for breaking the charm of government services such as prestige, power, and job security.

[Ethical issues in Civil Servants](https://www.insightsonindia.com/ethics-integrity-and-aptitude/public-or-civil-service-values-and-ethics-in-public-administration/rules-as-source-of-ethical-guidance/) **using Social Media:**

- **Breach of neutrality**
- **Conflict of interest**
- **Misuse of official position**
- **Breach of confidentiality**
- **Inappropriate behaviour**
- **Risk to reputation**
- **Lack of accountability**

**How to tackle this issue:**

- **Training:** Civil servants should be provided with **training on the appropriate use of social media.**
- **Code of conduct**: A code of conduct should be **established for civil servants’ use of social media.**
- **Separation of personal and professional accounts**
- **Monitoring and enforcement**: Government departments should **monitor civil servants’ social media use and enforce the code of conduct**
- **Transparency and accountability**
- **Time management:** Civil servants should be provided with clear guidelines on the appropriate amount of **time that should be spent on social media and encouraged to prioritize their official duties.**

### **Right to Privacy of Children**

 **Source:** [TH](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/children-have-a-right-to-protect-their-genetic-information-from-dna-tests-sc-judgment/article66537446.ece)

**Context**: Supreme Court has held that children cannot be mechanically subjected to DNA tests to establish proof of infidelity.

**SC Observations:**

- **Genetic information is personal and intimate**: A child’s genetic information is part of his [fundamental right to privacy](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Right-to-Privacy-in-India.pdf)
    - **The right to Privacy** is an intrinsic part of the right to life and personal liberty under [**Article 21 (Puttaswamy Judgement).**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/08/27/puttaswamy-and-the-fading-promise-of-a-right/#:~:text=The%20right%20to%20Privacy%20is%20protected%20as%20an%20intrinsic%20part,Retd)%20vs%20Union%20of%20India.)
    - [**The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child**](https://www.unicef.org/child-rights-convention) also recognises the rights of privacy, autonomy and identity of children
- **Family courts** should direct a **DNA test to ascertain the paternity** of a child only as a last resort.

**Impact of such test:**

- Not knowing who one’s father is **creating mental trauma in a child**
- Allowing DNA tests would also **harm the reputation and dignity** of the mother

**What is a DNA paternity test?**

**A DNA paternity test uses DNA**, usually taken from a **cheek swab**, to determine whether a man is the child’s biological father.

- The lab compares the tissue samples from the mother, the child, and the man to see what special characteristics – **known as “genetic markers” –** the child shares with the mother and the man. These tests are very accurate in showing whether or not the man is the biological father of a child.

**Context**: The [National Commission for Scheduled Tribes](https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/issues-related-to-sc-st/national-commission-for-scheduled-tribes/) asked the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay why it allowed a counsellor with **“casteist sentiment**” to continue working with the SC/ST Cell on campus.

- Institute’s alleged failure to create safe spaces for marginalised students led to the alleged suicide of an 18-year-old Dalit student.

### **What is a ‘corrupt act’ according to RPA 1951?**

 **Source**: [IE](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/corrupt-act-representation-of-people-act-1951-8459915/)

**Context**: In (Anugrah Narayan Singh v. Harsh Vardhan Bajpayee) case, SC observed that providing false information about an electoral candidate’s qualifications cannot be considered a “corrupt **practice”** **under Sections 123 (2) and Section 123 (4) of the** [**Representation of People’s Act, 1951**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/governance/elections-in-india/acts-associated-with-elections-in-india/salient-features-of-the-representation-of-peoples-act-1951/)**.**

- Previously Allahabad High Court had **similarly dismissed the plea**, as a such defect in **disclosure was not of a substantial character** that could have materially prejudiced the prospects of the election

**About the case:**

Former Congress MLA Anugrah Narayan Singh said that BJP MLA Harsh Vardhan Bajpayee committed a “corrupt practice’ under **Section 123(2)** by **not disclosing his liabilities and correct educational qualifications** in his affidavit of nomination.

**About ‘Corrupt Practices’:**

[**The Representation of the People Act, 1951**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/governance/elections-in-india/acts-associated-with-elections-in-india/salient-features-of-the-representation-of-peoples-act-1951/) defines ‘corrupt practices’ to include bribery, undue influence, false information, and promotion of feelings of enmity or hatred between different classes of citizens of India on grounds of “**religion, race, caste, community, or language**” by a candidate for the furtherance of his prospects in the election.

- The Act also prohibits the **intentional publication of false statements** that can prejudice the outcome of an election.
- Past court rulings have held that **seeking votes in the name of a candidate’s religion, race, caste, community, or language** is a corrupt practice, while **promising freebies** cannot be termed as such.

**Context:** The **Singareni Thermal Power Plant (STPP) in Telangana** is set to become the **first public sector** **coal-based power generating** station in the South and first among the State PSUs in the country to have **flu gas desulphurization (FGD)** plant to meet the green norms by cutting sulphur dioxide emission to a safe level.

**About Flue Gas Desulfurization:**

- Flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) is a **set of technologies used to remove sulfur dioxide (SO2)** from exhaust flue gases of **fossil-fuel power plants** and from the emissions of other sulfur oxide emitting processes such as **waste incineration, petroleum refineries, cement and lime kilns.**

**Some methods of FGD**:

- **Wet scrubbing**using a slurry of alkaline sorbent, usually limestone or lime, or seawater to scrub gases;
- **Spray-dry scrubbing** using similar sorbent slurries;
- **Wet sulfuric acid process**recovering sulfur in the form of commercial quality sulfuric acid;
- **SNOX Flue gas desulfurization**removes sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulates from flue gases;
- **Dry sorbent injection systems** that introduce powdered hydrated lime (or other sorbent material) into exhaust ducts to eliminate SO2 and SO3 from process emissions

 **Context**: The **Kamioka Liquid Scintillator Antineutrino Detector** (KamLAND) experiment in **Japan** has found **no evidence that neutrinos are their own antiparticles**.

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/standard_mode.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/standard_mode.png)

**What are Anti particles?**

In particle physics, every type of particle is associated with an antiparticle with the same mass but with opposite physical charges. For example, the antiparticle of the electron is the positron.

- If a particle and its anti-particle meet, they will destroy each other in a flash of energy.
- **Neutrinos have anti-neutrinos** as antiparticles but since both don’t have any charge, it is really difficult to differentiate them.

**Significance of the findings:**

It can help to decipher the properties of Neutrinos, which can offer insight into the structure of the universe.
