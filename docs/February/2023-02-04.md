### [Parliament is ‘North Star’ of democracy, says Vice-President](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/04/parliament-is-north-star-of-democracy-says-vice-president/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Parliament – Structure, Functioning, Conduct of Business, Powers & Privileges and Issues Arising out of this/Separation of Powers**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/parliament-is-the-north-star-of-democracy-vice-president/article66467335.ece) 

**Direction:** The controversy over whether the [Basic Structure Doctrine](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/13/basic-structure-doctrine/) or Parliament is the “north star” of democracy is highlighted in the article.

**Context:** Stepping up the legislature versus judiciary debate, the Vice President and Rajya Sabha Chairman during the Parliament’s sitting stated that **Parliament is the “north star” of democracy.**

**Polaris/North Star** stays in roughly the same place in the sky – directly above Earth’s north pole, and therefore it’s a reliable way to find the direction of the north.

**Background:**

- This comes days after the CJI‘s statement, **calling the** [**basic structure**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/26/master-the-basic-structure-doctrine-for-upsc-cse-with-i-pen/) **doctrine a “north star”** that gives direction to interpreters and implementers of the Constitution.
- The VP has been **consistent in criticising the judiciary** for “overstepping its boundaries” and has also **questioned the landmark 1973** [**Kesavananda Bharati**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/04/28/basic-structure-and-the-kesavananda-bharati-case-2/) **case** verdict on the basic structure doctrine.
- According to the VP, the **verdict had set a “bad precedent”** and if any authority questions Parliament’s power to amend the Constitution, it would be difficult to say we are a democratic nation.

**Role of the** [**Parliament**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/parliament-and-state-legislatures/)**:**

- Parliament is the **essence of democracy** – participation by people in the decision-making process and government by consent.
- It is a place for **debate/discussion/deliberation** to realise the aspirations and dreams of the people.

**Functions:**

- To Select the National Government
- To Control, Guide and Inform the Government
- Law-Making

**Issues faced by the Indian Parliament:**

- While the Parliament’s productivity has gone up, it faces several challenges –
    - **Frequent disruptions**
    - Sharply dipping the number of bills being referred to parliamentary committees;
    - **Shrinking space for the opposition;**
    - Increasing recourse to ordinances; and
    - T**he bypassing of the Parliament** on several important initiatives.
- [**Judicial activism**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/structure-organization-and-functioning-of-the/judiciary/judicial-activism-and-judicial-over-reach/) or the judiciary’s proactive engagement in defending citizens’ rights, is a practice born out of the Indian Parliament’s inefficiency and inaction.
- As a result, there is debate over whether the Judiciary (SC, HCs) or Parliament should have the upper hand.

**Conclusion:**

The Parliament is the **essence** of democracy, while the basic structure doctrine is the **bedrock** and spirit of democracy and we all are **soldiers** of democracy. Therefore, all have a **defined role to play in a Parliamentary democracy like India.**

### [Poor literacy linked to worse mental health problems: Study](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/04/poor-literacy-linked-to-worse-mental-health-problems-study/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus:** **Issues relating to Education/Health/Poverty/Hunger**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/poor-literacy-linked-to-worse-mental-health-problems-study/article66439128.ece)

**Context:**

- According to a recent study in India, people with poor literacy face more mental health problems such as loneliness, depression and anxiety.
- It is the first such study to look at the **global picture of literacy and mental health.**

**Highlights of the study:**

- Despite rising literacy rates over the past 50 years, there are still an **estimated 773 million adults globally** who can’t read or write.
- Literacy rates are **lower in developing countries** and those with a history of conflict, and **women,** who account for two-thirds of the world’s illiterate, **are disproportionately affected**.
- **People with more literacy tend to have better social outcomes** in terms of finding employment, being paid well, and being able to afford better food and housing.
- Lower literacy is related to **poorer health, chronic diseases and shorter life expectancy.**
- Thus, little or no literacy **holds a person back** throughout their life and they often become trapped in **poverty or more likely to commit a crime**.

**Significant association between** [**mental health**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/02/sansad-tv-new-india-debate-mental-health/) **and** [**literacy**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-geography-2/indian-economic-and-human-geography/population-and-growth-trends-density-sex-ratio-literacy-tribes-and-racial-groups-in-india/literacy/)**:**

- People with **lower literacy had greater mental health difficulties** such as anxiety and depression.
- Literacy may be impacted by a number of factors, **such as** [**poverty**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-economy-3/poverty-and-unemployment/poverty/) **or living in a region with a history of conflict**, which can affect mental health.

### [Generative AI: What are the potential applications and ethical concerns?](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/04/generative-ai-what-are-the-potential-applications-and-ethical-concerns/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Source:** [**The Hindu**](https://www.thehindu.com/podcast/generative-ai-what-are-the-potential-applications-and-ethical-concerns-in-focus-podcast/article66408419.ece)**,** [**PIB**](https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1896016)

**Direction:** We had already covered [Generative AI previously](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/12/generative-ai/); the points given here are only the unique points that we didn’t cover previously.

**What is Generative AI:**

- Generative Artificial Intelligence refers to the **capability of artificial intelligence-enabled machines to use existing text, audio files, or images to create new content.**
- The software uses **complex machine learning models to predict the next word based on previous word sequences, or the next image based on words describing previous images**. “**Large language model”** – LLMs began at Google Brain in 2017, where they were initially used for the translation of words while preserving context.
- Since then, **large language and text-to-image models** have proliferated at leading tech firms including **Google (BERT and LaMDA), Facebook (OPT-175B, BlenderBot), and OpenAI, a nonprofit in which Microsoft is the dominant investor (GPT-3 for text, DALL-E2 for images, and Whisper for speech).**

**Benefits of** **Generative AI:**

- **Automated content generation**
- **Improved content quality**
- **Increased content variety**
- **Personalized content**

**Generative Adversarial Network:**

A generative adversarial network (GAN) is a **machine learning (ML) model** in which two **neural networks compete with each other** to become more accurate in their predictions. GANs typically run **unsupervised and use a cooperative zero-sum game framework to learn.**

[**Ethical concerns**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/03/19/insights-into-editorial-responsible-ai-the-need-for-ethical-guard-rails/) **associated with Generative AI:**

- **Bias and Discrimination**: AI models can perpetuate and amplify biases in their training data, leading to **discriminatory outcomes and unjust decisions**.
- **Responsibility and accountability**
- **Privacy:** Generative AI models have the **potential to collect and generate vast amounts of personal data, which can raise privacy concerns.**
- **Ownership and control**
- **Fairness and transparency**: AI models can make decisions **that lack transparency and fairness**.
- **Job displacement**
- **Misuse**: AI models can be used for **malicious purposes,** such as **creating fake news or deep fakes, or spreading hate speech.**
- Top of Form

**Indian Initiatives for Generative AI:**

- The Government has published the [**National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/National-Strategy-for-Artificial-Intelligence-AI.pdf) with the objective of **developing an ecosystem for the research and adoption of** [**Artificial Intelligence**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/science-technology/robotics/artificial-intelligence-and-robotics/)
- Subsequently with a vision **to ‘Make AI in India and Make AI work for India’,** MeitY has approved the implementation of the **‘National Program on Artificial Intelligence’** for the development of AI-based solutions and ensure responsible and transformational use of **#AI for All**.
- The Department of Science & Technology is implementing the [**National Mission on Interdisciplinary Cyber-Physical Systems**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/03/11/national-mission-on-interdisciplinary-cyber-physical-systems/) **(NM-ICPS)**.

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus:** **Indian Economy and Related Issue/Environment-Conservation**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/going-green-the-hindu-editorial-on-budget-2023s-and-indias-net-zero-commitment/article66467990.ece) 

**Direction:** The article covers initiatives taken by India to promote **Green Growth** & highlights proposals in the Union Budget in this regard.

**Context:** The Finance Minister’s latest [Union Budget 2023-24](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/02/budget-new-schemes-announced-and-old-schemes-emphasized/) has laid emphasis on the **government’s commitment to move towards net-zero carbon emission by 2070**.

**Background:**

- According to the World Economic Forum (WEF), **India holds the key to hitting global climate change targets given its sizeable and growing energy needs**.
- With the country’s **population set to overtake China’s** sometime this year, **India’s appetite for energy** to propel the economy is set to surge exponentially.
- **The transition to green alternatives** from the current reliance on fossil fuels is therefore an **urgent imperative**, as it creates **an opportunity** to launch new sectors and boost GDP.

**The Union Budget 2023-24 announcements:**

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/green.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/green.png)**

**Green Growth:**

- It is one of the **7 priorities (**[**Saptarishi**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/02/what-are-the-saptarishi-initiatives-for-amrit-kaal-announced-in-the-union-budget-2023-24-discuss-the-ways-in-which-the-country-can-achieve-green-growth-as-it-moves/) **of Amrit Kaal)** the Budget. India is implementing many programmes for –
    - [Green fuel](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/06/03/insights-editorial-analysis-green-hydrogen-fuel-of-the-future/), green energy, green farming, green mobility, [green buildings](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/02/17/what-are-green-buildings-do-you-think-innovation-in-green-buildings-can-help-address-the-carbon-challenge-and-harness-an-opportunity-for-sustainable-development-explain/), green equipment and policies for efficient use of energy across various economic sectors.
- These green growth efforts help in **reducing the carbon intensity of the economy and provide for large-scale green job opportunities.**

[**Electric vehicle (EV)**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Electric-Vehicles-in-India.pdf)**:**

- The availability of locally produced [**lithium-ion batteries**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/06/09/lithium/) has become essential, especially to reduce the cost of EVs.
- The Budget proposes –
    - **To exempt customs duty on the import** of capital goods and machinery required to manufacture lithium-ion cells.
    - The **establishment of a viability gap funding mechanism** to support the creation of battery energy storage systems with a capacity of 4,000 MWh.

**Energy storage systems:**

- Battery storage systems **help to ensure that the electricity produced at peak output** by wind and solar projects is stored and then supplied to match the demand.
- The Budget set aside a vital ₹8,300 crore towards a ₹20,700 crore project for building an **inter-State transmission system for the evacuation** and **grid integration** of 13 GW of renewable energy from **Ladakh**.
- The transmission line will help address hurdles in setting up solar capacity in the region, given its remoteness from India’s main power grid.

**India’s initiatives to promote green growth:**

  **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/NAPCC.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/NAPCC.png)**

**GS Paper 4**

**Direction:** These examples can be written in ethics/essay – how civil servants should act in any given situation.

### **SHO Anita Chauhan’s 10-min call that stopped Ghaziabad man’s Facebook Live suicide**

**Source:** [**The Print**](https://theprint.in/features/sho-anita-chauhans-10-min-call-that-stopped-ghaziabad-mans-facebook-live-suicide/1352425/#:~:text=She%20was%20near%20her%20station,preparing%20to%20die%20by%20suicide.)

**Context**:  Ghaziabad’s – **Vijay Nagar’s first woman SHO**, had **no prior experience counselling mentally ill people — she used common sense, kindness, and empathy**.

It was under extreme pressure that she convinced a youth to not end his life and that all the problems can be solved.

[**Ethical Values**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/ethics-integrity-and-aptitude/public-or-civil-service-values-and-ethics-in-public-administration/) **from this incident:**

- **Empathy & Compassion**: **concern and understanding for the man’s emotional state**.
- **Responsibility**: Took **personal responsibility to prevent suicide** and tried to intervene.
- **Commitment**: The SHO demonstrated a **commitment to preventing harm and saving lives, even in challenging circumstances.**
- **Leadership:** Understanding the situation she took prompt action.

### **Space Debris**

 **Source:** [**TOI**](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/111-payloads-105-space-debris-identified-as-indian-objects-orbiting-earth-space-minister/articleshow/97566102.cms) 

**Context:** A total of 111 payloads and 105 space debris identified as ‘Indian objects’ orbiting the Earth to date have been tracked (as per the US Space Command (USSPACECOM))

**What is** [**space debris**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/01/21/space-debris-3/#:~:text=What%20is%20Space%20Debris%3F,and%20climate%20monitoring%2C%20remote%20sensing.)**?**

Space debris is defunct human-made objects in space—principally in Earth orbit—which no longer serve a useful function

- The real amount of space debris is said to be **between 500,000 and one million pieces** as current sensor technology cannot detect smaller objects.
- They orbit at high speed in Low Earth Orbit (LEO)

**The threat of Kessler Syndrome?**

The Kessler Syndrome is a theoretical scenario in which Earth’s orbit is overpopulated with objects and debris, preventing the use of satellites in certain sections of Earth’s orbit.

**Measures taken** 

**Global:**

- Nasa’s Space Debris Sensor orbits the Earth on the International Space Station
- REMOVEdebris satellite
- Deorbit mission

**India:**

- Network for Space Objects Tracking and Analysis [(**NETRA) project**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/09/27/project-netra/)

### **With frigid innovation, scientists make a new form of ice**

**Source:** [**The Hindu**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/with-frigid-innovation-scientists-make-a-new-form-of-ice/article66467117.ece#:~:text=The%20researchers%20said%20they%20employed,like%20a%20fine%20white%20powder.)

**Context**: Scientists have **fashioned a previously unknown form of ice** – one that might **exist on our solar system’s icy moons** – in research that **sheds light on water’s behaviour under extreme conditions** using a **device that might be described as a super-duper cocktail shaker.**

**How was it made:**

- The researchers said they employed a **process called ball milling** to vigorously **shake ordinary ice** together **with steel balls in a container** cooled to **minus-328 degrees Fahrenheit** (minus-200 degrees Celsius).
- This yielded what they called **“medium-density amorphous ice,” or MDA, which looked like a fine white powder.**

 **Its characteristics:**

- Ordinary ice is crystalline in nature, with water molecules – two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, or H2O – arranged in a regular pattern. **Amorphous ice’s water molecules are in a disorganized form resembling a liquid.**
- Amorphous ice is **by far the most common form of water in space**. Scientists have identified 20 different forms of crystalline ice and **three forms of amorphous ice – one low density (discovered in the 1930s), one high density (discovered in the 1980s), and the new one in between**.
- Almost all ice in the **universe is amorphous and in a form called low-density amorphous ice**. This forms when water **condenses onto dust grains in space**. Comets are amorphous ice as well.

The **key significance of the discovery** of a new form of ice with a density similar to liquid water is that it could serve as an ideal model for understanding the properties of water without the complexities introduced by its fluid motion.

### **Current insight on the mechanisms of Cobra venom cytotoxins** **can help anti-venom therapy**

 **Source:** [**PIB**](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1895719) 

**Context:** Scientists have traced the **mechanisms of the toxic action of cobra venom**, paving a path towards **developing strategies for the application of antivenom** or small molecule inhibitors, which can **help mitigate the local toxic effects of cobra venom retained at the bite site.**

**About Cobras:**

- **Cobras (genus Naja**) are widely distributed over **Asia and Africa**, and cobra bites are responsible for large **mortality and morbidity**. Like other elapid venoms, **cobra venoms are neurotoxic in nature.** However, they also exhibit local **cytotoxic effects at the envenomed site**.
- Cytotoxins (CTXs) are an essential class of the **non-enzymatic three-finger toxin family** and are present in cobra venoms. **CTXs are also responsible for depolarizing neurons and heart muscle membranes.**

- A separate scheme for mangrove conservation, **‘Mangrove Initiative for Shoreline Habitats & Tangible Incomes’, (MISHTI)** was also announced as part of the **green growth priority of the Budget.**

**About Wetlands:**

- A broad definition of wetlands includes both **freshwater and marine and coastal ecosystems such as lakes and rivers, swamps and marshes, wet grasslands, peatlands, estuaries, tidal flats, mangroves, coral reefs, and all human-made sites such as fishponds, rice paddies, reservoirs, and saltpans**.

**Benefits of Wetlands:**

- Wetlands absorb **carbon dioxide and help slow global warming and reduce pollution**, hence, they are referred to as the **‘Kidneys of the Earth’.**
- Wetlands also provide a **buffer against the impacts of floods, droughts, hurricanes, and tsunamis, and build resilience to Climate Change**.
