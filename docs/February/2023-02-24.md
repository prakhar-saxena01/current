### [Does the anti-defection law need changes?](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/24/does-the-anti-defection-law-need-changes/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Indian Constitution- historical underpinnings, evolution, features, amendments, significant provisions and basic structure**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/does-the-anti-defection-law-need-changes/article66545080.ece)

 **Context:** Maharashtra political controversy cases that are currently pending before the SC will have wide consequences as they raise certain fundamental issues about the working of India’s “[anti-defection law](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/01/20/anti-defection-law-3/)”.

**Background:**

- Last year, the ruling **MVA** coalition lost power after an internal splintering of the Shiv Sena party.
- A faction then joined hands with the BJP to form the new ruling coalition and the disputes between the various parties have been continuing since then.

**The Tenth Schedule:**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|[Anti-defection law](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/04/25/anti-defection-law-5/)|**What leads to defection?**|**Deciding authority**|
|●        It **punishes** individual MPs/MLAs for **leaving one party for another** to bring stability to governments.<br><br>●        However, **it allows a group** (at least **2/3rd**) of MP/MLAs to join/merge with another political party without inviting the penalty for defection.<br><br>●        The Parliament of India added it to the Constitution as the Tenth Schedule in 1985 **(52nd Amendment)**.|●        When legislators are elected on the ticket of one political party –<br><br>○        **Voluntarily give up** membership of that party or<br><br>○        **Vote** in the legislature against the party’s wishes.<br><br>●        When **an independent** MP/MLA  **j**oins a party later.<br><br>●        A **nominated legislator** can join a political party within six months of being appointed to the House and not after such time.|●        The Presiding Officers of the Legislature – **Speaker, Chairman**.<br><br>●        However, **the law does not provide a time frame** within which the presiding officer has to decide a defection case<br><br>●        The SC held that, Ideally, the Speakers/Chairman should take a decision on a defection petition within **3** months.<br><br>●        Legislators can **challenge** the decisions before the higher judiciary.|

**The working of the** [10th Schedule](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/06/17/10th-schedule-of-the-constitution-5/)**:**

- Innumerable instances of governments being “toppled” mid-term.
- **Power-politics and intra-party dissent.**
- **Mass resignations** (instead of defections) to force a fresh election.
- Partisan actions by [State Governors](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/03/12/insights-into-editorial-the-office-of-the-governor/) with respect to swearing-in ceremonies and the timing of floor tests.
- Partisan actions by [Speakers](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/11/26/speaker-of-the-lok-sabha-2/) – refusing to decide disqualification petitions/acting in undue haste.
- In effect, the **10th Schedule has been reduced to a nullity**, governments that do not have clear majorities are vulnerable.

**The challenging task before the court:**

- **Has to adjudicate the actions of a number of constitutional functionaries**: Governors, Speakers, legislative party leaders, and elected representatives.
- It does not have the liberty of presuming dishonesty.
- It must maintain an **institutional arm’s-length** from the political actors and adjudicate according to legalities.

**SC’s judgments on defection:**

- In the **Kihoto Hollohan case (1992),** the SC upheld the sweeping discretion available to the Speaker in deciding cases of disqualification of MLAs.
- In the **Nabam Rebia judgment (2016),** the SC held that the Speaker cannot decide on a disqualification petition while a notice under Article 179(c) for the Speaker’s removal is pending.
- In the **Keisham Meghachandra case (2020)**,

**Conclusion**

The politicians are cunning enough to find loopholes in the 10th Schedule as well as the SC judgments. Therefore, the SC should not leave any stone unturned this time.

### [Giving data its due: National Data and Analytics Platform (NDAP)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/24/giving-data-its-due-national-data-and-analytics-platform-ndap/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Source**: [IE](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/parameswaran-iyer-and-v-anantha-nageswaran-write-giving-data-its-due-8461357/)

 **Context**: The government of India is drawing up a data ecosystem (through NDAP) thus enabling policy-makers and researchers to exploit the potential of public data

**About** [National Data & Analytics Platform (NDAP](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/01/29/with-data-being-the-new-oil-national-data-and-analytics-platform-will-work-to-democratize-access-to-publicly-available-government-data-elucidate/)) **(NDAP):**

The National Data & Analytics Platform (NDAP) was **launched in 2022 by NITI Aayog** in collaboration with different ministries and state governments in India.

- NDAP aims to **democratize access to public government data** by making it accessible, interoperable, interactive, and available on a user-friendly platform for various stakeholders such as policymakers, civil servants, university students and researchers, journalists, innovators, and civil society groups.
- It has been part of the **State Support Mission of NITI Aayog**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/NDAP.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/NDAP.png)

**Current Issues:**

- **Lack of uniformity in data format and no interoperability:** The need to bring NDAP arose because public **data in India was difficult to use**, and users couldn’t compare **data from different departments** or data gathered over time due to **differences in format and quality**.
- **Implications of rising digital Technologies**: The rise of data and digital technologies is rapidly transforming economies and societies, with enormous implications for governments’ daily operations.

**How NDAP solves these issues?**

NDAP solves these issues by providing a **user-friendly platform** that presents **standardized datasets from central and state government entities** and provides tools for **analytics and visualization.** 

**For example,** A state-level **civil servant building new primary health centres** can easily find and integrate three public datasets:

- **Health department’s Management Information System (MIS):** List of communities with existing PHCs
- **Economic Census from the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI):** To get a list of communities with private health facilities
- **The Population Census from the Registrar General of India (RGI):** To prioritize villages based on size

With NDAP, the decision-maker can **access the data from all three sources seamlessly** linked into a single dataset, saving time and effort. NDAP can leverage data to strengthen good governance by making it easier to access and analyze public data. 

**Significance of NDAP**

- **Enables linking and use of several types of data** at once.
- **The standardized dataset** enables merging and cross-sectoral analysis.
- **Simplifies the data** for it to be used by the government, academia, journalism, civil society, and the private sector
- **Customizes data** as per the need: Users can create flexible tables and visualizations
- **Quality benchmark datasets**: Data shown has to meet NDAP’s in-house 5-star rating framework.
- **Enables data-driven governance** and programme outcomes for the common public

**Other efforts:**

- The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology’s **policy around open data**
- **The** [**Open Government Data (OGD) Platform**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2018/06/13/insights-into-editorial-open-data-open-government/)India (by National Informatics Centre (NIC))
- [**National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP) 2012**](https://dst.gov.in/national-data-sharing-and-accessibility-policy-0): To provide proactive access to government-owned shareable data along with its usage information.
- India currently houses more than **1.****6 lakh data resources**and has published over **4,015 application programme interfaces (APIs)** from across 100-plus departments.

**Conclusion**

NDAP was developed in the [spirit of cooperative federalism](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/functions-and-responsibilities-of-the-union-and-the-states-issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure-devolution-of-powers-and-finances-up-to-local-levels-and-challenges-therein/issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure/cooperative-federalism/#:~:text=Cooperative%20federalism%20is%20the%20concept,problems%20with%20each%20other's'%20cooperation.&text=Coalition%20governments%3A%20It%20has%20increased%20states'%20bargaining%20power.), ensuring that all states are equal partners in the journey of becoming champions of data-driven policymaking. NDAP has now been included in the curriculum of **officer trainees at the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration,** Mussoorie. It will enable incoming government officers to develop a **data-driven decision-making mindset** from their first field job. Overall, NDAP has the potential to be an open data platform that can play a vital role in facilitating data-driven governance in India.

### [India’s R&D estimates are an incomplete picture](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/24/indias-rd-estimates-are-an-incomplete-picture/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus:** **Science and Technology**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/indias-rd-estimates-are-an-incomplete-picture/article66545931.ece)

 **Context:** India’s R&D expenditure-GDP ratio of 0.7% is very low when compared to major economies and is much below the world average of 1.8%.

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/India__spend.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/India__spend.png)

**Main reasons behind India’s low R&D expenditure-GDP ratio:**

- **Low investment by the corporate sector:** While the corporate sector accounts for about 2/3rd of gross domestic expenditure on R&D (GERD) in leading economies, **its share in India is just 37%.**
- **Low investment by MNCs: For example,** US-based MNCs spent $9.5 billion (₹649.7 billion) on R&D in India in 2018, which increased to $9.8 billion (₹690.2 billion) in the following year.

**Issues with the current system:**

- The National Science and Technology Management Information System (**NSTMIS**) of the DST is the agency that compiles GERD statistics in India.
- The NSTMIS relies on the **Department of Scientific and Industrial Research** (DSIR) list of recognised R&D units and the database of the Centre For Monitoring Indian Economy Pvt. Ltd. for this purpose.
- It is easier to gather information on R&D from the government sector, the higher education sector and public sector enterprises, **but not for the** **private corporate sector**.

**Key factors making the official R&D estimates grossly inadequate:**

- The DSIR list may not have many of the actual R&D performers since they may not be inclined to register themselves for two reasons:

**○             They consider government incentives are not attractive enough**

**○             Some firms are sensitive about sharing critical information**

- Some R&D firms in services such as software find it difficult **to meet the requirement of having separate infrastructure** for R&D to distinguish it from their usual business.
- Some of the leading Indian enterprises in new technology areas and foreign R&D centres are not covered.
    - **For example, SigTuple Technologies**, which is a leading start-up in India focusing on AI-based HealthTech, is unlisted in both databases.

**Way ahead for transforming India’s R&D statistics**:

- T**he NSTMIS should use the patents granted data**, in addition to its current method to identify R&D-performing enterprises.
- Annual R&D estimates can be prepared from **mandatory disclosures** that the enterprises are required to make to the **Ministry of Corporate Affairs.**
- **Technologies** can be used like in the case of revamped IT return forms where various sections are interlinked.
- **Proper disclosure** of information to regulatory agencies.

**GS Paper  3**

**Syllabus****: Science and Technology: Biotechnology**

**Source:** [Indian Express](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/hiv-cure-8462781/)**,** [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00479-2#:~:text=A%2053%2Dyear%2Dold%20man,stem%20cells%20from%20a%20donor.)

**Context**: The man referred to as the **“Dusseldorf patient**” became the third person to have been “[cured of HIV”](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/02/25/insights-into-editorial-a-miracle-cure-for-hiv/) after a **bone marrow transplant carrying a specific HIV-resistant – CCR5 delta 32 genetic mutation.**

**What is CCR5 mutation and how does it fight off HIV?**

- HIV mainly **targets and damages CD4 immune cells** in the body, reducing the body’s ability to defend against infections. The virus enters the **CD4 cells through CCR5 receptors** on their surface, but the **CCR5-delta 32 mutation prevents the formation of these receptors,** making it impossible for HIV to enter the cells. (Refer to the infographic given below)
- Only **1% of people worldwide have two copies of the CCR5-delta 32 mutation**, while 20% of people have **one copy of the mutation**, which is more common in those of European ancestry. People with the mutation are highly resistant to HIV infection.

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/HIV.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/HIV.png)

**Current treatments for HIV:**

- There are **no cures for the infection** at present, but the disease can be **managed using antiretroviral** **therapy**.
- These medicines **suppress the replication of the virus within the body**, allowing the number of **CD4 immune cells to bounce back**.
- If left untreated, **the virus destroys a person’s immune system and they are said to be in the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome stage (AIDS)** where they get several opportunistic infections that may result in death.

**Earlier works on the CCR5 gene:**

- A Chinese scientist edited the genomes of twins to remove this CCR5 gene in **an attempt to make them immune to HIV. Their father was living with HIV.**
- He faced immediate backlash from the scientific community and legal action. This is because guidelines for [genetic editing](https://www.insightsonindia.com/science-technology/biotechnology/gene-editing/#:~:text=Gene%20Editing%20is%20a%20type,insertions%20to%20site%20specific%20locations.) **prohibit germ-line editing** – **editing a genome that can be passed from one generation to the other** – as the editing techniques are not very precise and the long-term consequences of such editing are unknown.

### **Examples of Sustainability**

**Example 1:  Mud Brick Home**

**Jegatheesan A, a civil engineer from Tamil Nadu**, India, built a mud brick home called **‘Thaimann Veedu’** which means mother earth in Tamil, to preserve traditional mud houses and showcase their strength as a building material.

- He used **recycled materials such as wood and metals** for the construction of his sustainable home.
- The house is designed to **keep it cooler in summer and warmer in winter**, with breathable walls that **minimize the usage of ACs** or fans.
- The house also has a **20,000-litre rainwater harvesting tank**, a terrace garden, and an oxide floor.
- **Maximum use of Natural light**, hence reducing the cost of electricity bills to as low as Rs 20 or Rs 30 every two months.
- The 1,000 sqft two-storied house is made **without cutting even a single tree**, and all the window frames, doors, etc are made from **reused wood.**

**Example 2: Packaging** 

**Global beverage brand Pernod Ricard** in India announced in May 2022, the removal of **permanent mono-cartons** from their packaging.

- They have launched an **environment-first campaign #OneForOurPlanet** that is inspiring consumers to make eco-conscious purchase decisions about **Biodegradable packaging or no packaging** 

 **Usage: Both examples can be used for sustainable living and recycling.**

 **Context:** The Chief Justice of India (CJI) announced that the SC will adopt a “neutral citation system” for its judgments.

**What is a “citation”?**

- A case citation is essentially **an identification tag** for a judgment and it would contain a reference number, the year of the judgment, the name of the court, etc.
- **For example,** for the landmark Kesavananda Bharati case, the citation is AIR 1973 SC 1461.

**What is a neutral citation?**

- A neutral citation would mean that the court would assign **its own citation** (distinct from those given by traditional Law Reporters), enabling a uniform citation.
