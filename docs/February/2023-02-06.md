#### **GS Paper 1**

**Syllabus:** **Post-independence Consolidation and Reorganisation within the country**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/supreme-court-income-tax-order-on-sikkim-and-the-protests-it-has-triggered-8422930/)

**Direction:** The article highlights Section 10(26AAA) of the IT Act 1961 and how it **discriminates against women and outside Indians in Sikkim**.

**Context:**

- According to the CM of Sikkim, [a **review petition**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/09/01/what-is-a-review-petition-2/) has been filed in the Supreme Court for rectification of the court’s observation on Sikkimese Nepalis.
- Political parties in Sikkim have voiced opposition to the court’s finding that **Sikkimese Nepalis are immigrants** while granting income tax exemption (under Section 10(26AAA) of the IT Act 1961) to all long-term settlers regardless of ethnicity.

**Section 10 (26AAA)**

- The objective behind the section is t**o reduce the taxpayer’s burden by providing exemptions.**
- This section describes the income that does not form a part of the total income while calculating the tax for an individual/ **exempted income**.
- It was inserted **into the IT Act 1961 by the Finance Act 2008** with retrospective effect from April 1, 1990, the date on which the IT Act was made applicable in Sikkim.
- Before 1990, the **Sikkim Income Tax Manual** (SITM), promulgated by the Ruler of Sikkim or Chogya in 1948, was applicable.

**Why was it challenged?**

- The petitioners challenged the –
    - **Proviso** (a condition) **excluding Sikkimese women** married to non-Sikkimese men from the benefit of tax exemption.
    - **Explanation**, which elaborated on the type of income falling under the category, along with a **definition** of ‘Sikkimese’
- Under the Explanation to Section 10 (26AAA), **the definition of ‘Sikkimese’ is confined to** –
    - Individuals whose name is recorded in the **register** maintained under the Sikkim Subjects Regulation 1961, immediately before the 26th day of April 1975;
    - Individuals whose names were included in the Register of Sikkim Subjects by virtue of Government of India Orders 1990 and 1991; and
    - **Any individua**l whose name does not appear in the Register, but the name of such individual’s father/husband, etc., has been in the register.
- The Association of the Old Settlers of Sikkim **challenged the constitutional validity of the** **definition**, as it excluded Indians (from tax exemption benefits) who settled in Sikkim before April 26, 1975 – the day Parliament approved the merger of Sikkim with India.

**What is the SC’s ruling?**

- The benefit of tax exemption provided in Section 10 (26AAA) **shall be extended to all Indian citizens** domiciled in Sikkim on or before April 26, 1975.
- **The court struck down** the provision excluding Sikkimese women **as violative of** [**Articles 14, 15**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/indian-constitution/significant-provisions/fundamental-rights/fundamental-rights-articles-12-35/rights-to-equality/)**,** [**and 21**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/indian-constitution/significant-provisions/fundamental-rights/fundamental-rights-articles-12-35/rights-to-equality/) of the Constitution.
- A **woman is not a commodity** and has an identity of her own that cannot be taken away by marriage.
    - This is in line with what the SC had earlier ruled in **Sekar vs. Geetha & Ors** (2009).

**The court’s observations:**

- Under **the Sikkim Income Tax Manual 1948**, all persons engaged in business were subjected to tax irrespective of their origin.
- Therefore, there was **no difference made out** between the original inhabitants of Sikkim (the **Bhutia-Lepchas)** and the **persons of foreign origin** who settled in Sikkim (Nepalis) or **persons of Indian origin** who had settled down in Sikkim generations back.
- The judgement also recorded that the “Nepalese migrants”, were benefiting from **Section 10(26AAA) of the IT Act 1961**, while arbitrarily excluding settlers of Indian origin.

**GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus**: Indian Judiciary

 **Source**: [IE](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/supreme-court-73rd-anniversary-8424052/#:~:text=While%20the%20Supreme%20Court%20was,due%20to%20Sundaresh%20Menon's%20schedule.) 

**Context**: This year, the court is hosting the **first-ever celebration of its anniversary** with Singapore Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon as chief guest. The Supreme Court was established on **January 28, 1950**, two days after the Constitution.

**A brief overview of** [**India’s Supreme court**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/structure-organization-and-functioning-of-the/judiciary/sc/)**:**

The Supreme Court of India is the **highest judicial body** in the country and was established in 1950 after India gained independence from British rule. It evolved from the Federal Court of India, which was established in 1937.

**Most important judgements of** [**SC**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/structure-organization-and-functioning-of-the/judiciary/sc/)**:**

Source: Live Mint 

**How has the** [**Supreme Court**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/structure-organization-and-functioning-of-the/judiciary/sc/) **changed over the years?**

- **The number of judges**: The original Constitution **envisaged a Supreme Court**with a Chief Justice and **7 puisne judges** – leaving it to Parliament to increase this number.
    - Currently, there are **32 judges**(including the Chief Justice) (maximum possible strength is 34)
- **Sittings**: In the early years, all the judges of the Supreme Court sat together to hear the cases presented before them.
    - As the number of cases has increased, **the SC sit in smaller benches of two and three**– coming together in **larger benches of 5 and more** only when required to do so.
- **Expansion of its jurisdiction**: Over the years, the Supreme Court has expanded its jurisdiction, taking on an increasingly active role in **public interest litigation and providing judicial remedies** for a wide range of social and economic issues.

**Significance of SC:** 

- **Final appellate court**
- **Defender of the Constitution**: The Supreme Court is the ultimate interpreter of the Indian Constitution
- **Leader in the development of** [**public interest litigation**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Public-Interest-Litigation-PIL.pdf) in India, allowing citizens to bring cases to the court to address issues of public concern.
- **Political Stability**: It serves as a **check on the power of the government and other institutions,** helping to ensure political stability and the rule of law in the country
- **Defender of rights:** It has also established itself as a defender of the rights of marginalized groups, including women, children, and religious and ethnic minorities.

**Limitations of SC:** [Case backlog](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/19/editorial-analysis-indias-crushing-court-backlogs-out-of-the-box-reform/), [shortage of judges](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/05/sansad-tv-perspective-justice-delivery-system/#:~:text=Shortage%20of%20judges%3A%20around%2035,recommended%2050%20judges%20per%20million.), staff, and funding, Political pressure, and Difficulty in enforcing judgments.

### [Is Govt. on track with fiscal deficit targets?](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/06/is-govt-on-track-with-fiscal-deficit-targets/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus:** **Government Budgeting**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/explained-is-the-government-on-track-on-fiscal-deficit-targets/article66472080.ece#:~:text=The%20Government%20has%20not%20deviated,26%20from%20the%20current%206.4%25.) 

**Direction:** The article highlights how the [Union Budget 2023-24](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/02/union-budget-2023-24/) has tried to achieve [fiscal consolidation on one hand and economic recovery on another](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/17/editorial-analysis-balance-fiscal-consolidation-with-growth/).

**Context:**

- In the Union Budget for 2023-24, the Finance Minister chose the path of **relative fiscal prudence and projected a decline in** [**fiscal deficit**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-economy-3/fiscal-policy/deficit/types-of-deficit/#:~:text=Fiscal%20deficit%20indicates%20the%20additional,interest%20payment%20and%20loan%20repayment.) **to 5.9%** of GDP in FY24, compared with 6.4% in FY23.
- The government is planning to continue on the path of **fiscal consolidation** (reducing deficits) **and reach a fiscal deficit below 4.5% by 2025-26.**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/deficits.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/deficits.png)

**The Union Budget 2023-24:**

 **Different deficits:**

- The fiscal deficit (FD) is pegged at **5.****9%** of GDP in FY24, down from **6.4%** in 2022-23 (Revised Estimates – RE) and 6.7% in 2021-22 (actual).
    - To finance the FD in 2023-24, the net market borrowings from **dated securities** are estimated at ₹11.8 lakh crore.
    - The balance financing is expected to come from **small savings and other sources** and gross market borrowings are estimated at **₹15.4 lakh crore**.
    - It is also stated that the **states** will have to maintain a fiscal deficit of 3.5% of GSDP of which **0.****5%** will be tied to power sector reforms.
- The **revenue deficit** is pegged at 2.9% of GDP, down from 4.1% of GDP in 2022-23 (RE).
- The **primary deficit** is pegged at 2.3% of GDP, down from 3% of GDP in 2022-23 (RE).

**External debt:** India’s external debt is pegged at ₹22,118 crore of the total fiscal deficit of ₹17,86,816 crore in 2023-24 (Budget estimate – BE), which is approximately about 1%.

**Fiscal consolidation – Lowering food, fertiliser and petroleum subsidies**:

- The food subsidy has been reduced to ₹1,97,350 crore (BE) (from ₹2,87,194 crore in 2022-23 (RE)).
- The fertiliser subsidy has been reduced to ₹1,75,100 crore for FY24 (from ₹2,25,220 crore (RE)).
- The petroleum subsidy has declined to ₹2,257 crore in 2023-24 (from ₹9,171 crore (RE)).
- **The rationalisation of subsidies is important** so that the government can move towards reaching a fiscal deficit target of 4.5% by 2025-26.

**What needs to be done for reviving growth?**

- [**Inflation targeting**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-economy-3/inflation/#:~:text=Inflation%20targeting%20is%20a%20monetary,inflation%20target%20to%20the%20public.) **alone is not sufficient:** Given the supply-side shocks, the RBI’s interest rate management through inflation targeting is insufficient to successfully control inflation.
    - Also, a high-interest rate regime can hurt the economic growth process.
    - Therefore, [**fiscal policy**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-economy-3/fiscal-policy/deficit/types-of-deficit/) **measures are crucial to tackling mounting inflation.**
- **Fiscal policy needs to remain “accommodative”:**
    - This will go along with a focus on **gross capital formation** in the economy with enhanced capital spending, especially infrastructure investment.
    - In Budget 23-24, capital spending is expected to rise to 3.3% of GDP.
    - Infrastructure investment has a larger **multiplier effect** on economic growth and employment.
    - **The interest-free loan** of ₹1.3 lakh crore for 50 years provided to States should help them spend and boost growth.
- **Policy coordination:** Between RBI and the govt. is crucial for a sustained growth recovery process.

**Can the govt. stick to fiscal consolidation?**

- According to Moody, **the ambitious goal to reduce the deficit to 4.5% of GDP by FY26 is unlikely to be me**t, even when ongoing-gradual fiscal consolidation helps to stabilise the government’s debt burden and protects credit quality.
- According to Fitch Ratings, the slow fiscal consolidation process in the wake of the pandemic **could leave public finances exposed** in the event of further major economic shocks – geopolitical risks, mounting inflation, energy price volatility, etc.

**What lies ahead?**

- The Finance Minister is focusing on **economic growth recovery through capex,** as the **infrastructure investment will boost private investment**.
- In the fiscal deficit-GDP ratio, if the denominator GDP expands, it will reduce the overall fiscal deficit-GDP ratio.
- So the government is trying to maintain a **Goldilocks balance** (whereby the economy is not expanding/contracting by too much) between fiscal consolidation (reducing deficits) and economic growth recovery.

 **Direction:** We had already covered [Generative AI previously](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/12/generative-ai/); the points given here are only the unique points that we didn’t cover previously.

**What is Generative AI:**

- Generative Artificial Intelligence refers to the **capability of artificial intelligence-enabled machines to use existing text, audio files, or images to create new content.**
- The software uses **complex machine learning models to predict the next word based on previous word sequences, or the next image based on words describing previous images**. “**Large language model”** – LLMs began at Google Brain in 2017, where they were initially used for the translation of words while preserving context.
- Since then, **large language and text-to-image models** have proliferated at leading tech firms including **Google (BERT and LaMDA), Facebook (OPT-175B, BlenderBot), and OpenAI, a nonprofit in which Microsoft is the dominant investor (GPT-3 for text, DALL-E2 for images, and Whisper for speech).**

**Benefits of Generative AI:**

- **Automated content generation**
- **Improved content quality**
- **Increased content variety**
- **Personalized content**

**Generative Adversarial Network:**

A generative adversarial network (GAN) is a **machine learning (ML) model** in which two **neural networks compete with each other** to become more accurate in their predictions. GANs typically run **unsupervised and use a cooperative zero-sum game framework to learn.**

[**Ethical concerns**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/03/19/insights-into-editorial-responsible-ai-the-need-for-ethical-guard-rails/) **associated with Generative AI:**

- **Bias and Discrimination**: AI models can perpetuate and amplify biases in their training data, leading to **discriminatory outcomes and unjust decisions**.
- **Responsibility and accountability**
- **Privacy:** Generative AI models have the **potential to collect and generate vast amounts of personal data, which can raise privacy concerns.**
- **Ownership and control**
- **Fairness and transparency**: AI models can make decisions **that lack transparency and fairness**.
- **Job displacement**
- **Misuse**: AI models can be used for **malicious purposes,** such as **creating fake news or deep fakes, or spreading hate speech.**

**About** [**Mangroves**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/unique-ecosystems-degradation-and-management/mangrove-ecosystem/)**:**

- Mangroves are **salt-tolerant plant communities** found in **tropical and subtropical intertidal regions.** They are **important refuges of coastal biodiversity** and act as **bio-shields against extreme climatic events.** 
- They are located in the intermediate zone between the land and the sea and **represent one of the best examples of ecotone.**

**Threats to mangroves:**

- **Deforestation: Agriculture and aquaculture**, **urban development, and harvesting**have caused the loss of more than a quarter of mangrove forests.
- **Land reclamation for agriculture and industrial activities** has occurred in areas, which are under the **Coastal Regulation Zone.**
- Increasing **population in coastal areas**

### **Andhra’s Guaranteed Pension Scheme model**

**Direction**: For details about the [Old and New Pension scheme: Click here](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/15/beyond-ops-vs-nps-the-question-of-indias-broken-pension-system/)

**The issue with the** [**New Pension Scheme**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/15/beyond-ops-vs-nps-the-question-of-indias-broken-pension-system/): Employees who joined service post January 2004, and are part of the New Pension System have their contributions defined, but benefits depend on the market.

- On the other hand, the old pension scheme is **fiscally unsustainable**

**In the Andhra Pradesh model**: This model is it combines the elements of both the OPS (defined benefit) and the NPS (defined contribution). It gives two options to employees:

- **Option 1**: Employees can get a **guaranteed pension of 33 per cent** of their last drawn salary if they contribute **10 per cent of their basic salary** every month which is matched by a 10 per cent contribution by the state government.
- **Option 2:** Employees can get a **guaranteed pension of 40 per cent** of their last drawn salary if they are willing to **contribute a higher 14 per cent** of their salary every month, which will be matched by a 14 per cent government contribution.

**Usage:** This can be used as an example in governance questions to give a solution to the Old Pension Vs New Pension debate

### **Quotes: On Sports:**

- _“Sports is finally being viewed from the athletes’ perspective and not from the government’s”_
- _“Sports is not just a genre, but an industry”_

**Initiatives in Sports:** TOPS (Target Olympic Podium Scheme); Sports Budget (tripled in last 7 years); Khelo India campaign; National Sports Development Fund; Mission Olympics 2024; Fit India Movement

### **Data point: Electorates in India**

India has witnessed a nearly **six-fold increase** in the total number of voters since 1951 to over **94.50 crores** this year

- **In the last Lok Sabha polls** voter turnout was over **67 per cent** – the highest ever, as well as the highest ever participation by **women voters**
- **Missing Voters (almost 33%)**: Mostly people from urban areas, youth and migrants
- In 1951, India had **17.****32 crore** registered electors and nearly **45%** had turned up to exercise their franchise.

**Context:** Founded by [**Rabindranath Tagore**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/05/07/gurudev-rabindranath-tagore/) **in 1921**, Visva-Bharati University will soon get the ‘**heritage’ tag from** [**UNESCO**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/international-relations/important-international-institutions-agencies-and-further-structure-mandate-etc/un/unesco/) **to take the distinction of world’s first living heritage university.**

- Normally [heritage tag](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/05/20/unesco-world-heritage-sites-3/) is given to a dead monument. For the first time in the world, **a living university, which is functioning, is going to get the heritage tag from UNESCO.** 

**About Visva Bharati University:**

- When founded in 1921 it was named after **Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore** **until the Visva-Bharati Society was registered as an organization in May 1922**.
- In 1922, Visva-Bharati was inaugurated as a **Centre for Culture with an exploration into the arts, language, humanities, and music** and these are reflected in diverse institutes that continue in their educational programmes.

### **What is the North Star?**

**Source:** [**Indian Express**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/vp-dhankar-parliament-north-star-8424016/)

 **Context**: Recently ‘North Star’ has been in news from the political context

**What is North Star?** 

**Polaris, also known as the North Star or the Pole Star,** is a very bright star (around 2500 times more luminous than our sun) placed less than 1° away from the north celestial pole.

- Its position and brightness have made humans use it for navigation since late antiquity. It is a part of the constellation **Ursa Minor and is around 323 light-years away from Earth.**
- Since Polaris lies nearly in a direct line with the Earth’s rotational axis “above” the North Pole, it stands **almost motionless in the night sky,** with all the stars of the northern sky appearing to rotate around it. **This makes it an excellent fixed point from which to draw measurements for celestial navigation**.

**Does the Northern Star “change”?**

The northern celestial pole changes over time. “If you picture a line connecting Earth’s North and South Poles as the axis around which Earth rotates, **that axis is slowly moving in its own circle”.** Over a period of around 26,000 years, **the Earth’s axis completes one full rotation**.

- By the end of the 21st century, **the celestial pole will move away from Polaris – humans will need to identify a new ‘North Star’**

Meaning of **“**[**parliament**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/parliament-and-state-legislatures/) **is the North Star of democracy”:** It is the **institution that guides democratic functioning, that dictates the direction a democracy takes**.

- Since it represents the ‘**will of the people’**, many political thinkers have always felt that as an institution, the parliament is the most fundamental in a democracy.
- For CJI Chandrachud, North Star is the [basic structure doctrine .](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/indian-constitution/basic-structure-doctrine/)

- **The banking sector remains resilient and stable**: Various parameters relating to capital adequacy, asset quality, liquidity, provision coverage and profitability are healthy.
- Banks are also in compliance with the **Large Exposure Framework (LEF) guidelines** issued by the RBI

**What are the Large Exposure Framework (LEF) guidelines?**

LEF are guidelines aimed to **monitor and limit losses of a bank** from a client or corporation. It is based on the 2014 Basel guidelines.

- **An exception to LEF**: Banks need not report exposure if the loans are taken from RBI, is guaranteed by the Government of India or have Intra-day interbank exposures or deposits are maintained by NABARD (due to shortfall in target for [Priority sector Lending](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/08/07/priority-sector-lending-psl/))

### **Scientists use outer space particles to examine the fortress wall of Xi’an city**

 **Source:** [**Indian Express**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/scientists-outer-space-particles-xian-city-fortress-muons-8423710/)

 **Context**: Researchers are using **muons** to study the fortress wall of Xi’an, an ancient city in China. **Muons have revealed small density anomalies, which may pose safety risks**, within the wall.

- Researchers deployed a technique called **muon tomography or muography, which uses muons to generate three-dimensional images of such large structures.**

**What are** [**muons**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/04/14/insights-into-editorial-muon-g-2-landmark-study-challenges-rulebook-of-particle-physics/)**?**

Muons are [**subatomic particles**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/06/explain-the-various-types-of-subatomic-particles-that-make-up-an-atom-what-are-the-technological-applications-of-cosmic-ray-muons/) **raining from space**. They are created when the particles in Earth’s atmosphere **collide with cosmic rays** — clusters of high-energy particles that move through space at just below the speed of light. According to **Scientific American magazine, “about 10,000 muons reach every square meter of the Earth’s surface a minute”.**

**What is muon tomography or muography?**

Muography is conceptually similar to **X-ray but capable of scanning much larger and wider structures,** owing to the **penetration power of muons**.

**Applications of Muography:**

- **Muons and archaeology:** In 2017, modern archaeologists repeated the experiment with more sophisticated and **advanced muon detectors and stumbled upon a major finding.**
- **CORMIS** (**Cosmic Ray Muon Imaging System**), to examine the wall of Xi’an city

    - It also includes a “**Critical Raw Materials Act**”, which will provide access to materials like [rare earth](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/12/13/rare-earth-elements/) that are crucial for developing [net-zero](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/04/going-green-on-budget-2023s-and-indias-net-zero-commitment/)
- **Providing faster access to funds:** According to the proposal, state aid rules will be loosened in order to help the EU’s 27 governments with investing in clean energy projects.
    - There is also a provision for setting up a “**European Sovereignty Fund**” in the future to “give a structural answer to the investment needs”.
- **Enhancing skills:** The plan aims to establish **“Net-Zero Industry Academies”** that will provide up-skilling and re-skilling programmes in strategic industries.
- **Improving the trade network**: The plan underlines the importance of **open trade and seeks to further “develop the EU’s network of Free Trade Agreements and other forms of cooperation with partners to support the green transition.”**
