#### **GS Paper 1**

**Syllabus:** **Disaster Management/Geography**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/climate-change/himalayan-plunder-3-million-indians-live-in-areas-that-can-be-swept-by-glacial-lake-floods-says-study-87593#:~:text=Published%3A%20Thursday%2009%20February%202023&text=Three%20million%20Indians%20live%20in,worldwide%20facing%20such%20a%20risk.)

 **C****ontext:** The article highlights GLOF, associated risks and risk mitigation.

**What is a** [**GLOF**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Tackling-Glacial-Burst.pdf)**?**

- A [GLOF](https://www.un-spider.org/category/disaster-type/glacial-lake-outburst) is a **sudden release of water from a lake fed by glacier melt**
- Threatens people’s lives, livelihoods and regional infrastructure.
- In the Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH), GLOF events can be traced back to the **failure of moraine-dammed glacial lakes**
- The pressure on the dam, water seeping through the structure, fragmentation of the source glacier, **landslides**, etc., can trigger a GLOF.
- The frequency of GLOFs is expected to increase due to [**climate change**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/climate-change-and-associated-issues/)**.**

**Recent findings:**

- The majority of the globally exposed population is **located in the region of high mountain Asia** and more than 50% in **India, Pakistan, Peru and China.**
- The population exposed to [GLOFs](https://www.icimod.org/mountain/glacial-lake-outburst-flood/) **increases with distance from a glacial lake.**
- **Rapid deglaciation** over the last 20 years has led to the growth of many large glacial lakes.
- **Increase in the population** living in close proximity to glacial lakes between 2002 to 2022.

**Situation in India:**

- **According to the ICIMOD**, Himalayan glacial lakes increased by about 9% in number, and 14% in the area.
- **The best-studied glacier** is north India’s **Chhota Shigri**, which has lost three times its mass.
- The rapid onset of GLOFs means **there is insufficient time to effectively warn downstream populations.**

**Way ahead:**

- **Studying glaciers** through satellite observations.
- **Learning past events and their dynamics** will help in [disaster risk reduction](https://www.insightsonindia.com/disaster-management/) and [climate change adaptation](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2018/02/21/insights-editorial-adapting-better-climate-change/) in the region.

**Conclusion:** Improvements are urgently needed in designing **early warning systems** alongside **evacuation drills** and other forms of **community outreach.**

### [What is Article 356](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/10/what-is-article-356/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus: Polity**

**Source:** [**Indian Express**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/pm-modi-indira-gandhi-misused-article-356-8434716/)**,** [**First Post**](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/what-is-article-356-which-pm-says-indira-gandhi-misused-50-times-12132492.html)

**Context:** Recently Prime Minister mentioned the **misuse of Article 356 in the parliament.**

- Commonly known as [**President’s Rule**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/indian-constitution/significant-provisions/emergency-provisions/presidents-rule/), [Article 356](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/04/01/imposition-of-article-356-2/) **allows the president to assume any and all functions of the state**.

**About Article 356:**

- **Section 93 of the** [**Government of India Act, 1935**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/indian-constitution/historical-underpinnings-and-evolution/crown-rule-1858-1947/government-of-india-act-of-1935/#:~:text=It%20provided%20for%20the%20establishment,list%20and%20the%20concurrent%20list.)
- Also called a ‘**State Emergency’ or ‘Constitutional Emergency’.**
- It deals with the ‘**failure of constitutional machinery in the state’** and allows the president to assume any and all functions of the state.
- It can be **imposed for six months at a time for a maximum duration of three years.**
- After six months, **Parliament’s approval is needed to reimpose President’s Rule**.
- In 1978, the **44th Amendment to the Constitution (1978**) was made.
- This stated that President’s Rule cannot be extended beyond one year unless:
    - In case of a **national emergency**
    - The **Election Commission of India certifies** that it is necessary due to difficulties in conducting Assembly polls.

After President’s Rule is imposed, the **governor of the state continues administering the state** on behalf of the president. The governor can also take aid from the chief secretary and any other officials.

**Issues with the use of Article 356:**

- **Overuse and abuse in a politically motivated manner**, especially by the central government to dismiss state governments run by opposition parties.
- **Subversion of democracy**: It suspends the democratic process in a state
- **Lack of accountability:** The frequent use of Article 356 has been seen as an infringement on the federal principles of the Indian Constitution and a diminution of the powers of the states.
- **Negative impact on governance**: It can lead to administrative and governance breakdowns in a state

**Recommendations to avoid misuse:**

- The [**Sarkaria Commission in 1983**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/functions-and-responsibilities-of-the-union-and-the-states-issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure-devolution-of-powers-and-finances-up-to-local-levels-and-challenges-therein/issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure/centre-state-relations/recent-trends/) recommended it **only be used in extreme cases**.
- The Supreme Court in the landmark [**1994 Bommai vs Union of India case**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2018/05/19/3-bommai-case-is-one-of-the-most-quoted-verdicts-in-the-countrys-political-history-discuss-its-verdict-and-its-implications-250-words/), dealing with **Article 356 outlined strict guidelines on dealing with the dismissal of a state government.**
- For one, it made it mandatory for a **no-confidence motion to be passed in the House**.
- It also made **President’s Rule subject to** [**judicial review**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/structure-organization-and-functioning-of-the/judiciary/judicial-review/#:~:text=Judicial%20review%20is%20the%20power,challenged%20by%20the%20affected%20person.).
- The court held that Article 356 can be invoked in situations of the **physical breakdown of the government or when there is a ‘hung assembly**’, but that it **cannot be used** without giving the state government a **chance to either prove its majority in the House or without instances of a violent breakdown of the constitutional machinery.**

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus**: Biotechnology-related issues.

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/world/rise-of-amr-could-result-in-up-to-10-million-annual-deaths-by-2050-un-report-87544#:~:text=The%20dangerous%20rise%20of%20antimicrobial,February%207%2C%202023%2C%20noted.)**,** [**UNEP**](https://www.unep.org/resources/superbugs/environmental-action)

 **Context:** UNEP released a new report – **Bracing for Superbugs: Strengthening environmental action in the One Health** **response to antimicrobial resistance**.

- It provides evidence that the **environment plays a key role in the development, transmission, and spread of** [Anti-Microbial Resistance (AMR).](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/02/antimicrobial-resistance-heres-what-can-be-done-to-address-environmental-amr-in-india/) 

**About AMR:**

- **Antimicrobials** are agents **intended to kill or inhibit the growth of microorganisms**. They include antibiotics, fungicides, antiviral agents, and parasiticides.
- AMR occurs when **microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, parasites, or fung**i become **resistant to antimicrobial treatments** to which they were previously susceptible.

**Key findings of the report:**

- Up to **10 million deaths could occur annually by 2050 due to antimicrobial resistance (AMR**), on par with the 2020 rate of global deaths from cancer.
- **Pollution in key sectors of the economy** contributes to the development, transmission, and spread of AMR.
- AMR’s economic toll could result in a **GDP drop of at least USD 3.4 trillion annually by 2030,** pushing 24 million more people into extreme poverty
- Microorganisms (particularly bacteria) **can acquire resistance following contact with resistant microorganisms**.
- AMR challenges are li**nked to the** [**triple planetary crisis**](https://unfccc.int/blog/what-is-the-triple-planetary-crisis) **of climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution and waste.**
- Three key sectors of AMR development and spread in the environment: **Pharmaceuticals and other chemical manufacturing, agriculture and food production, and Healthcare.**

**Suggestions in the report:**

- Create **robust and coherent national-level governance, planning, regulatory and legal frameworks**.
- **Increase** [**global efforts**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/06/03/tackling-antimicrobial-resistance/) **to improve integrated water management and promote water, sanitation, and hygiene to limit the development and spread of AMR**.
- **Increase integration of environmental considerations into AMR National Action Plans**.
- **Establish international standards** for what constitutes a good microbiological indicator of AMR
- **Environmental monitoring and surveillance**
- AMR requires a [**One Health**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/06/17/the-one-health-concept/) **response** that recognizes that the **health of people, animals, plants, and the environment are closely linked and interdependent.**

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus:** **Environment, Conservation**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/world/poor-of-a-country-emit-less-lose-more-new-paper-calls-for-progressive-taxes-for-polluting-elites--87552) 

**Context:** According to the **Climate Inequality Report 2023**, [low and middle-income countries are disproportionately impacted](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/social-dimensions-of-climate-change#:~:text=As%20the%20impacts%20of%20climate,identity%2C%20and%20other%20related%20risks.) by [climate change](https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/climate-change-and-associated-issues/) even though they emit less GHGs than their richer counterparts.

**Findings of the report:**

- **48% of emissions are from the top 10% of emitters**, having 76% capacity to finance and their relative loss is a mere 3% from climate change.
- **The global bottom (50%) has only a 2% capacity to invest**, with an emission of 12% and a massive relative loss of 75%.
- **Climate change contributes to economic destitution** in subtropical and tropical countries. For instance, it reduces agricultural productivity in poorer nations while increasing it in some temperate nations.
- **Climate change also has adverse effects on mental health.** For example, a 1 degree Celsius increase in monthly average temperatures increases suicide rates by 2.1% in Mexico.

**Suggestions in the report:**

- **The wealthiest individuals** (**0.001%** of the world’s adult population) with over $100 million should pay a ‘**progressive tax**’ ranging from **1.5-3%** of their fortune **to help less fortunate people adapt** to global warming and crisis.
- Combating global poverty need not overshoot global carbon budgets to meet the [Paris Agreement](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/07/08/financial-and-technological-commitments-under-unfccc-and-paris-agreement/)
- **Redistribution measures** to combine poverty alleviation and climate change mitigation efforts.
- Emerging economies like China carry increased responsibility to produce transparent strategies for reaching [**Net Zero emissions**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/08/27/india-needs-a-10-tn-investment-for-reaching-the-net-zero-emission-target-by-2070/)**.**

**Conclusion:**

- The need for a just transition to a low-carbon economy reflects **unequal responsibility** for causing the climate crisis and **uneven capacity** to help address it.
- Not only countries but also individuals have **different responsibilities** [**(**common but differentiated responsibilities](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/11/28/common-but-differentiated-responsibilities-and-respective-capabilities-cbdr-rc/)**) toward combating climate change** and ensuring [**climate justice.**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/03/15/insights-into-editorial-working-towards-climate-justice-in-a-non-ideal-world/)

### [All governments are crony capitalists](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/10/all-governments-are-crony-capitalists/)

#### **GS Paper 4**

**Source:** [**BS**](https://www.business-standard.com/article/opinion/all-governments-are-crony-capitalists-123020801846_1.html)

 **Context:** The recent Hindenburg report on the Adani group and instances of **business-political nexus** have highlighted the term ‘**crony capitalists’**

**What is** [**Crony capitalism**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2015/02/08/the-big-picture-threat-of-crony-capitalism-can-it-be-curbed/)**?** 

A political-economic system in which success in business depends on close relationships between **business people and government officials**, rather than on merit and competition

**Examples of** **Crony capitalism:**

- **India**: Adani Group (CAG report highlighted “undue benefits” that the Gujarat government gave to Adani Ports by waiving waterfront and other charges); The 2G spectrum scam; Coalgate Scandal etc.
- **Russia**: Privatization of state-owned assets in the 1990s resulted in a small group of **oligarchs** acquiring significant wealth and political power
- **USA**: The 2008 financial crisis: Several large banks received government bailouts
- **China**: State-owned enterprises (SOEs) receive preferential treatment

**Reason for high crony capitalism in India**:

- **Weak governance and lack of transparency** in the political and bureaucratic systems
- **Corruption**
- **Lack of competition** in the business sector dominated by a few large conglomerates
- Influence of money and power where **financial resources shape government policies**
- **Weak legal and regulatory frameworks** with slow and inefficient courts
- **Weak enforcement** of laws and regulations.
- **Complex rules** and regulations

**Ethical issues with Crony Capitalism:**

- **Corruption**: It undermines the **integrity of public institutions** and **erodes trust** in the democratic process.
- **Inequality**: It creates a **two-tiered system** and exacerbates income and wealth inequality, contributing to social injustice.
- **Reduced Competition:** It stifles innovation, reduces economic growth, and limits opportunities for small businesses and entrepreneurs.
- **Lack of Social Responsibility**: Crony capitalists often prioritize their own self-interest over the well-being of society.
- **Not good for democracy:** Crony capitalists influence the political results and undermine the democratic process and erode the separation of powers.

**Safeguards:**

**Uday Kotak Committee recommendations against Crony Capitalism:**

- **Transparency in related-party transactions** through complete disclosure
- **Independent directors**: Companies should have a minimum of **50% independent directors**
- **Enhanced role of audit committees**
- **Strengthening the corporate governance framework**

**Other measures needed:**

- Transparency and disclosure of political contributions
- Regulation of lobbying activities
- [Election Campaign finance reform](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Election-Campaign-Funding.pdf)
- Reform of government procurement practices e.g., the [GeMS portal](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/06/02/government-e-marketplace-gem-4/)

**Ethics and Business**

**Source**: [**The Statesman**](https://www.thestatesman.com/opinion/ethics-and-business-i-1503153524.html)**,** [**BS**](https://www.tbsnews.net/thoughts/value-business-ethics-why-companies-must-prioritise-integrity-and-transparency)

**What is Business ethics?**

It refers to a collection of values and concepts that guide how businesses should conduct themselves and engage with stakeholders.

The world today is facing numerous negative issues such as widespread corruption, greed, violence, poverty, and environmental destruction.

**The root cause of these issues:**

- **Erosion of moral values and ethics**, resulting in an unprecedented trust deficit.
- **Globalization and technological developments** have sped up this process

Businesses have enormous potential to contribute to society but are also capable of causing harm through exploitation, corruption, and unethical practices.

**Some examples of unethical practices of corporates are:**

- **Accounting and Financial Information**: Creative accounting, tax evasion, insider trading, securities fraud, forex scams, bribery, kickbacks, facilitation payments,
- **Human Resource Development (HRD):** discrimination ~ age, gender, race, religion; at-will employment, surveillance, sexual harassment and whistle-blowing.
- **Sales and Marketing**: Price fixing, anti-competitive practices, anti-trust laws, greenwashing, etc.
- **Production**: Addictive, defective, inherently dangerous products
- **Intellectual Property**: Patent infringement, bio-prospecting, bio-piracy, hijacking of traditional intellectual properties like Ayurvedic medicines
- **International Trade:** Unfair trade, dumping, outsourcing to the cheapest destinations, globalization, economic and cultural imperialism, child labour, etc.
- **General Corporate Philosophy**: Stockholder vs. stakeholder concept, corporate governance and corporate social responsibility, industrial espionage, political contributions, and corporate manslaughter.

**Solutions:**

- Develop a code of ethics
- Provide ethical decision-making training
- Cultivate an ethical environment
- Hold employees accountable for their actions

**Case Study**: **Tata group** prioritize **ethics and integrity over profit** and has earned the respect and trust of its stakeholders, increased its profitability, and contributes to a more sustainable and prosperous future for all.

### **Nord Stream gas pipelines**

 **Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/us-bombed-nord-stream-pipelines-who-is-seymour-hersh-8435031/)

 **Context:** According to a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) carried out the bombing of the [Nord Stream pipelines](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/10/03/what-happened-to-the-nord-stream-pipelines/) on orders from the United States.

**Impact of the bombing**: It led to Energy supply disruption in the EU; heightened geopolitical tension between Russia and the USA & EU; and created environmental issues due to the gas leak

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/nord_s.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/nord_s.png)** 

**Nord Stream (literally ‘North Stream’):**

- It is a network of offshore **natural gas pipelines** in Europe which run under the Baltic Sea from **Russia to Germany.**

**The three major forms of treatment for any cancer:**

- **Surgery** (removing cancer)
- **Radiotherapy** (delivering ionising radiation to the tumour)
- **Systemic therapy** (administering medicines that act on the tumour)
    - **Chemotherapy** (a **medicine used to kill cancer cells): However, it has various side effects.**
    - **Immunotherapy** (the drugs bind to specific targets on cancer and kill it): However, it is effective only against tumours that express these targets.
    - **CAR T-Cell Therapy**

### **Dwarf planet Quaoar**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/astronomers-astonished-by-ring-around-frigid-distant-world-quaoar/article66488828.ece#:~:text=Researchers%20said%20on%20Wednesday%20they,current%20scientific%20understanding%20would%20allow.)

 **Context:** A ring has been detected around Quaoar by the European Space Agency’s Cheops telescope, similar to Saturn’s ring.

 **Quaoar:**  

- Discovered in 2002, it is **a dwarf planet** in the **Kuiper belt**, a region of icy planetesimals beyond Neptune.
- Its diameter of about 700 miles is **a third that of Earth’s moon and half that of the dwarf planet Pluto**. It has a small moon called **Weywot**.

**Why is a ring around Quaoar unusual?** 

Quaoar is located outside the **Roche limit –** where particles **should readily come together** (due to gravitational field) around a celestial body to form a **moon**.

Ring system in our solar system:

- The greatest ring system in our solar system is found on **Saturn**.
- The **non-planetary bodies** Chariklo and Haumea, as well as the **other giant gas planets Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune**.
- They all fall within the Roche limit.

**About Dickinsonia:**

- It is considered to be Earth’s oldest animal
- It is an **extinc**t genus of **basal animal** (animals which have radial symmetry in their body)
- The animal is **considered a link** between early simple organisms and then the explosion of life in the [Cambrian Period](https://www.insightsonindia.com/world-geography/physical-geography-of-the-world/origin-and-evolution-of-universe-solar-system/geological-time-scale/eras/the-paleozoic-era/)
- Previously, fossils of Dickinsonia have been found in Australia, Russia, Ukraine, China

**About** [**Bhimbetka Rock Shelters**](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/925/) **caves** 

It is a **UNESCO World Heritage Site** with evidence of human habitation dating back to about 1 lakh years.
