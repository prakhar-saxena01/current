 **Context**:  An intensive study of **Earth’s deep interior**, based on the **behaviour of** [seismic waves](https://www.insightsonindia.com/world-geography/physical-geography-of-the-world/geomorphology/internal-forces-their-impact/earthquakes/earthquake-waves/) from large [earthquakes](https://www.insightsonindia.com/world-geography/physical-geography-of-the-world/geomorphology/internal-forces-their-impact/earthquakes/earthquake-waves/), confirmed the existence of a **distinct structure inside our planet’s inner core** – **a hot innermost solid ball of iron and nickel about 800 miles (1,350 km) wide.**

[Layers of the Earth:](https://www.insightsonindia.com/world-geography/physical-geography-of-the-world/geomorphology/interior-structure-of-the-earth/layers-of-the-earth/)

- The planet’s internal structure comprises four layers: **a rocky crust on the outside, then a rocky mantle, an outer core made of magma, and a solid inner core.**
- The inner core’s outer shell and its newly confirmed innermost sphere both are hot enough to be molten but are a **solid iron-nickel alloy because the incredible pressure at the centre of the Earth renders it a solid state.**
- The inner core is **slowly growing in size at the expense of the outer core** by solidifying molten materials as Earth gradually cools.

 **Context**: According to a new study, **the mantle — a 2,900 km thick layer of solid rock** sandwiched between the **Earth’s upper crust and lower core** — **has been hiding two layers**.

- One is the “**low viscosity” zone** in the upper mantle.
- The other layer is the **low-velocity zone, which is also a part of the upper mantle**.

**Significance of this layer:**

- Affects how Earth **transports heat and mixes materials** between the crust, core, and mantle over time.
- The mantle’s **viscous properties govern convection — the transfer of heat between areas of different temperature**s, enabling plate tectonics.
- The viscosity of the rocks in the transition zone between the upper and the lower mantle determines whether a **plate sinks below another one (subduction) through**

#### **GS Paper 1/2**

 **Syllabus:** **Issues related to women/ Issues Relating to Development and Management of Social Sector/Services relating to Health**

**Source:** [**WHO**](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240068759)

 **Context:** Every day in 2020, approximately 800 women died (a woman every two minutes) globally from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth

**Background:**

- **Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3** (target 3.1) is **to reduce maternal mortality to less than 70 deaths per 100 000 live births by 2030.**
- The report has been published by the United Nations Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-Agency Group (**MMEIG**) – comprising WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, the WB Group and the UNDESA/Population Division has collaborated on a new round of estimates (2000 to 2020).
- The report presents **global, regional and country-level estimates** and trends for maternal mortality (between 2000-2020).

**India**

- As per the Sample Registration System (SRS) report by the Registrar General of India (RGI), the **Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) of India** has **reduced** from 130 per 100,000 live births in 2014-16 to **113 per 100,000 live births** in 2016-18.

**Findings:**

- The global MMR in 2020 was estimated at **223** maternal deaths per 100 000 live births, down from 227 in 2015 and 339 in 2000 – a reduction of one-third (34.3%) over the full 20-year period.
- Three countries had more than 10 000 maternal deaths in 2020:
    - **India** (24 000)
    - DR Congo (22 000)
    - Ethiopia (10 000)

### [Menstrual leave and its global standing](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/28/menstrual-leave-and-its-global-standing/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus****:** **Issues related to women**

**Source:** [The Hindu](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/explained-menstrual-leave-and-its-global-standing/article66554246.ece#:~:text=The%20Bill%20titled%20'The%20Right,extend%20the%20benefit%20for%20students.)

**Context**: The Supreme Court **refused to entertain a PIL about menstrual leave for workers** and students across the country, calling it a policy matter.

**About Menstrual leave/period leave:**

- Menstrual leave refers to **all policies that allow employees or students to take time off** **when they are experiencing menstrual pain or discomfort**. In the context of the workplace, it refers to policies that allow for both **paid or unpaid leave, or time for rest.**

**Examples from India:**

- **Zomato in 2020,** announced a **10-day paid period of leave per year**, and **Swiggy and Byjus have also followed suit.**
- Among State governments, **Bihar and Kerala are the only ones to introduce menstrual leave to women.**
- The Bihar government, then headed by **Lalu Prasad Yadav, introduced its menstrual leave policy in 1992**, allowing employees **two days of paid menstrual leave every month.**
- [Kerala](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/24/kerala-announces-menstrual-leave-time-to-talk-period/) **announced that the State’s Higher** **Education department grants menstrual and maternity leaves for students in universities that function under the department**.

**Global Examples:**

- **Spain became the first European country** to grant paid menstrual leave to workers, among a host of other **sexual health rights**.
- Japan introduced **menstrual leave as part of labour law in 1947** after the idea became popular with labour unions in the 1920s. At present, under **Article 68, employers cannot ask women who experience difficult periods to work during that time.**
- **Indonesia introduced a policy in 1948, amended in 2003**, saying that workers experiencing menstrual pain are not obliged to work on the first two days of their cycle.
- In the **Philippines**, workers are permitted two days of menstrual leave a month.
- **Taiwan** has an Act of **Gender Equality in Employment in place.** Under Article 14 of the Act, employees have the **right to request a day off as period leave every month, at half their regular wage.**
- South Korea takes a slightly different route, allowing for **monthly physiologic leave under Article 73 of their labour law, allowing all female workers to get a day off every month**.
- Among the African nations, **Zambia introduced one day of leave a month without needing a reason or a medical certificate, calling it Mother’s Day.**
- Companies across nations, such as **Nike and Coexist, have introduced menstrual leave as an internal policy.**

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Government Policies and Interventions for Development in various sectors and Issues arising out of their Design and Implementation**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/forests/ifr-review-states-do-dubious-paperwork-cite-baseless-reasons-for-refusing-forest-rights-to-tribals-dte-finds-87939)

 **Context: Individual Forest Rights (IFR),** without which forest dwellers stand to be evicted from their native habitations, have been awarded to very few applicants across the country.

**Background:**

- [The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act 2006 (FRA](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/09/16/the-scheduled-tribes-and-other-traditional-forest-dwellers-recognition-of-rights-act/)**)**, recognizes the rights of the forest-dwelling communities to forest resources.
- The Act encompasses –
    - **Individual rights:** Rights of Self-cultivation and Habitation
    - **Community Rights**: Grazing, Fishing and access to Water bodies in forests, access to biodiversity, etc.
- It also provides **rights to the allocation of forest land for developmental purposes** to fulfil the basic infrastructural needs of the community.
- In conjunction with the [Land Acquisition Rehabilitation and Settlement Act 2013](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/09/29/right-to-fair-compensation-and-transparency-in-land-acquisition-rehabilitation-and-resettlement-act-2013/), **FRA protects the tribal population from eviction** without rehabilitation and settlement.
- **The Gram Sabha** is a highly empowered body under the Act, enabling the tribal population to have a decisive say in the determination of local policies and schemes impacting them.

**The procedure for granting the IFR:**

- Gram Sabha → sub-divisional-level committee (SDLC) → district-level committee (DLC)
- **The Forest Rights Committee** (FRC) is elected from Gram Sabhas in order to assist a Gram Sabha in the process of vesting the rights/reviewing the decision of the above committees.
- As per the FRA, **IFR claims cannot be rejected because of a lack of documents.**

**Challenges:**

- [High rate of IFR claim rejection](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/12/29/insights-into-editorial-looking-beyond-the-forest-rights-act/#:~:text=The%20Scheduled%20Tribes%20and%20Other,right%20to%20life%20and%20livelihood.)**.** According to the MoTA, **almost half** the IFR applications that were previously rejected and sent for review were rejected once again.
- In 2019, the SC directed the states to evict (1,191,273 tribals across 20 states) those FRA claimants whose IFR claims were rejected.

**The SC (in 2019), while staying its eviction order asked states:**

- To supply information on the number of rejections,
- Procedure followed,
- Reasons for rejection and
- If the tribals had been given the chance to produce evidence before the rejection of claims.

**Best practice (MP Govt.’s Van Mitra Portal):** To simplify the process, an online portal called **MP Van Mitra** would allow the claimants whose claims had been rejected to re-apply for review.

### [Unpacking the new set of e-waste rules](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/28/unpacking-the-new-set-of-e-waste-rules/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus:** **Conservation, Environmental Pollution and Degradation**

 **Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/unpacking-the-new-set-of-e-waste-rules/article66560850.ece)

 **Context:** In a time of increased urbanisation, digitalisation and population growth, the problem of [managing e-waste](https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/environment-pollution-and-control/waste-management/e-waste/) is an ongoing challenge.

**Background:**

- The first set of **e-waste Rules** (2011) introduced **Extended Producer Responsibility** (EPR) – which made ‘producers’ responsible for the safe disposal of e-waste once the consumer discards them.
- **E-waste rules 2016** (amended in 2018) included provisions to promote **‘authorisation’** and **‘product stewardship’**, stakeholders such as the ‘**Producer Responsibility Organisations**’ (PRO) were also introduced in these rules.
    - PROs acted as an **intermediary** between producers (bidding for contracts) and formal recyclers (arranging for ‘certified and authorised’ recycling).
- The MoEFCC notified a new set of e-waste rules – [E-Waste (Management) Rules 2022.](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/11/11/government-notified-e-waste-management-rules-2022/)

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/disposing.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/disposing.png)

**Key provisions of the E-Waste (Management) Rules 2022:**

- Unlike the earlier rules (seeking authorisation by stakeholders), the new rules provide for the **‘Registration of Stakeholders’** (manufacturer/producer/refurbisher/recycler).
- A ‘**digitalised systems approach**’ may now standardise the e-waste value chain through a common digital ‘portal’.
- The above provisions **will reduce the frequency of ‘false trail’** – falsely revealing 100% collection on paper while collecting/weighing ‘scrap’ to meet targets.

[Issues with the 2022 rules](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/08/01/new-e-waste-rules-threaten-jobs/)**:**

- **Weak monitoring system** and a **lack of transparency**. **For example,** many recyclers undertake activities only up to the pre-processing/segregation stage and channelise e-waste to the informal sector, which is a pure violation of the law.
- Two important stages of efficient e-waste recycling – **component recovery and residual disposal** – are briefly touched upon.
- **It does away with PRO and dismantlers** and vests all the responsibility of recycling with authorised recyclers.
- **The informal sector**, which plays a crucial role (95% of e-waste is channelised) in e-waste handling, draws no recognition in the new rules.

**Way ahead:**

- Ensuring the requirement of the **recovery tangent.**
- The activities of the recyclers must be recorded → tracing the quantity of [e-waste](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/10/19/international-e-waste-day/) that went for recycling.
- **A robust collection and** [recycling](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/05/25/60-e-waste-recycling-likely-by-2023/) **system** on the ground.
- Stakeholders **must have the right information and intent** to safely dispose of e-waste.
- There is a need for **increased consumer awareness**, strengthening reverse logistics, building capacity, improving existing infrastructure, adopting green procurement practices, etc.

**Best practice:**

- **‘Karo Sambhav’**, a Delhi-based PRO, has integrated informal aggregators in its collection mechanism → e-waste entered a safe and structured system → informal sector has an advantage in terms of financial and legal security.
- **IIT Hyderabad** launched M.Tech courses in e-Waste Resources.

### **Bendable Concrete**

 **Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/bendable-concrete-co2-infused-cement-mixes-could-dramatically-cut-global-emissions/article66555825.ece)

 Engineers are developing **CO2-infused concrete** that **sequesters greenhouse gases** and is stronger, and even **bendable**.

- In the USA, states like New York and New Jersey are promoting policies for use of such concretes.

 **Issues with Concrete:**

- Cement production accounts for **7% of global carbon dioxide emissions.**
- Concrete is one of the **most-used resources on Earth, with an estimated 26 billion tons** produced annually worldwide. It has a high carbon footprint.

 **What is Bendable Concrete?**

Unlike conventional concrete, bendable concrete can **bend under pressure without rupturing**.

- Bendable concrete makes infrastructure safer, extends its service life and reduces maintenance costs and resource use.

**Usage**: This innovative example can be used in Environment/Disaster management paper as a way to sequester carbon as well as make buildings safer from the earthquake.

**Context:** Agricultural scientists are recommending **additional irrigation for Rabi crops** due to unprecedented heat in February this year.

**Impact of** [**heat waves**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/08/heatwaves-in-india/) **on wheat production:**

- **When the temperature rises above the normal range for wheat**, it can reduce photosynthesis, which is essential for plant growth and grain development.
    - **Excessive heat** can lead to crop damage.
- **Decrease in groundwater levels**: To minimize the impact of heat waves, farmers have to irrigate the field several times. This may reduce the groundwater level in the area.
    - **Strong winds can destroy wheat crops** if the soil is wet.
- **Increased pest attacks:** Pests like aphids and thrips thrive in warm and dry weather

 **Context:** A semiconductor alliance comprising the **world’s top producers of semiconductors**— the US, Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea has been convened recently.

**Objective:**

- Serve as an early warning and mutual reminder system to ensure a **stable supply chain for chip manufacturers**
- Prevent the occurrence of chip shortages and supply chain disruptions
- To reduce the **world’s dependence** on China.

[India has limited fabs](https://www.orfonline.org/research/india-in-the-era-of-silicon-diplomacy/?amp), or semiconductor fabrication plants, which manufacture chips and mostly is dependent on imports.

### **AFTER**

 **Context**: AIIMS Delhi has created AIIMS Facial Toolbox for Emotions Recognition (AFTER)

**Usages:**

- It will make it easier to treat patients with autism, schizophrenia and depression
- **Emotion Recognition Capability** can be detected in people with neuropsychiatric conditions
- **Research in the Indian context: The** interpretation of emotion is **culturally dependent**, so this culturally sensitive database shows promise for use in research settings and needs to be validated in the general population.

### **‘Organ on a chip’**

 **Source**: [TH](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/organ-on-a-chip-the-new-lab-setup-scientists-are-using-instead-of-animals-to-test-new-drugs/article66556008.ece)

 **Context**: The recent **U.S. Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act 2.0** has approved computer-based and experimental alternatives to animals to test new drugs.

- Although using animals, as drug testbeds, will continue

**What are Organ-on-a-Chips?**

They are **small devices containing human cells** that are used to **mimic the environment in human organs,** including blood flow and breathing movements, serving as synthetic environments in which to test new drugs.

**Benefits:**

- **Boost the research and development** of Organ chips
- **Reduce the cost** of R&D of drugs
- **Animal models often poorly mimic human diseases**, which has led scientists to develop alternative models
- **Reduce the chances of contamination** and spread of disease from animals being experimented on.
- **Organ chips** can be used to **develop personalised therapies** for individual patients
- **Minimize ethical dilemmas associated** with the use of animals for testing (treatment of animal and their well-being)

**In India**: Researchers in India are also developing **organ-on-a-chip models**, including a **skin-on-chip model**, which is being tested for studying skin irritation and toxicity, and a **retina-on-chip model**.

### **Mad Cow Disease**

 **Source**: [HT](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mad-cow-disease-details-mad-cow-disease-case-halts-brazil-s-beef-exports-to-china-what-is-it-101677111465819.html)

**Context**: Brazil has halted its beef exports to China after a case of mad cow disease was confirmed in its northern state.

- Brazil is **the largest exporter of Beef in** the world while the USA is the largest producer.

**About the Disease:** 

**Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) (or simply Mad Cow Disease)** is a degenerative, transmissible, slowly progressive, and fatal infection that affects the central nervous system of adult cattle.

**How is it caused?**

It is caused by a **protein called a ‘prion’** normally found on the cell surfaces of cattle. However, the normal prion protein changes into an abnormal prion protein and these proteins destroy the nervous system tissue- the brain and spinal cord.

### **What is the ALMA telescope, that will soon get a ‘new brain’?**

 **Source:** [Indian Express](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/what-is-alma-telescope-8467423/#:~:text=The%20Atacama%20Large%20Millimetre%2Fsubmillimetre,the%20journal%20Science%20reported%20recently.)

 **Context**: The [Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2018/12/14/atacama-large-millimeter-array-alma/) — a radio telescope comprising **66 antennas**— is set to get software and hardware upgrades that will help it collect much more data and produce sharper images than ever before.

ALMA is operated under a partnership among the **United States, 16 countries in Europe, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Chile**

[What is ALMA](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2018/12/14/atacama-large-millimeter-array-alma/)**?**

ALMA is a **state-of-the-art telescope that studies celestial objects at millimetre and submillimetre** wavelengths — they can **penetrate through dust clouds and help astronomers** examine dim and distant galaxies and stars out there. It also **has extraordinary sensitivity, which allows it to detect even extremely faint radio signals.**

**[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/alma.jpg?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/alma.jpg)**

**Why Chile:**

- The millimetre and submillimetre waves observed by it are very **susceptible to atmospheric water vapour absorption on Earth**.
- The desert is the **driest place in the world, meaning most of the nights here are clear of** clouds and free of light-distorting moisture — making it a perfect location for examining the universe.

 **What are some of the notable discoveries made by ALMA?**

- One of the earliest findings came in 2013 when it discovered **starburst galaxies earlier in the universe’s history than they were previously thought to have existed.**
- ALMA provided **detailed images of the protoplanetary disc surrounding HL Tauri — a very young T Tauri** star in the constellation **Taurus**, approximately 450 light years from Earth
- In 2015, the telescope helped scientists observe a phenomenon known as **the** [Einstein ring](https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/2005/32/1788-Image.html)**, which occurs when light from a galaxy or star passes by a massive object en route to the Earth**, in extraordinary detail.
