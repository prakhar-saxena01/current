### [Is judicial majoritarianism justified?](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/02/is-judicial-majoritarianism-justified/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus****: Judicial Reforms**

**Source:** [The Hindu](https://www.thehindu.com/specials/text-and-context/is-judicial-majoritarianism-justified/article66460574.ece)

**Context: The blind acceptance of numerical majorities in judicial decision-making** and the constitutional disregard of analysis and appreciation of arguments and evidence in dissenting judgments have been in news recently **after the recent Supreme Court Judgement on demonetization.**

**What is judicial majoritarianism?**

- The requirement for a majority consensus **flows from Article 145(5)** of the Constitution, which states that **no judgment in such cases can be delivered** **except with the concurrence of a majority of the judge**s but that judges are free to deliver dissenting judgments or opinions.
- Numerical majorities are of particular importance to cases, which involve a **substantial interpretation of constitutional provisions**. In such cases, **Constitutional Benches, consisting of five or more judges, are set up in consonance with Article 145(3) of the Constitution.**
- Such Benches usually consist of **five, seven, nine, 11 or even 13 judges.**

**An issue with Judicial Majoritarianism:**

- Issue of why numerical **majorities of judicial bodies are accepted** without any debate**, while numerical majorities in representative bodies such as the Lok Sabha are often looked at with suspicion**.

**Reflect upon the concept of judicial majoritarianism:**

- **Jeremy Waldron** in his **‘Five to Four: Why Do Bare Majorities Rule on Courts?’** He holds that the arguments of – **efficiency through ease of decision-making; epistemic objectivity through majority adherence; and equality through fairness,** which are made in **defence of judicial majoritarianism cannot explain or justify our adherence to majority decisions.**
- As opposed to **representatives of the people in legislatures who may act on hunches or popular perception, judges are experts of law and are aware of the arguments for and against the impugned matter.** Given the same, Jeremy Waldron questions why is it that the **judges too have to resort to head counting in order to resolve disagreements amongst judges.**
- All judges on a particular Bench **give their rulings on the same set of facts, laws, arguments and written submissions.** In light of the same, any differences **in judicial decisions can be attributed to a difference in either the methodology adopted and the logic applied by the judges in their interpretation,** or, upon their own ‘**judicial hunches’ which may be an outcome of their subjective experiences, outlook, perceptions, prejudices and biases.**

**Constitutional history:**

- The dissenting opinion of **Justice H.R. Khanna in A.D.M. Jabalpur v. Shivkant Shukla (1976) upholding the right to life and personal liberty even during situations of constitutional exceptionalism is a prime example**.
- Another example is the dissenting opinion of **Justice Subba Rao in the Kharak Singh v. State of U.P. (1962) case upholding the right to privacy which received the judicial stamp of approval in the K.S. Puttaswamy v. UOI (2017) case**.

**Solution/Way Forward:**

- **Seniority-based assessment**: Ronald Dworkin proffers a system which **may either give more weightage to the vote of senior judges** given that they have more experience or to the junior judges as they may **represent popular opinion better.**
- **Inculcate critical discourse**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/specials/text-and-context/alienation-the-separation-of-labour-from-the-product-process-humanity-and-society/article66456011.ece#:~:text=KEYWORD-,Alienation%3A%20the%20separation%20of%20labour%20from,product%2C%20process%2C%20humanity%20and%20society)

 **In sociology,** alienation means the **state of feeling estranged or separated from one’s milieu**, work, products of work, or self.

**In Economy (by Karl Marx):** It is the process whereby the worker is made to feel foreign to the products of his/her own labour.

- **Marx discussed four forms of alienation:** From the Product; From the Process; From Humanity; From society.

**Karl Marx was a German philosopher,** economist, historian, sociologist, political theorist, journalist, a critic of political economy, and socialist revolutionary. His **best-known titles** are the 1848 pamphlet **The Communist Manifesto** and the four-volume **Das Kapital.**

### **Indian start-ups are looking at Reverse Flipping**

**Source:** [TOI](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/indian-startups-are-looking-at-reverse-flipping/articleshow/97499074.cms)

 **Context**: Indian **start-ups are exploring ‘reverse flipping’, or shifting their domicile back to India**, with easy access to capital from private equity and venture capital, changes in rules **regarding round-tripping, and the growing maturity of India’s capital markets, observed the Economic Survey 2022-23.**

**About Flipping and Reverse Flipping:**

- Flipping refers to the **process of transferring the entire ownership of an Indian company to an overseas entity, accompanied by a transfer of intellectual property (IP)** and all data hitherto owned by the Indian company.
- This **effectively transforms an Indian company into a 100 per cent subsidiary of a foreign entity,** with the founders and investors retaining the same ownership via the foreign entity, having swapped all shares.
- Reverse flipping **is shifting their domicile back to India.**

**Why start-ups were flipping before:**

- **Challenges faced by start-ups**: **funding hurdles, revenue generation struggles, lack of easy access to supportive infrastructure, and a complex regulatory tax environment**. S**tart-ups have been headquartered overseas**, especially in destinations with **favourable legal environments and taxation policies**.

### **Two-foot-tall infant weighing almost 8kg, born in Brazil: Get to know macrosomia, the condition that creates gigantic babies**

 **Source:** [Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/two-foot-tall-infant-weighing-almost-8kg-born-in-brazil-get-to-know-macrosomia-the-condition-that-creates-gigantic-babies/articleshow/97543168.cms)

**Context**: A mother in Brazil recently gave **birth to a two-foot-tall baby weighing 16lb (7.3kg**). 

**About Macrosomia:**

The term used to **describe these giant babies is macrosomia** (Greek for the large body). Any baby that **weighs more than 4kg, regardless of its gestational age, is said to have macrosomia**.

**Factors that cause Macrosomia:**

- **Body weight of the mother**. Obese mothers tend to have kinds with Macrosomia.
- In mothers with **gestational diabetes** (high blood sugar that arises during pregnancy), this increases to between 15 per cent and 45 per cent of births.
- **Being older when pregnant** also increases the odds of having a baby with macrosomia.
- **Previous pregnancies increase the risk of macrosomi**a because, with each successive pregnancy, birth weight increases.
- **Overdue pregnancies** – those that run past the typical 40 weeks – also increase the risk of a baby being macrosomic, **particularly at 42 weeks or more**.
- **Having a boy increases the likelihood of macrosomia**. Boys are three times more likely than girls to be born macrosomic.

**Issues:**

- Babies with macrosomia are more **likely to encounter difficulties moving through the birth canal because of their large size.**
- **“Shoulder dystocia”** – which may cause **permanent harm to shoulders**. While the baby is stuck, it **cannot breathe and the umbilical cord may be squeezed.**
- Mothers are also at **increased risk of vaginal tears during delivery**, which then increases the risk of postpartum **haemorrhage (bleeding)**

### **Radioactive capsule lost – and found – in Australia: Here’s what happened**

**Source:** [Indian Express](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/radioactive-capsule-lost-and-found-australia-8418556/#:~:text=When%20it%20was%20unpacked%20on,capsule%20fell%20out%2C%20reported%20Reuters.)

 **Context**: The **Caesium-137 capsule lost in transit** more than two weeks ago was discovered using **specialist detection equipment, which picked up the radiation**.

**What are the risks that the capsule posed?**

- Radioactive materials like **Caesium-137 produce beta and gamma radiation**, both of which are harmful to humans. When exposed to them, **short-term risks include that radiation poisoning (which can be deadly) whereas in the long term,** it can also be a cause of cancer and damage human DNA.
- **The 20-metre exclusion zone** has been set up **around the capsule while defence force members verify it via a serial number**.
- Experts say that the capsule, **which emits radiation equal to roughly 10 X-rays per hour, was unlikely to contaminate the area it fell in.**
