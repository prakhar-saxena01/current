#### **GS Paper 1**

**Syllabus****: Ancient India: Vijayanagara Kingdom**

**Source:** [**Indian Express**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/victory-city-vijayanagara-8432471/)

 **Context**: Salman Rushdie released a new novel **“Victory City”** – a fictionalized story of the Vijayanagara Kingdom.

**About** [**Vijaynagara**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/medieval-indian-history/vijayanagara/) **Kingdom: 1336 AD – 1646 AD**

- Founded by **Harihara I of the Sangama dynasty,** Vijayanagara expanded from a strategic position on the banks of the **Tungabhadra river with Hampi as its capital.**
- The kingdom reached its **peak under** [**Krishna Deva Raya**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/02/26/sri-krishnadevaraya/) **(reign 1509-1529),** a period in which it enjoyed military superiority to its rival kingdoms such as the [**Bahmani Sultanate**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/medieval-indian-history/bahamani-kingdom/)**, the Golconda Sultanate, and the Gajapatis of Odisha.** 

**Economy:**

- **Largely dependent on agriculture**, trade thrived in its many ports on either coast.
- Traveller **Abd al-Razzaq Samarqandi** chronicled how “**the ports of Mangalore, Honavar, Bhatkal, Barkur, Cochin, Cannanore, Machilipatnam, and Dharmadam saw traders from Africa, Arabia, Aden, the Red sea, China and Bengal and also served as shipbuilding centres**”.
- The empire’s principal **exports were pepper, ginger, cinnamon, cardamom, myrobalan, tamarind, timber, anafistula, precious and semi-precious stones, pearls, musk, ambergris, rhubarb, aloe, cotton cloth, and porcelain.**
- Coins were minted by the state as well as by merchant guilds using **gold, silver, copper, and brass, and their value depended on material weight.**

**Architecture and Literature:**

- Literature in **Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, as well as Sanskrit**, was produced in the kingdom, with new writing styles and methods emerging.
- Vijayanagara architecture is “**a vibrant combination and blossoming of the** [**Chalukya,**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/10/14/chalukya-dynasty/) [**Hoysala**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/medieval-indian-history/southern-dynasties/hoysalas/)**, Pandya and** [**Chola styles**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/10/13/the-grandeur-of-the-chola-empire/)**,”**
- The **Prasanna Virupaksha temple of Bukka I and the Hazara Rama temple of Krishna Deva Raya** are striking examples of Vijayanagara’s characteristic style and intricate artistry.

**Vijayanagara’s capital** [**Hampi**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/02/12/hampi/) **is a UNESCO World Heritage Site** known for its sophisticated fortifications as well as innumerable temples and other architectural marvels. From accounts of foreign travellers, by the beginning of the 16th century, **Hampi-Vijayanagara was probably the second-largest urban settlement on the planet (after Beijing)**.

**Context:** The [Monetary Policy Committee](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/06/09/what-is-the-rbis-mpc-2/#:~:text=What%20is%20Repo%20Rate%3F,to%20keep%20inflation%20under%20control.) (MPC) hiked the **Repo rate** (or the rate at which the RBI lends funds to banks), by 25 basis points to **6.50 per cent** in a bid to **rein in retail inflation**.

- RBI has projected GDP growth for the **next fiscal (FY2024) at 6.4%**

**Impact of raising the Repo rate:**

- **Lending rates of banks are expected to go up**, leading to a rise in EMIs on vehicles, homes, and personal loans.
    - **Over 43% of the total loans** are linked to the Repo rate and are expected to rise now
- **Lower Inflation**: The hike in the Repo rate is expected to help moderate [inflation](https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-economy-3/inflation/#:~:text=Inflation%20targeting%20is%20a%20monetary,inflation%20target%20to%20the%20public.) in the country as the cost of borrowing will increase and the demand of people will thus decrease.

**Reason for RBI’s hawkish stance:** It could be due to its outlook on India’s slower economic growth and higher inflation in 2023-24.

This is box title

- Monetary policy deals with the **supply and cost of money** in an economy.
- **The primary objective of the RBI’s monetary policy** is to maintain **price stability** while keeping in mind the **objective of growth**.
- **The amended** [**RBI**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-economy-3/the-reserve-bank-of-india-and-monetary-management/definition-of-monetary-policy/) **Act, 1934**provides for the **inflation target (4% +-2%)** to be set by the Government of India, in consultation with the Reserve Bank, **once every five years**.
- **The latest monetary policy review** was significant because it was made to bring inflation back to the **target level of 4%.**

This is box title

**As per the Amended (in 2016) RBI Act, 1934**: The central government is empowered to constitute a **six-member Monetary Policy Committee** (MPC) to determine the Policy Rate required to achieve the inflation target”.

- Its decisions are **binding** on the Bank.
- **Eligibility criteria to be a member:** Must be from “persons of ability, integrity and standing, having knowledge and experience in the field of economics or banking or finance or monetary policy”

**GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus****: Agriculture: Farm Mechanization**

**Source:** [**PIB**](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1897076#:~:text=The%20MoS%20said%20that%20the,more%20affordable%20to%20end%20users.)

**Context: NCAER** (National Council of Applied Economic Research) has released a report **on “Making India a Global Power House on Farm Machinery Industry”.**

- The report analyzed the **non-tractor farm machinery industry from both demand and supply side perspectives** and **provides recommendations for reforms based on global practices.**

**Farm Mechanization:**

- It refers to the **use of machinery and equipment in** [**agricultural**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-economy-3/agriculture/indian-agriculture-in-the-present-times/) **operations**. It involves the **integration of various tools and** [**technologies**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/09/24/indian-agri-tech/) to automate and streamline various farming processes, including **planting, tilling, harvesting, and transporting crops.**

**Key highlights of the report:**

- Recommends measures and reforms for India to **become a production and export hub for non-tractor farm machinery in the next 15 years.**
- The farm power availability in India is **much lower compared to other countries like Korea, Japan, and the USA.**

**Issues with Farm Mechanization:**

- **Power supply:** Availability of adequate **farm power is very crucial** for timely farm operations for increasing production and productivity and reducing losses.
- **Uneven distribution**
- **A mismatch between the needs** of Indian farmers and what the farm machinery sector is producing.
- **Banks are reluctant** to lend to farmers.

**Steps taken by the Government to promote** [**Farm Mechanization**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/02/14/discuss-the-prospects-of-transforming-indian-agriculture-through-farm-mechanization-highlight-the-steps-taken-so-far-by-the-government-of-india-in-recent-times-in-this-direction/):

- **Sub-Mission on Agricultural Mechanization(SMAM), Drones promotion, etc.**
- **Training and testing by FMTTIs of agricultural machines including tractors, power tillers, combine harvesters,**
- The institutes **have provided a pool of over 2.3 lakh skilled professionals in the area of farm mechanization**

### [A devastating quake in Turkey recalls the tragedies awaiting India](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/09/a-devastating-quake-in-turkey-recalls-the-tragedies-awaiting-india/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus:** **Disaster Management and Preparedness**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/analysis-a-devastating-quake-in-turkey-recalls-the-tragedies-awaiting-india/article66484858.ece)

**Direction:** The article highlights how India should use the recent [earthquake in Turkey](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/08/turkey-earthquake/) as a lesson and get ready for the future.

**Why is Indian terrain prone to great earthquakes?**

- The political boundaries roughly follow the **tectonic divides** in the west, the north and the east.
- The 2,500-km-long **Himalayan** plate boundary from the northwest to the northeast.
- The historical release of geological tension doesn’t fully account for the strain that has built up.
    - **For instance**, the Central Himalayas has been historically deficient in earthquakes.
- **New dams** at the foothills of the Himalayas.

**The trend in annual losses from disasters:** Has been **markedly upward,** mainly due to an **increase in the aerial extent of habitation** in vulnerable areas.

**Way ahead:**

- Undertake **a comprehensive study of the vulnerability** of buildings and structures.
- **To ensur**e –
    - All **new** **constructions** (especially in high-risk zones) can resist shaking and
    - All **existing buildings** are protected by retrofitting.
- In areas where traditional structures are more common, bolster traditional [earthquake resistance](https://www.insightsonindia.com/world-geography/physical-geography-of-the-world/geomorphology/internal-forces-their-impact/earthquakes/earthquake-hazard-mitigation/)
- **Must overhaul town and municipal planning** by-laws to accommodate hazard-safety measures.
- Use the **appropriate building codes**, developed by the Bureau of Indian Standards.
- **Develop an environmental land zonation scheme** for urban and rural areas.
- Translate detailed scientific knowledge on earthquake safety into a format that is easily **available, accessible, and actionable**
- **Real-time and free data-sharing** should become a norm.

**Conclusion:**

[The Turkey](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/07/why-turkey-is-prone-to-devastating-earthquakes/) and the [Joshimath](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/09/geology-to-unplanned-construction-decoding-why-joshimath-is-sinking/) disaster must be an eye-opener for Indian authorities to **integrate development with** [**disaster mitigation**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/disaster-management/) **strategies,** through systematic, long-term, cost-effective and grassroots community-based initiatives.

### **ASI’s Keeladi report pushes Sangam age further back to 800 BCE**

 **Source:** [**The Hindu**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/asis-keeladi-report-pushes-sangam-age-further-back-to-800-bce/article66486407.ece#:~:text=Keeladi%20continues%20to%20redefine%20Tamil,about%2013%20km%20from%20Madurai.)

 **Context**: [The Sangam age](https://www.insightsonindia.com/ancient-indian-history/sangam-age/#:~:text=The%20Sangam%20period%20or%20age,3rd%20century%20CE.) has been **pushed to 800 BCE based** on the archaeological findings from an excavation carried out by the [Archaeological Survey of India.](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Archaeological-Survey-of-India-ASI.pdf)

- Based on the results of stratigraphy of the cultural deposits, the period of the **Sangam era archaeological site has been placed between the 8th century BCE to the 3rd century CE(800 BCE and 300 CE)**
- Sangam age **was believed to be between 300 BCE to 300 CE**.
- It has been classified into three periods:
    - The **pre-early historic period between 800 BCE to 500 BCE**
    - **The mature early history between 500 BCE to the end of 1st century BCE**
    - **Post-early history from 1st century BCE to 300 CE**

### **Dhamaal**

 **Context**: A new documentary — has focused on the **music and dance performances of the Siddi** community in Gujarat, **called Dhamaals.**

 **What are Dhamaals?**

- Dhamaal is a **mix of Sufi and African (mostly East African)** musical and dance traditions. It refers particularly to the **spiritual practices of the Siddis of Gujarat.**
- The Siddis begin almost every Dhamaal song by **blowing into a conch shell**.
- **Instrument**: East African percussion instruments like the musindo and the slow **thumping of feet**
- Dhamaals are performed in **memory of their spiritual leaders** – **Bava Gor, Mai Misra, Baba Habash and Sidi Nabi Sultan.**
- They are performed in two ways — **Dance Dhamaal (sitting and dance position) and Baithaaki Dhamaal** (only sitting position)

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/dhamal.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/dhamal.png)**

### **How are state police chiefs appointed?**

 **Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/row-over-nagaland-dgp-how-are-state-police-chiefs-appointed-8430320/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20SC's%20guidelines,range%20of%20experience%20for%20heading)

 **Context: The Nagaland government** has appointed Rupin Sharma as Director General of the state police after SC’s direction.

- Previously, Nagaland had challenged the Union Public Service Commission’s (UPSC) recommendation of Sharma as the only candidate for the post.

**The appointment process:** 

**The appointment of DGP (based on the** [**SC 2006 judgment (Prakash Singh case**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/04/02/the-2006-supreme-court-ruling-on-police-reforms/)**):**

- DGP is selected from the **three senior-most officers** who have been empanelled for promotion by the UPSC “on the basis of their length of service, very good record, and range of experience for heading the police force”.
- **The empanelment committee** selects the panel of three officers based on merit.
- UPSC shall not put in the panel **any officer with less than 6 months to retirement**
- DGP should have a fixed tenure of two years in the post, irrespective of retirement date

**UPSC guidelines on the appointment process:**

- The list of **eligible officers** must have **at least 30 years of service** and be submitted to the UPSC **six months before the incumbent DGP** is to retire.
- **The 30-year rule** may be relaxed to 25 years in certain states with the consent of the Centre

**The Issue:**

- The process of appointment has **faced challenges with at least four states** having interim police chiefs and some cases of the Centre not following the Prakash Singh judgment.

### **The status and proceeds of disinvestment**

**Source**: [TH](https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/explained-the-status-and-proceeds-of-disinvestment/article66485958.ece#:~:text=As%20of%20February%208%2C%202023%2C%20the%20government's%20disinvestment%20receipts%20stood,estimate%20of%20%E2%82%B965%2C000%20crores.)

The Indian government’s [disinvestment](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Disinvestment-in-India.pdf) target for **2023-24 is ₹51,000 crore, down 21%** from the previous year and the lowest target in seven years.

**Status of** [**disinvestment**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Disinvestment-in-India.pdf):

- The government has met its **disinvestment targets only six times** in the last three decades. The last time the government met its target was in **2018-19**
- **In 2021-22,** the government missed its high target of **₹1.75 lakh** crore by a significant margin.
- **The planned privatisation** of the Shipping Corporation of India, Container Corporation of India, and NMDC Steel are among the state-owned companies that will be divested in 2023-24.

**Definition**: Disinvestment refers to the sale of government assets or subsidiaries.

**Need for disinvestment**: The government may disinvest to reduce fiscal burden, finance the fiscal deficit, or encourage private ownership of assets.

### **Quasicrystals**

 **Source**: [TH](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/quasicrystals-remember-the-chaos/article66480253.ece)

 **Direction**: The concept is technical and one needn’t go into so many details of Material science. Here we have taken the bare minimum, one needs to know from the UPSC perspective.

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/quas.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/quas.png)

**More about Quasicrystals:**

It is challenging to create quasicrystals in a laboratory, and the way they form has always been a mystery. Scientists have found natural quasicrystals in three different sources:

- **Khatyrka meteorite** (found in 2011 in Russia)
- In the remains of the **first atomic bomb detonated** (the Trinity test, part of the **Manhattan** **Project**)
- In a metallic fragment in the **Sand Hills dunes in northern Nebraska** (USA)

These three sources suggest that quasicrystals are formed under **extreme conditions such as high pressure, high temperature, and heavy electric currents**.

**Usage:** Quasicrystals have been used in surgical instruments, LED lights and nonstick frying pans. They have poor heat conductivity, which makes them good insulators

### **QR code-based Coin Vending Machine (QCVM)**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/business/rbi-announces-pilot-for-qr-code-based-coin-vending-machine/article66484385.ece)

 **Context:** To improve the distribution of coins, the RBI is preparing a pilot project on QCVM in collaboration with a few leading banks

**What is the QCVM?**

- It is a **cashless coin dispenser** that dispenses coins **in exchange for a bank account debit via the** [**Unified Payments Interface (UPI).**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/12/09/unified-payments-interface-upi-2/)
- Unlike traditional cash-based Coin Vending Machines, **the QCVM would not require banknote tendering or validation.**
- This will offer ease and ready access to coins for customers via the UPI facility.

### **Marine protected areas (MPA)**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/environment/marine-protected-areas-are-underfunded-experts-discuss-ways-to-address-the-funding-gap-87555)

 **Context:** The ongoing **fifth International MPA Congress** discusses solutions to address funding gaps that [marine protected areas (MPA](https://www.insightsonindia.com/world-geography/physical-geography-of-the-world/oceanography/coral-reefs/protection-measures-of-coral-reefs/)) are facing.

**Background:**

- Nations agreed to protect **30% of the planet’s lands and oceans by 2030** at the [COP15 to the CBD](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/20/cop15-montreal-3-days-of-ministerial-talks-on-post-2020-gbf-end-with-limited-success/) held in 2022.
- **70% of MPAs** are underfunded.
- Most current MPAs are located in coastal areas, **while only 2% of the high seas are** protected.

**MPAs in India:**

- They are regarded as one of the **most potent conservation tools for the** [**protection of marine habitats**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marine-Ecological-Crisis.pdf) **and their resources.**
    - Climate-smart MPAs can shield biota from [global warming](https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/climate-change-and-associated-issues/).
- There are a total of **31 major MPAs in India** (as of Feb 2022) covering coastal areas that have been notified under [**Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/01/22/environment-ministrys-proposed-changes-to-wildlife-act/)

 **Way ahead:**

- Funding options like [**UNEP**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/02/05/unep50/) **FI (Finance Initiative)** can be accessed.
- **Founded in 1992,** UNEP FI was the first organisation to engage the finance sector on sustainability and incubated the Principles for Responsible Investment.
