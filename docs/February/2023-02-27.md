**Source:** [The Hindu](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/explained-imd-is-already-sensing-heat-waves-what-are-they-and-why-do-they-happen/article66556185.ece#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20IMD%2C%20a,at%20a%20hill%2Dstation).)

**Direction: This article is in continuation of our previous article on** [**heat waves in northern India.**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/23/unusual-february-heat-and-the-normal-abnormal-in-global-weather-heat-dome/)

**Context: T**he **India Meteorological Department (IMD)** warned that the **maximum temperatures** over **northwest, west, and central India would be 3-5° C higher** than the long-term average.

**What is heat wave?**

- According to the IMD, a region has a **heat wave if its ambient temperature deviates by at least 4.5-6.4° C** from the long-term average. There is also a heat wave if the **maximum temperature crosses 45° C (or 37° C at a hill-station).**

**Origin of Heat Wave in India:**

A study published in **Nature Geoscience** offers some clues as to **how different processes contribute** to the **formation of a heat wave.**

- In spring, India typically **has air flowing in from the west-northwest**. The Middle East is warming faster than other regions in latitudes similarly close to the equator, and **serves as a source of the warm air that blows into India.**
- Air flowing in from the **northwest rolls in over the mountains of Afghanistan and Pakistan**, so some of the compression also happens on the leeward side of these mountains, entering India with a bristling warmth.
- The air flowing in over the **oceans is expected to bring cooler** air, but the **Arabian Sea is warming faster than most other ocean regions.**
- The strong upper atmospheric westerly winds that come in from the Atlantic Ocean over to India during spring control the near-surface winds. The energy to run past the earth near the surface, against the surface friction, can only come from above. This **descending air compresses and warms up to generate some heat waves.**
- [Global warming](https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/climate-change-and-associated-issues/what-causes-global-warming/) tends to warm the upper atmosphere faster than the air near the surface. This in turn means that the **sinking air is warmer due to global warming, and thus produces heat waves as it sinks and compresses.**

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Government Policies and Interventions for Development in various sectors and Issues arising out of their Design and Implementation**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lack-of-protection-officers-for-domestic-violence-cases-intrigues-sc-about-mission-shakti/article66557250.ece#:~:text=The%20Supreme%20Court%20has%20sought,deal%20with%20domestic%20violence%20cases.)

**Context:** The SC has sought more information about [**Mission Shakti**](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1841498) because it is concerned about a persistent lack of protection officers to handle [domestic violence](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/11/29/editorial-analysis-still-a-nightmare-for-domestic-violence-survivors/) cases.

**Background:**

- Appointment of protection officers (ideally women) is mandated under Section 8 of **the** [**Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005.**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/11/28/sansad-tv-acts-facts-the-protection-of-women-from-domestic-violence-act-2005/)
- These officers have a pivotal role:
    - **Help victims file complaints**,
    - Give Information to the police,
    - Provide immediate protection and support,
    - Inform victims about their legal rights and
    - Support them through the court proceedings.
- With **4.4 lakh cases pending** in 801 districts, **a protection officer in each of these districts would be saddled with over 500 cases.**
- Even though Mission Shakti provided for the “**one-stop centers**” in most of these districts to receive victims, it is unclear how many of them employ protection officers.
- The government has also been asked about whether Mission Shakti will serve as an umbrella scheme for implementing the Domestic Violence Act.

[**The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act 2005:**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/11/28/sansad-tv-acts-facts-the-protection-of-women-from-domestic-violence-act-2005/)

- The law, which is overseen by the Union Ministry of Women and Child Development (**MWCD**), provides a definition of **“domestic violence”** **for the first time**.
- Domestic violence **includes not only physical violence**, but also **emotional, verbal, sexual and psychological abuse.**
- It is a **civil** law meant primarily for protection orders, rather than criminal enforcement.

[**Mission Shakti:**](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1841498)

- It is an **integrated-umbrella scheme** of MWCD aimed at **strengthening interventions for women safety, security and empowerment** during the 15th Finance Commission period 2021-22 to 2025-26.
- It has two sub-schemes –

### [Towards transparency in OTT regulation](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/27/towards-transparency-in-ott-regulation/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Source:** [The Hindu](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/towards-transparency-in-ott-regulation/article66556360.ece)

**Context: Even after** two years of issuing the [Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/05/26/the-information-technology-guidelines-for-intermediaries-and-digital-media-ethics-code-rules-2021/) there has not been much improvement in the regulation of OTT platforms.

- India’s approach can be termed as a **light-touch ‘co-regulation’** model where there is ‘**self-regulation’ at the industry level and final ‘oversight mechanism’ at the Ministry level.** 

**Issues plaguing OTT regulation:**

- **Lack of awareness:** The Rules mandate the display of contact details relating to grievance redressal mechanisms and grievance officers on OTT websites/interface. **However, compliance is very low.** 
- While the Rules require disclosure of grievance details by publishers and self-regulating bodies, the reporting formats **only capture the number of complaints received and decided**
- **Ambiguity around content regulation**
- **Jurisdictional issues**: Many OTT platforms are based outside India, which makes it difficult to enforce regulations and hold them accountable.
- **Freedom of expression concerns.**

**Solutions:**

- The OTT industry associations could be mandated to run periodic **campaigns in print and electronic media about the grievance redressal mechanism**
- The interpretation of age rating (UA 13+, for example) and the content descriptors ( ‘violence’, for instance) could be in the **respective languages of the video (apart from English).**
- An **independent body** may undertake a periodic audit.
- The Ministry could consider facilitating a dedicated **umbrella website wherein the details of applicable** **Rules, content codes, advisories, contact details** for complaints/appeals, etc. **are published.**

**Examples from other countries:**

**Singapore**

- The **Infocomm Media Development Authority** is the common regulator for different media. Apart from instituting a statutory framework and promoting industry self-regulation, its **approach to media regulation emphasizes on promoting media literacy through public education.**

**Syllabus:** **Indian Economy and related issues**

 **Source:** [**PIB**](https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1902237)

**Context: Digital technology** is playing an important role in achieving **India’s G20 Presidency goal (“Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” or “One Earth, One Family, One Future”).**

**Background:**

- The Indian Presidency’s priority is to make the **digital financial system more efficient, secure, and stable**.
- For this to happen, f**inancial sector regulatory** reforms are essential.
- However, there is **no comprehensive global policy framework for** [**crypto assets**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/science-technology/communication-and-it-technology/cryptocurrency/)**,** despite the rapid evolution of the crypto universe.
- The global standard-setting bodies (such as the [FATF](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/02/22/fatf/), Financial Stability Board (FSB), Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), etc) have been **coordinating the regulatory agenda.**

**Probable benefits of crypto assets:**

- Cheaper and faster cross-border payments
- More integrated financial markets
- Increased [financial inclusion](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/07/16/financial-inclusion/)

**Challenges:**

- **Greater interconnectedness** between crypto assets and the traditional financial sector
- **Complexity and volatility** around crypto assets
- Critical digital infrastructure/platforms
- Global information gaps pertaining to the crypto asset

**Status of** [**Crypto regulation**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/08/03/235523/) **in India:**

- RBI has announced [**Central Bank Digital Currency**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/11/19/sansad-tv-perspective-rbis-digital-currency/#:~:text=A%20Central%20Bank%20Digital%20Currency,and%20credit%20of%20the%20government.) (CBDC), a sort of official cryptocurrency, for retail as well as wholesale users in 2022 on a pilot basis.

**How can the Indian G20 Presidency shape Global Policy Dialogue on Crypto Assets?**

- **Broaden the discussion on crypto assets:** Beyond financial integrity concerns and capture the macroeconomic implications and widespread crypto adoption in the economy.
- **Inform policymakers**: On the broader macroeconomic and financial stability implications of crypto assets.
- **Highlight the consequences of crypto adoption:** On the internal and external stability of a country’s economy as well as on the structure of its financial system.

**Way Forward:**  [**IMF’s 9 points crypto asset action plan**](https://www.reuters.com/technology/imf-lays-out-crypto-action-plan-recommends-against-legal-tender-status-2023-02-24/) **–**

- **Safeguard monetary sovereignty and stability** by strengthening monetary policy frameworks and **do not grant crypto assets legal tender status.**
- Guard against excessive capital flow volatility and **maintain the effectiveness of capital flow management measures.**
- **Analyse and disclose fiscal risks** and adopt unambiguous tax treatment of crypto assets.
- Establish legal certainty of crypto assets and address legal risks.
- **Develop oversight requirements** for all crypto market actors.
- Establish a joint monitoring framework across different domestic agencies and authorities.
- **Establish international collaborative arrangements**.
- Monitor the impact of crypto assets on the stability of the international monetary system.
- Strengthen **global cooperation to develop digital infrastructures**.

 **Context:** For the first time ever, the**year-long commemoration of the birth anniversary of  Santh Sevalal** **Maharaj**, the Spiritual & Religious Leader of the **Banjara Community** is being celebrated by the Ministry of Culture, Government of India.

**About Santh Sevalal Maharaj:**

- Santh Sevalal Maharaj was born in the **Shivamogga district of Karnataka.**
- He is considered a **social reformer and spiritual teacher** of the Banjara community. He travelled across the country with his **Ladeniya Troup to serve especially the forest dwellers and nomadic tribes**.
- Due to his **extraordinary knowledge, excellent skills and spiritual background** in Ayurveda and Naturopathy, he was able to **dispel and eradicate myths and superstitions prevalent** in the tribal communities and brought about reforms in their way of life.

**Banjara Community**

- Banjara is a **nomadic tribe of India**and was the vital supply chain for villages.
- In 1871, the **Banjaras and several other tribes were brought under the Criminal Tribes Act.**
- The community was denotified in the 1950s but was listed under the **Habitual Offenders Act, 1952**.
- With roots in Rajasthan, Banjaras now live in several states and are known by different names like **Lambada or Lambadi in Andhra Pradesh, Lambani in Karnataka; Gwar or Gwaraiya in Rajasthan**.
- They are listed in various States as **Scheduled Caste (SC), Scheduled Tribe (ST), Other Backward Class (OBC) and Vimukta Jati/denotified tribes.**

### **Solar geoengineering**

 **Source:** [The Hindu](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/what-is-solar-geoengineering/article66539671.ece)

[Solar geoengineering, also called solar radiation modification](https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/what-solar-geoengineering), involves cooling the earth by radiating **absorbed sunlight back into space**.

 **Types of solar geoengineering**   

- **Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI)**
    - SAI includes **spraying large quantities of tiny particles (e.g. of Sulphur Dioxides)** into the earth’s stratosphere to reflect sunlight The **concept of SAI is derived from sulphur clouds released during volcanic eruptions**.
- **Marine cloud brightening**
    - Marine cloud brightening proposes spra**ying sea salt into low-lying clouds to increase their brightness and the ability to reflect sunlight.**

 **Why is it controversial?**
