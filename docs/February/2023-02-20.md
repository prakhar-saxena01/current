### [The SC on sealed cover jurisprudence](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/20/the-sc-on-sealed-cover-jurisprudence/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Structure, Organization, and Functioning of the Executive and the Judiciary**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/on-sealed-cover-jurisprudence/article66529943.ece) 

**Context:** The CJI refused the ‘suggestions’ of the government in a sealed cover on the formation of a proposed committee to enquire into the Hindenburg report on the Adani Group.

**What is sealed cover jurisprudence?**

- It is a practice (origins can be traced to service or administrative cases) used by the **SC and sometimes lower courts**, of asking/accept information from government agencies in sealed envelopes **that can only be accessed by judges.**
- While **a specific law does not define** the doctrine of sealed cover, the SC derives its power to use it from the SC Rules 2013 and the Indian Evidence Act 1872.
- R**ecent times have seen the government produce myriad documents** (such as the Rafale jets’ purchase deal, and the Ayodhya title dispute) as sealed covers, resulting in the doctrine rising to the status of ‘due procedure’.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Sealed Cover Jurisprudence**|   |
|**Pros**|**Cons**|
|●        To avoid harm to the reputation of public servants.<br><br>●        To protect the identity of rape victims.<br><br>●        Disclosure can endanger **national security and public order.**|●        The other parties are unable to defend themselves.<br><br>●        Against the **principles of natural justice and the fundamental right to know.**<br><br>●        Threaten the very **credibility of the judicial institution** (‘open court’ principle).|

**Way ahead (The SC’s rulings):**

- The government should claim a **‘specific privilege’** and **explain the “extenuating circumstances”** to keep documents secret from the other party.
- **The burden would lie on the government** to prove that sharing copies of the records would prove detrimental to national security and public order.
- The sealed covers could be used **only in a “small exception” of cases.**

**Ethical Issues concerned:**

- **The use of Sealed Covers** raises ethical concerns **about transparency and fairness** in judicial proceedings.
- **Right to Know vs. National Security**
- **Erosion of Public Confidence** in the Judicial System
- **The principles of natural justice and the fundamental right** to **know** cannot be taken away by the state

**Conclusion:** The debate on sealed covers should focus on how to strike a balance between the public’s right to know and the necessity to preserve national security.

### [How is the stock market regulated in India?](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/20/how-is-the-stock-market-regulated-in-india/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Indian economy and related issues**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/explained-how-is-the-stock-market-regulated-in-india/article66526291.ece#:~:text=governing%20the%20market%3F-,The%20securities%20market%20in%20India%20is%20regulated%20by%20four%20key,and%20the%20Depositories%20Act%2C%201996.) 

**Context:** The SC recently asked the SEBI and the government to produce the existing regulatory framework in place to protect investors from share market volatility. 

**Background:**

- This followed the **Hindenburg Research report**, which accused the Adani Group of stock market manipulation and accounting fraud.
- **A share/a stock market** is a component of a free-market economy, where various kinds of stock shares/bonds/securities are traded.
- It allows companies **to raise money** and investors to participate in the financial achievements of the companies, makes profits through capital gains, and earn income through dividends. 

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/stock_mrket.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/stock_mrket.png)

**The securities market in India is regulated by four key laws:**

- **The Companies Act, 2013:** It regulates the incorporation of a company, responsibilities of a company, directors, and dissolution of a company.
- **The Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992:** It empowers SEBI to register intermediaries like stock brokers, merchant bankers, and portfolio managers, regulate their functioning, impose penalties including suspending/cancelling the registration
- **The Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (SCRA):** It empowers SEBI to recognise (and derecognise) stock exchanges, prescribe rules and bye-laws for their functioning, and regulate trading, clearing and settlement on stock exchanges.
- **The Depositories Act, 1996:** It introduced and legitimised the concept of dematerialised securities being held in an electronic form. SEBI set up the infrastructure for doing this by registering depositories and depository participants.

**Can SEBI step in to curb market volatility?**

- While SEBI does not interfere to prevent market volatility, **exchanges have circuit filters** (upper and lower) to prevent excessive volatility.
- **But SEBI can issue directions** to stock exchanges to stop trading, totally or selectively.
- It can also **prohibit entities or persons from buying, selling or dealing in securities**, or from raising funds from the market.

**What are the guidelines for fundraising?**

- **The Companies Act** has delegated the authority to enforce some of its provisions to **SEBI**, including the regulation of raising capital, corporate governance, resolution of investor grievances, etc.
- As a result, **SEBI issued guidelines** such as the Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirement Regulations, the Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements Regulations (2015), etc.

**What are the safeguards against fraud?**

- Fraud undermines regulation and **prevents a market from being fair and transparent**.
- SEBI notified the **Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices** Regulations (1995) and the **Prohibition of Insider Trading** Regulations (1992).
- These regulations **define different types of fraud**, and provide for penalties and violation of these regulations is a presumed violation of the **Prevention of Money Laundering Act**.
- SEBI has been given the **powers of a civil court** and using these powers, SEBI has acted against Satyam, Sahara India, Ketan Parekh and Vijay Mallya.
- **Appeals** – SEBI order → Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) → SC

Related news: SEBI has mandated stock brokers, and depository participants to maintain a website to help investors

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/sebi-mandates-stock-brokers-depository-website-8450531/#:~:text=Sebi%20has%20mandated%20these%20entities,better%20services%20to%20the%20investors.)

 **Context:** The capital markets regulator SEBI has recently asked stock brokers and depository participants to maintain a website.

**A stockbroker** (registered with SEBI) is a member of a recognised stock exchange, who is permitted to do trades on the screen-based trading system of different stock exchanges.

 **A depository** is an organisation which holds securities (like shares, debentures, bonds, etc.) of investors in electronic form at the request of the investors through a registered depository participant.

 **A depository participant** is an agent of the depository – National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL) and Central Depository Services (India) Ltd (CDSL) – through which it interfaces with the investor and provides depository services.

 **The rationale behind the website:** It will contain basic details such as their registered address, and the registration number, and **give customers relevant information right** from the process of opening an account to filing a complaint.

### [Why Environmental Surveillance for Avian Influenza is vital?](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/20/why-environmental-surveillance-for-avian-influenza-is-vital/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus:** **Issues related to Health**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/why-environmental-surveillance-for-avian-influenza-is-vital/article66521444.ece)

**Context:** Avian influenza (H5N1) or **bird flu** has caused unprecedented loss of tens of thousands of birds at Bass Rock, an island off the coast of North Berwick, Scotland.

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/bird_flu_1.jpg?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/bird_flu_1.jpg)**

**Avian Influenza in India:** The **latest major avian flu outbreak in 2020-2021** swept through many States causing mass mortality of wild birds.

**Challenges for India:**

- India is **a major wintering ground** for many waterfowl that rely on the central Asian Flyway.
- **Fastest growing egg producer** in the world.
- Unlike in Europe, **poultry birds here are not vaccinated against the flu**.
- Farms with a **diversity of animals or in the vicinity** of wetlands increase the potential for the viruses to generate more virulent strains – H5N1/H7N9 – **which could infect humans.**
- **There is no active surveillance** in the poultry sector.
- **There is no efficient mechanism** for how wetland and waterfowl habitats at the interface of poultry need to be monitored.

**Environmental surveillance – Meaning and need:**

 **Meaning:** It can improve knowledge of the presence and diversity of avian influenza viruses in domestic flocks that are allowed to roam/in confinement where waste products like faeces, etc. are released into the environment.

 **N****eed:**

- Birds infected with the virus **shed large quantities of virus** in their faeces, saliva, and nasal secretions for about a week.
- **Zoonotic potential:**
    - Transmission from dead birds to scavenging animals such as sea lions, and foxes, has posed serious risks.
    - Recently, the intra-mammal transmission of H5N1 (in mink farms) was recorded.
- **Lakes and wetlands can act as environmental reservoirs** for several months.

**Way ahead:** An active and passive year-round surveillance network under **One Health** which connects monitoring of humans and animals in a shared environment.

**Conclusion:** Currently, virus surveillance relies on sampling dead birds. Therefore, environmental surveillance would be a great non-invasive tool that can be done without disturbing the birds and can be used to obtain both host and viral genetic material.

### **Efforts against Child Marriage**

 **Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/odishas-silent-assault-on-child-marriage/article66508858.ece)

 **Odisha** in India has been successful in **reducing child marriage** rates through a long-term strategy that involves:

- **Tracking the absence of girls** in schools and villages
- **Counselling** by representatives of district administration
- **Linking all schemes targeting girls** on a platform called **‘Advika – Every Girl is Unique**.’
- **Monetary incentives** to vulnerable tribal groups
- **Child-friendly policing** and sensitization week
- **Community efforts for behavioural changes:** Representatives of the panchayat, parents, and children conduct monthly meetings in the community to discuss dropping out from school and child marriages

**Usage**: This can be used in Ethics (Case Studies) or as an example in the Governance/Social Justice/ Society Questions

### **Global Anti-Caste Efforts**

**Source**: [IE](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/in-the-us-a-big-step-against-caste-discrimination-8453292/), [DTE](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/governance/caste-is-not-unique-to-india-and-south-asia-a-development-in-spain-shows-how-87792)

**Example 1:** The City Council in Seattle (USA) will vote on a law, to ban caste discrimination in employment and housing, retail, public accommodation, and transportation.

**Example 2:** Institutions of higher education across the USA have added caste to their non-discrimination policies.

**Example 3:** A report in Spain has recommended Spanish Government the equal treatment and opportunities for the **Roma** to build a better society and eradicate **Anti-Gypsy sentiments**. The position of the Roma in Europe is similar to that of the **Dalits** in India.

Bottom of Form

**Lessons from the above examples:**

- **Discrimination and marginalization** based on caste or ethnicity are still prevalent in various parts of the world, including the US and Europe.
- **Grassroots movements and advocacy efforts** can raise awareness and drive positive change to combat discrimination and social injustice.
- **Non-discrimination policies** at the institutional level can help to create a more inclusive society.

**Usage:** Such examples can be used in Essay/Ethics/ Society/ Social Justice to show that caste-based discrimination is prevalent throughout the world and there is a need for concerted global efforts to eradicate such biases.

### **Bio-Engineering to fight Climate Change**

**Source**: [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/16/science/genetically-modified-trees-living-carbon.html)

**Living Carbon**, a San Francisco-based biotech firm, has planted genetically modified (GM) **poplar trees** that grow wood at a **much faster rate** and absorb more CO2 than normal trees.

- The company used a technique known as the **gene gun method** to insert foreign genes into the trees’ chromosomes.
- **Threats**: Critics have warned they could be a “growing threat” to forests biodiversity, and the government has allowed the trees to evade regulation.
- To date, the only country where large numbers of GM trees have been planted in **China**

**Usage**: This example can be used to show innovative techniques to sequester carbon, but it can also be used to show ethical, environmental, and regulatory issues with the bio-engineering of plants.

- Vinyl chloride is a **colourless gas that burns easily**. It does not occur naturally and must be produced industrially for its commercial uses.
- Vinyl chloride is used primarily to make **polyvinyl chloride (PVC),** a hard plastic resin used to make a variety of plastic products, including pipes, wire and cable coatings, and packaging materials.
- Its health risks **were discovered in the 1970s**when four workers involved in the polymerization process for producing polyvinyl chloride there each **developed angiosarcoma of the liver, an extremely rare type of tumour.**

 **Context:** India’s first **hybrid-sounding rocket** by private players was launched from **Tamil Nadu’s Pattipulam.**

**About the mission:**

- Martin Foundation, in association with Dr APJ Abdul Kalam International Foundation and Space Zone India, launched the **Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Satellite Launch Vehicle Mission- 2023.**
- The selected students designed and constructed a **student satellite launch vehicle (rocket) and 150 PICO satellite research experiment cubes that contained different payloads.**
- The reusable rocket was made by the **selected top 100 students**, while the rest made the satellites. The rocket can be used for **research in weather, atmospheric conditions, and radiation**.

**About Hybrid Sounding rocket:**

- A hybrid-sounding rocket is a type of rocket that uses a **hybrid rocket engine to power its flight**.
- A hybrid rocket engine uses a **solid fuel grain and a liquid or gaseous oxidizer to generate thrust**.
- Hybrid-sounding rockets are often used by universities, government agencies, and private companies for scientific research and testing of new technologies because of their low cost.

 **Context:** Researchers from Weill Cornell Medicine, US, have created an **experimental contraceptive** drug candidate that “**temporarily stops sperm in their tracks and prevents pregnancies in preclinical models**.”

**More about the experimental study:**

- **It was conducted on mice wherein a** single dose of a cellular signalling protein called soluble adenylyl cyclase – **sAC inhibitor**, called TDI-11861, was found to immobilize its sperm for up to two and half hours, and effects persist in the **female reproductive tract after mating**.
- After three hours, some sperm begin regaining motility; **by 24 hours, nearly all sperm have recovered normal movement.**

 **Context**: As per the recent **Botanical Survey of India (BSI) publication**; **Darjeeling and Sikkim Himalayas** are home to **more than one-third** of all types of rhododendrons found in India

**About Rhododendrons:** 

- **Name**: Rhododendron meaning rose tree in Greek
- **Ecological Significance:** It is considered an indicator species for climate change
- **Nature**: Evergreen to Deciduous in nature (can be in form of dwarf shrubs to large trees)
- **Threats**: Rampant construction
- **Habitat**: Cold, moist deep valleys of the eastern Himalayas
- State tree of Uttarakhand and the state flower of Nagaland
    - It’s blooming in the Garhwal Himalayas and is celebrated **as ‘Phool Sankranti’**, a festival of flowers.
- It is **native**to many regions of the world, including Asia, Europe, North America, and Australia

### **Underwater noise emissions (UNE)**

 **Source**: [TH](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/underwater-noise-emissions-by-ships-pose-threat-to-marine-species-says-study/article66524789.ece#:~:text=The%20rising%20man%2Dmade%20(anthropogenic,%2C%20Seal%2C%20and%20Sperm%20Whale.)

**Context**: As per a recent study, the rising anthropogenic (man-made) underwater noise emissions (UNE) from ships in Indian waters, pose a threat to the life of marine mammals.

**Importance of Sound for Marine Animals**: All Marine Mammals (like Bottlenose Dolphin, Manatees, Pilot Whale, Seal, and Sperm) use sound for mating, communal interaction, feeding, cluster cohesion and foraging

**Threats**: The sound that radiates from ships on a long-term basis affects their behavioural activities, and also results in internal injuries, loss of hearing ability, masking, and stress

- Change the migration route of marine species to shallow regions, leading to **stranding**

**UNE in Indian waters:**

- It is measured to be between 102-115 decibels
- East Coast sound level is slightly higher than the West

**Major Contributors to UNE:**

- **Natural**: Earthquakes, Weather, and Sound released by marine animals
- **Anthropogenic**:
    - Continuous shipping movement is identified to be a significant contributor to the increase in the global ocean noise level.
    - The noise generated by ships is caused by their engines, propellers, and other machinery, and it can travel long distances through the water
    - Oil and gas exploration
    - Military sonar
    - Construction
    - Recreational boating
