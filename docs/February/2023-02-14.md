### [How are Governors appointed, and why is their role often controversial?](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/14/how-are-governors-appointed-and-why-is-their-role-often-controversial/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus:** **Constitution of India – significant provision; Structure, organisation and functioning of the Executive**

**Source:** [**LM**](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/president-droupadi-murmu-appoints-new-governors-for-various-states-full-list-11676179456971.html) 

**Context:** Twelve states and the UT of Ladakh will have new Governors including both first-time appointments as well as transfers of Governors from one state to the other.

[**Appointment of the Governor**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/functions-and-responsibilities-of-the-union-and-the-states-issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure-devolution-of-powers-and-finances-up-to-local-levels-and-challenges-therein/issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure/governors-role/) **– Constitutional provisions:**

- **Article 153:** There shall be a Governor for each State and the same **person can be the Governor for two/more States** (2nd part added through an amendment in 1956).
- **Article 155**: Governor of a State shall be **appointed by the President** by warrant under his hand and seal.
- **Article 156:** The Governor shall hold office during the **pleasure of the President**, but his normal term of office **will be five years**.
    - Since the President acts on the aid and advice of the PM and the Union Council of Ministers, **the Governor is appointed and removed by the central government.**
- **Articles 157 and 158**:
    - **Qualification:** The Governor must be a **citizen of India** and should have completed the age of **35**
    - **Condition of office:** The Governor should not be a member of Parliament or a state legislature, and **must not hold any other office of profit.**

[**Relationship between the Governor and the state government:**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/03/12/insights-into-editorial-the-office-of-the-governor/)

- The position of the Governor is envisaged as **an apolitical head** who must **act on the advice** of the Council of Ministers of the state **(Article 163).**
- However, the Governor enjoys certain **discretionary powers** under the Constitution, such as
    - Giving or withholding **assent to a Bill** passed by the state legislature;
    - Determining the **time needed for a party to prove its majority** in the state Assembly;
    - In cases of a **hung verdict** in an election, which party must be called first to prove its majority

**Analysing the functioning of the Governor’s office over the years:**

- Over the decades, Governors have been **seen** (especially by those in opposition) **as acting –**
    - **At the behest of the central government**
    - As “**agents of the Centre**”

**Why does such** [**friction**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/01/07/insights-into-editorial-maximum-governor-on-governors-role/) **take place?**

- Governors have become **political appointees**
- The Governor is answerable to no one except the Centre
- There is **no provision for impeaching the Governor**

**Recommendations:**

- **The Sarkaria Commission (1983):** The appointee shall be an eminent person.
- **The National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution (2000):** A time limit, preferably six months to give assent or to reserve a Bill for consideration of the President.
- **The Punchhi Commission (2007):** Amend Article 156 to provide a procedure to remove the Governor from office.

**Conclusion:** There are no guidelines for how the Governor and the state must interact when there is a disagreement. Respect for each other’s boundaries, which has traditionally been a practice, should serve as guidance in this.

**Source**: [IE](https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/meity-may-soon-integrate-chatgpt-with-whatsapp-for-key-government-schemes-8441010/)

**What is ChatGPT?**

ChatGPT is an [**AI**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/science-technology/robotics/artificial-intelligence-and-robotics/)**-powered chatbot** developed by the **AI startup OpenAI.** The technology functions by leveraging extensive data to learn how to respond to user prompt in a human-like manner, providing information similar to a search engine. 

**What is a Chatbot?**

A chatbot is a software that simulates **human-like conversations** with users via chat. 

**A chatGPT-based chatbot can help rural India in several ways:** 

- **Providing access to information**: E.g. healthcare, education, agriculture, and government schemes.
    - In a recent demo, the Chatbot seamlessly responded to a query on **PM Awas Yojana**– made through a voice note.
- **Improving access to services**: E.g. banking, insurance, and healthcare. This can help bridge the gap between urban and rural areas and improve the quality of life for rural residents.
- **Providing language support**: It supports multiple languages. More languages are being integrated through [**Bhashini Daan Mission**](https://bhashini.gov.in/en/).
- **Enhancing** [**financial inclusion**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Financial-Inclusion-in-India.pdf)**:** By promoting financial literacy and encouraging savings among rural residents.

### **Doctrine of Necessity**

 **Source**: [BS](https://www.business-standard.com/article/opinion/a-question-of-quorum-123021200876_1.html) 

**Context**: Recently, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) invoked the **“doctrine of necessity**” to clear six deals involving mergers & acquisitions (M&A) and investment proposals.

**About Doctrine of Necessity:** The doctrine of necessity enables the legal authorities to take certain actions that must be taken at a particular moment, beyond the legal mandate.

**The issue in the present case:**

In this case, Competition Act stipulates there should be **at least three members** quorum to approve deals. However, after CCI’s chairperson retired in October 2022, there are only two members.

- Applying the doctrine, the **CCI formed a two-member quorum**, to clear delayed applications for M&A and other investment proposals.
- The law ministry approved the **corporate affairs ministry** ( CCI’s administrative ministry) to do so.

**About CCI:**

**The CCI is a statutory body (under**  **Competition Act, 2002)** **which acts as the** competition regulator in India. The Commission was established in **2003** (although became fully functional in 2009)

### **Palm  oil**

**Source**: [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/india-seen-coping-with-indonesia-curbs-palm-oil-exports-2023-02-13/)

**Context**: Indonesia, the **world’s largest exporter** of Palm Oil will suspend some export permits to cool domestic cooking oil prices

**Impact on India:**

- **Less impact:** India is one of the top consuming markets for palm oil, but the government has built higher stocks of palm oil
- **Higher global prices** may incentivize Indian farmers to bring more land under Oil Palm plantations

**What is Palm Oil?**

Palm oil is an **edible vegetable oil** derived from the **mesocarp** (**edible part of the fruit** ) of oil palm trees (indigenous to Africa and South America). It is rich in **vitamins A and E** with no trans fatty acids.

### **What are microLED displays, and why is Apple shifting to it?**

 **Source:** [**The Hindu**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/what-are-microled-displays-and-why-is-apple-shifting-to-it/article66500256.ece) 

**Context**: MicroLEDs are considered the next big transition in display technology as many big tech companies are shifting towards it.

 **About MicroLEDs:**

- micro-LEDs are **self-illuminating diodes** that have **brighter and better colour reproduction** than Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) display technology.

**The technology behind it:**

- A microLED is as **small as cutting a centimetre of hair into 200 smaller pieces**.
- Each of these **micro LEDs is a semiconductor that receives electric signals**. Once these micro LEDs are gathered, they form a module. Several modules are then combined to form screens.

**Micro-LED vs LED vs OLED**

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
||**Micro LEDs**|**LED**|**OLED**|
|**Features**|They are similar to OLEDs – but with an inorganic LED structure.|**LCD displays that use LED as backlighting units**|They use **tiny sub-pixels made from organic emissive materials**|
|**Advantages**|P**romise to be much more efficient and bright, more durable (higher lifetime), and with a higher colour gamut**.<br><br>**Relatively easy to scale up.**|**Cheaper**||
|**Drawbacks**|**Higher Cost**|Bad image quality.<br><br>**Difficulty in achieving flexibility and high-quality transparency.**|**Low Brightness, Short Lifespan**|

### **Forever Chemicals**

 **Source**: [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/11/pfas-norwegian-arctic-ice-wildlife-risk-stressor#:~:text=Alarming%20levels%20of%20PFAS%20in%20Norwegian%20Arctic%20ice%20pose%20new%20risk%20to%20wildlife,-Oxford%20University%2Dled&text=Norwegian%20Arctic%20ice%20is%20contaminated,region's%20wildlife%2C%20new%20research%20finds.) 

**Context**: An Oxford study has found that the Norwegian Arctic ice is contaminated with alarming levels of toxic PFAS (Per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances, also called “forever chemicals”).

**Impact of PFAS:**

- These chemicals are **persistent and can** [**bioaccumulate**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/basic-concepts-of-ecosystem/bioaccumulation-biomagnification/) in living organisms, potentially causing health and environmental risks.
- **Risk of further contamination:** The chemicals can move from glaciers into downstream ecosystems like Arctic fjords and tundra.
- **It affects the entire** [**food web**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/basic-concepts-of-ecosystem/trophic-level-food-chain-food-web/food-chain-and-food-web/), including plankton, fish, seal and apex animals like polar bears, and thus impact local communities

**What is PFAS?**
