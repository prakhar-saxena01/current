#### **GS Paper 1**

**Syllabus:** **Modern Indian History from about the middle of the eighteenth century until the present- significant events, personalities, issues**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/treaty-of-alinagar-bengal-east-india-company-colonial-rule-significance-explained-8436147/)

 **Context:** The Treaty of Alinagar strengthened the position of the British in Bengal and laid foundations for the Battle of Plassey a few months later.

- The treaty was the prelude to the **British seizure of Bengal**.

**The Treaty of Alinagar:**

- It was signed on **9 February 1757** between the British East India Company (**Robert Clive**) and the Nawab of Bengal (**Siraj ud-Daulah**).
- **Alinagar** was the short-lived name given to Calcutta by the Nawab after it was captured by him.
- Although the Nawab had taken control of the English fort in Calcutta, he signed the pact in response to the **English military might and the threat posed by Afghans** (under Ahmad Shah Abdali).

**Terms of the treaty:** The Nawab would recognize all the provisions of **Mughal Emperor Farrukhsiyar’s farman of 1717** – exempt from paying duties on goods passed through Bengal, can fortify Calcutta, mint coins in Calcutta, etc.

**Significance of the treaty:**  The signing of the treaty was one of the events leading up to the famous Battle of Plassey, which set the stage for **British colonial expansion in India**.

Timeline of the initial phase of British Imperialism in India:

- **1600** – The English East India Company was formed by a royal charter – A monopoly of all trade from England in the East.
- **1613** – A royal Farman from Mughal emperor **Jehangir** allowed the Company to open its factories and warehouses.
    - **T**he Company worked **subservient** to local rulers and established a thriving business.
    - The three primary trading towns where the British trade thrived were **Bombay, Madras, and Calcutta** (which account for 60% of all English imports from Asia).
- **After 1707 (the death of Aurangzeb)** – The Mughal emperor remained the symbolic head, however, his actual power was fast diminishing.
- **1717** – The Mughal emperor Farrukhsiyar’s farman gave favourable terms to the Company to trade in Bengal, this was met with local opposition.
- **1717 -1727** – Nawab Murshid Quli Khan, the new autonomous ruler of Bengal, refused to extend the 1917 farmaan.
- **1755** – Worried about French competition, the English began renovating the fortifications in Calcutta without Nawab’s permission.
- **1756** – Nawab Siraj ud Daula’s forces captured **Fort William**, Calcutta, and renamed it Alinagar.
- **February 9, 1757:** Treaty of Alinagar – the eventual rise of the East India Company as a political force to be reckoned with.
- **June 23, 1757** – Battle of Plassey. The Company began territorial control that would serve its economic interests.

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus****: Environmental Pollution**

**Source:** [**Indian Express**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/how-the-e-waste-you-produce-is-providing-poor-children-with-a-dangerous-living-8435127/)

**Context: Rising number of children in the extraction of the** [**e-waste**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/environment-pollution-and-control/waste-management/e-waste/) **sector** is a crude and hazardous process that goes unregulated.

- According to the **Global E-waste Monitor 2020**, the world dumped 53.6 million metric tons of e-waste in 2019**. India produced 3.2 million metric tons** of e-waste, much of which is dumped for dismantling and recycling in Seelampur with no regulations.

**About e-waste:**

- The term electronic and electrical waste (e-waste) refers to “**electrical or electronic equipment, which is waste, including all components, subassemblies, and consumables, which are part of the equipment at the time the equipment becomes waste** ”.
- E-waste includes large, discarded appliances, such as **refrigerators, air conditioners, and washing machines, as well as small personal items, including computers, televisions, mobile phones, and many other devices that are operated by electrical currents or batteries.**

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/toxic_1.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/toxic_1.png)**

**What health risks are the children exposed to?**

- **Toxic substances**: Toxic substances such as **lead, cadmium, mercury, and flame retardants, can be harmfu**l if not properly disposed of. **Serious skin diseases and chronic lung infections** due to continuous exposure to these chemical-laden toxins.
- **Disabilities**: Even relatively **low lead exposure in children** can result in a **reduction in total intelligence quotient (IQ) and several behavioural abnormalities**, including a decrease in attention span and an increase in frustration and disruptive behaviour.
- **Exposure to hazardous waste:** Like Nickel, Mercury can cause long-term incurable diseases.
- **Environmental contamination**: Contaminated soil and water potentially affect the health of local populations, including children.
- **Loss of access to educational opportunities**: In some developing countries, e-waste dumping has caused environmental degradation and health problems, **leading to school closures and limiting children’s access to education.**

**India’s initiatives to tackle e-waste:**

- **Extended Producer Responsibility; Design for Environment; (3Rs) Reduce, Reuse, Recycle technology platform** for linking the market facilitating the **circular economy** aim to encourage consumers to **correctly dispose of the e-waste.**
- [E-waste (Management) rules 2022](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/11/11/government-notified-e-waste-management-rules-2022/)
- India has tried to tackle this unregulated industry and **introduced a series of laws in 2011 and 2016** **mandating the authorization and registration of all e-waste recycling facilities**, along with directives for workers to use protective equipment while dismantling the waste.
- India’s first e-waste clinic to be set up in Bhopal

**Way Forward:**

**Recycling electronic devices through certified e-waste recycling programs** or donating them to organizations that can reuse them can help reduce the issue of e-waste.

**Mains link:**

**Q. Electronic waste, or e-waste, is becoming major a domestic and global issue. Discuss the steps that must be taken to ensure the safe disposal of e-waste in the country. (15M)**
