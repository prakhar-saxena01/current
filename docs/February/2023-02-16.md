### [SC junks challenge to J&K delimitation: what did the petitioner, Centre argue?](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/16/sc-junks-challenge-to-jk-delimitation-what-did-the-petitioner-centre-argue/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Government policies and interventions for development in various sectors and issues arising out of their design and implementation**

**Source:** [IE](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/sc-junks-challenge-to-jk-delimitation-what-did-the-petitioner-centre-argue-8442254/)

 **Context:** The SC dismissed a plea challenging the [delimitation exercise](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/02/07/delimitation-panel-2/) to redraw Lok Sabha and Assembly constituencies in the Union Territory of J&K.

**Background:**

- A [challenge to the J&K Reorganisation Act, 2019](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/01/why-constitutional-validity-of-jk-reorganisation-act-cause-went-unchallenged-sc/), is pending before the apex court, along with other petitions challenging the abrogation of **Article 370** of the Indian Constitution.
- [Delimitation](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/02/18/delimitation-of-constituencies-2/) is the act of redrawing boundaries of an Assembly or LS seat **to represent changes in population over time**.
- [A commission](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/03/30/delimitation-commission/) set up by the Central government submitted its final report for delimitation in J&K last year.
- It has been recommended that the number of seats in the J&K Assembly should be raised **from 83 to 90.**

**Arguments of the petitioner:**

- After the notification of the Parliamentary and Assembly Constituencies **Delimitation Order, 2008**, **only the Election Commission of India** could have undertaken the exercise.
- The delimitation exercise violates **Article 170 of the Constitution**, under which constituencies shall remain frozen till the first census is conducted after the year 2026.
- The increase in seats violates provisions of **Articles 81, 82, 170, 330, and 332** of the Constitution, and Section 63 of the 2019 Act.

**Arguments of the Centre:**

- The J&K Reorganisation Act 2019 mandates the setting up of a commission for the exercise.

Delimitation exercise:

**Legal/constitutional provisions:**

●        **Article 82:** Following each census, the allocation of Lok Sabha seats to the states, as well as the division of each state into territorial constituencies, shall be readjusted by such authority as **Parliament may by law determine.**

●        **Section 8A of the** [Representation of the People Act, 1950:](https://www.insightsonindia.com/governance/elections-in-india/acts-associated-with-elections-in-india/salient-features-of-the-representation-of-peoples-act-1950/) It allows for delimitation of Parliamentary and Assembly constituencies in Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur or Nagaland.

●        **Article 170** (Composition of the Legislative Assemblies): Census figures (2001) shall be used for the purpose of readjustment of constituencies in the State.

●        **Reservation of seats** for the SCs/STs will be provided as per Articles 330 (Lok Sabha) and 332 (State Assemblies) of the Constitution.

**Delimitation Commission:**

●        Delimitation is the responsibility of a high-level body known as the Delimitation Commission or a Boundary Commission, whose orders have the force of law and **cannot be challenged in court.**

●        **Article 82** of the Indian Constitution provides for the establishment of such a commission through a **Parliamentary act.**

●        The orders will take effect on a date to be determined by India’s **President**.

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: Government policies and Interventions**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/explained-does-indias-mental-healthcare-act-2017-protect-patients-rights-and-dignity-in-institutions/article66503295.ece)

**Context:**  NHRC in a recent report flagged the **“inhuman and deplorable**” condition of **all 46 government-run mental healthcare institutions** across the country (3 Central Run and the rest of state-run Institutions)

**What is Mental Health?**

It is a state of well-being in which every individual realizes his or her own potential, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively, and is able to make a contribution to her or his community. (WHO Definition)

- **For the status of Mental disorders in India:** [**Click here**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/06/09/insights-into-editorial-towards-a-stronger-mental-health-strategy/)
- **For a Range of Mental illnesses in society:** [**Click here**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/06/09/insights-into-editorial-towards-a-stronger-mental-health-strategy/) 

**Mental Healthcare Act, 2017(MHA)** has been called a “_watershed moment for the right to health movement in India_”. 

**Provisions of MHA**

- It **discourages long-term institutionalization** of patients and reaffirms the rights of people to live independently, and within communities.
    - This right is doubly guaranteed under **the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act of 2016**
    - The previous act — **the Mental Healthcare Act, 1987**—**prioritized the long-term institutionalization** of mentally-ill people and provided disproportionate authority to judicial officers and mental health establishments.
- **Attempt to Commit Suicide, not an Offence**: A person who attempts to commit suicide will be presumed to be “**suffering from severe stress’’** and shall not be subjected to any investigation or prosecution.
- **Promotes community living:** The government was made responsible for **creating opportunities to access less restrictive options** for community living — such as halfway homes, sheltered accommodations, rehab homes, and supported accommodations.
- **Discourages using physical restraints** (such as chaining), objects to unmodified electro-convulsive therapy (ECT)
- Establishment of **Central Mental Health Authority and State Mental Health Authority**
- **It provides the following rights:**
    - **Right to Make an Advance Directive** about how to be treated or not to be treated for the illness during a mental health situation.
    - Right to Appoint a Nominated Representative
    - Right to access mental health care
    - **It pushes for the rights to hygiene**, sanitation, food, recreation, privacy, and infrastructure.
    - Right to get free medicines
    - Right to protection from cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment
    - Right to live in an environment, safe and hygienic, having basic amenities
    - Right to legal aid 

**What are the challenges to the implementation of the Act? (as highlighted by the NHRC report)**

- **Violation of Rights:**
    - **Illegal Confinement:** The facilities are “illegally” keeping patients long after their recovery
        - NHRC found that **almost 36.25%** of residential service users in state psychiatric facilities were living there for one year or more
        - It violates **Article 21 of the Constitution** (which protects personal liberty)
    - **Infringement of the human rights** of mentally ill patients
- **Infrastructure issues:**
    - **Shortage of facilities:** There are issues of shortage of doctors, lack of infrastructure, lack of community homes, homes for assisted living and socio-economic opportunities
- **Procedural Issues:**
    - **Non-compliance to MHA regulations** by the institutions
    - A majority of the States have not established **Central Mental Health Authority and State Mental Health Authority**
    - **Many States have not notified minimum standards** which are meant to ensure the quality of MHEs
    - **State Mental Health Authority** – which was required to meet at**least four times** every year, remained inactive **until August 2022**.
- **Societal Issues:**
    - **The social stigma** that looks at a person with mental illness as a “criminal” deserving of incarceration.
- **Poor budgetary allocation**and utilization of funds: It leads to Shelter homes remaining underequipped, understaffed, and undertrained

**Initiatives taken:**

- **Global Initiatives:**
    - World Mental Health Day is observed on 10th October every year

**Context:** According to the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), the highest number of custodial deaths has been reported in Gujarat (**80**) In the last five years.

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/states.jpg?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/states.jpg)

[Custodial deaths/extrajudicial killings](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/07/13/extra-judicial-killings/) **in India:**

**Meaning:**

- When an alleged accused has been prosecuted or killed **before receiving the orders of such prosecution from the court of law** is known as custodial violence/death.
- It violates the fundamental rights of a citizen under [Article 14 (Right to Equality), 21 (Right to Life), and 22 (Protection against arrest and detention in certain cases)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/indian-constitution/significant-provisions/fundamental-rights/) of the Indian Constitution.

**Reasons for the custodial deaths:**

- **Police under work pressure:** To improve their performance and conduct an investigation as soon as possible.
- **Punitive violence** (torture to deter those who are about to commit a crime).
- **Positive reinforcement:** Using shortcuts to get quick results.
- **Lack of proper training** for policemen.

**Laws regulating/prohibiting custodial deaths:**

- **The Indian Penal Code** (IPC Section-96): Every human being has the right to private defence.
- **The** **Criminal Procedure Code** (CrPC Section 46): Allows police to use all means necessary to arrest a detainee.
- **The Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act**: It gives the Indian Defense Forces broad powers to use lethal force in a variety of situations.

**Guidelines to prevent custodial deaths:** 

**The Central Government:** Issues advisories from time to time and has enacted the Protection of Human Rights Act (PHR), 1993, which stipulates the establishment of the [NHRC](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/statutory-regulatory-and-various-quasi-judicial-bodies/national-human-rights-commission/) **and SHRCs to look into alleged human rights violations by public servants.**

**NHRC:** 

- A magisterial inquiry (within 3 months) in all cases of deaths in the course of police action.
- Prompt prosecution and disciplinary action against delinquent officers.
- Denial of out-of-turn promotion, etc.

**SC (in the PUCL vs State of Maharashtra case 2014):** Laid down **16-point guidelines** for a thorough, effective and independent investigation in the cases of death during police encounters.

- Some of these are – An independent investigation > disciplinary action > **compensation** to be granted to the dependents of the victim.

**Way ahead:**

- Amend the Evidence Act to place the onus of proof on the police (Law Commission).
- **To sensitize public servants** (through NHRC’s workshops, and seminars) for a better understanding of the human rights of persons in custody.

**Conclusion:** Police and public order are **State subjects as per the** [7th Schedule](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/functions-and-responsibilities-of-the-union-and-the-states-issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure-devolution-of-powers-and-finances-up-to-local-levels-and-challenges-therein/functions-and-responsibilities-of-the-union-and-the-states/7th-schedule/) of the Indian Constitution. Hence, it is primarily the responsibility of the state government concerned to ensure the protection of persons in custody.

    decreasing or stopped or wound up.** Only 28% of the respondents have confirmed that they are growing.
- **45 per cent** of the respondents were of the view that there **was no “ease of doing” that exists in starting, running, or closing or in their living style,** while only 21 percent of the respondents stated that the government has supported MSMEs adequately during the Covid-19 pandemic.
- **Around 42 percent of respondents cited profit margin** concerns as one of the main challenges for entrepreneurs, 70 percent are worried about delayed payment receipts, and 40 percent are on raw material price and availability.
- **52 percent of respondents** found adherence to **statutory compliances as tough, while 62 percent are worried about demand and order book position and 38 percent have fear of manpower sourcing and employability skills in the youth.**

**Challenges in the MSMEs sector that hinder it from reaching its potential**

- Access to Credit
- Poor Infrastructure
- Access to Modern Technology
- Access to markets
- Legal hurdles

### [Sea-level rise a major threat to India, other nations: WMO](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/16/sea-level-rise-a-major-threat-to-india-other-nations-wmo/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus:** **Environment, Conservation**

**Source:** [**HT**](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sealevel-rise-a-major-threat-to-india-other-nations-wmo-101676400422024.html)

 **Context:** The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) cautioned that [sea level rise](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/sea-level-rise) poses a serious threat to both China and India in a report titled “**Global Sea-Level Rise and Implications**.”

**Findings of the “Global Sea-Level Rise and Implications” report:**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/rise_sea.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/rise_sea.png)

- [Sea level rise varies](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/09/24/insights-into-editorial-sea-level-rise-is-certain/) **regionally**
- It will encroach upon Infrastructure and coastal communities will be encroached upon
- **It affects a number of major cities on every continent**: Shanghai, Dhaka, Bangkok, Jakarta, Mumbai, Copenhagen, New York, Buenos Aires, Santiago, etc.
- Poses a significant **economic, social, and humanitarian problem** (threatens coastal farmlands, water reserves, the resilience of infrastructures, food-nutrition security, human lives and livelihoods), especially in vulnerable areas.
- Along with other climate concerns, it will affect coastal ecosystems, related development and **beyond 1 billion people by 2050**
- Growing **Urbanization** in exposed areas will exacerbate the effects.
- It is reinforced by storm surges and tidal variations as seen during the landfall of hurricane **Sandy (New York) and Cyclone Idai (Mozambique)**

**Reasons** [behind sea-level rise](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/07/06/mission-2023-mindmap-sea-level-rise/)**:**

- Increase in average global temperature (by over 1°C since 1880)
- **Thermal expansion of seawater** (leading to mean sea level increasing by ~20 cm)
- Glacier and ice-sheet melt
- **Changes in groundwater storage.**

**Challenges:**

- According to the IPCC, melting ice sheets (the largest contributor to sea level change) **are hard to predict**.
- By 2150, global sea level rise is estimated to rise by roughly **4, 0.5 and 0.2 m** under high, mid and low-emission scenarios, respectively.
- Limiting 21st-century global surface temperature rise to 2 °C above the pre-industrial level ([Paris Agreement](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/07/08/financial-and-technological-commitments-under-unfccc-and-paris-agreement/)**’s target**) would be insufficient.

**Way ahead:**

- A low greenhouse gas emission scenario, with temperatures staying **below 1.5 °C**
- **Reaching net zero carbon emissions before 2060**.
- Particularly along the coast, urban systems must enable **climate-resilient development**

World Meteorological Organization (WMO):

 **Context:** ‘**The Parhaiyas of Jharkhand’** is a study that examines the level of penetration and coverage of government schemes and the bottlenecks that hinder their implementation.

**Parhaiya** is one of the nine [Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/12/03/particularly-vulnerable-tribal-group-pvtg/) (**PVTGs**) of Jharkhand state (one of the 75 in the country).

**Food and pension schemes:**

- In Jharkhand, **88% of PVTG** households were on the PDS list and under the **Antyodaya scheme.**
- The Jharkhand government introduced the **Adim Jan Jati Pension** (AJJP in 2025) scheme, which provides ₹600 every month to such households.

**Issues faced in the implementation of schemes:**

- **Lack of proper education**.
- Many, including children, were forced to enter **exploitative labour contracts**.
- **Lack of a new ration card or Aadhar-related** issues (biometric authentication) resulted **in 12%** of households not having access to such schemes.
- The poor levels of **digital infrastructure** in the rural population.

**A long way to go:** More schemes and policies that promote **long-term solutions** such as **stable employment and education along with maternity and healthcare benefits** must be introduced.

### **‘Transfer Pricing’ rules**

**Source**: [IE](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/what-are-transfer-pricing-rules-bbc-8445059/), [IE](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/bbc-offices-it-department-survey-raid-searches-explained-8444621/),

**Context**: The IT Department surveys were conducted at the BBC office, in view of the BBC’s **“deliberate non-compliance with the transfer pricing rules**” and its “vast diversion of profits”

- BBC has not followed the **“arm’s length arrangement”** in the allocation of profit
- Transfer pricing laws in India are codified in the **Income-tax Act, 1961** 

**What is Transfer Pricing?** 

Transfer pricing refers to prices of transactions or transfers of goods, services and technology between related enterprises or between unrelated parties but controlled by a common entity.

- Companies use transfer pricing to **reduce the overall tax burden of the parent company**. The effect of transfer pricing is that the parent company **tends to produce insufficient taxable income** or excessive loss on a transaction. 

**How does transfer pricing work?**

Suppose a company **A purchases goods for 100 rupees** and sells them to its **associated company B** in another country for 200 rupees, who in turn sells in the open market for 400 rupees.

Had A sold it (the good) direct, it would have made a profit of 300 rupees. But by routing it through B, it (A) restricted it (profit) to 100 rupees, permitting B to appropriate the balance.

**What is the ‘arm’s length price’?**

The price at which a **willing buyer and a willing unrelated seller** would freely agree to transact or trade between related parties is conducted as if they were unrelated so that there is no conflict of interest in the transaction. 

**Difference between an IT Survey and Raid?** 

Tax officials during a survey can not remove any cash, stock or other valuable article or thing. During searches or raids, officials can seize accounts or valuable articles.

### **Haircut**

 **Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/china-must-take-a-haircut-on-its-loans-to-poor-countries-says-indias-g20-sherpa/article66512408.ece#:~:text=Beijing%20needs%20to%20come%20out,settle%20it%2C%20says%20Amitabh%20Kant&text=China%20must%20agree%20to%20take,Chinese%20debt%20of%20developing%20nations.)

 **Context:** India has asked **China to take a haircut on its loans to poor countries** and assist their economic recovery.

- India has specified that **International Monetary Fund [IMF] taking a haircut** to settle Chinese debt is unsustainable.

**What is a Haircut in the Economy?** 

When a bank or creditor country takes a ‘haircut’, it means **it accepts less than what was due in a particular loan accoun**t. For example: if a bank (e.g. IMF) was owed Rs 10,000 cr by a borrower (e.g. Pakistan) and it agrees to take back only Rs 8,000 cr, it takes a 20% haircut (or loss).

**Context:** India cuts windfall tax on crude oil to Rs 1,900 per tonne from Rs 2,100 per tonne

- India imposed the **windfall profit tax, in July 2022**, joining nations that tax supernormal profits of energy companies.
- Levy was introduced in view of the **windfall gains** made by the **domestic crude producers** and refiners due to high global crude and product prices (on account of the Russian-Ukraine war)

**What is windfall tax?**

A windfall tax is a higher tax rate on sudden big profits levied on a particular company or industry.

Scientists at the **Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI)** developed InfoCrop (in 2015)—**India’s only dynamic crop simulation model**—to forecast **crop loss yield** due to heatwaves.

- The IARI model InfoCrop (which is available free of cost) has an **85% accuracy** for pre- or in-season crop yield forecasts.
- The IARI is now working on the third version of InfoCrop, which will be more **user-friendly and include models** for many other crops.

**Usage**: It can be used as an example to show the “use of technology (in agriculture) for mitigation of impact due to climate change).

**Did you know?**

Scientists have recently discovered a new variety of wheat with the **Rht13** **gene** (reduced-height wheat which can even grow in drier soil conditions). This different from Green Revolution genes **(Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b)**

### **What are volatiles?**

**Source:** [**The Hindu**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/what-are-volatiles/article66511493.ece)

 **Context:** A new research suggests that some of the **well-known volatiles, which form the basic part of Earth, may have come from beyond** the inner solar system.

**About Volatiles:**

- Volatiles are elements or compounds that **change from a solid or liquid state into vapour at relatively low temperatures.**
- The most common volatiles — **carbon dioxide, nitrogen, ammonia, hydrogen, methane, sulphur dioxide, and water**—are abundant in nature and necessary to living organisms.

**About the research:**

- The researchers **examined 18 meteorites** — **eleven from the inner Solar System, known as non-carbonaceous meteorites, and seven from the outer Solar System, known as carbonaceous meteorites.**
- For each meteorite, they measured the relative abundances of the five different forms — **or isotopes — of zinc.**
- They then compared each isotopic fingerprint with Earth samples to estimate how much each of these materials contributed to Earth’s zinc inventory. **The results suggest that while the Earth only incorporated about ten per cent of its mass from carbonaceous bodies, this material supplied about half of Earth’s zinc.**

### **Marburg virus**

 **Source:** [**The Hindu**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/marburg-virus-outbreak-infectious-disease-equatorial-guinea-explained/article66509798.ece)

 **Context:** Central African nation **Equatorial Guinea** confirmed its first outbreak of the highly infectious **Marburg virus disease or MVD.**

 **What is the Marburg virus disease?**

- Marburg virus disease is a highly **virulent disease** that causes **haemorrhagic fever**, with a fatality ratio of up to 88 per cent. It is in the same family as **the virus that causes Ebola virus disease.**

 **Symptoms:**

- Illness caused by the Marburg virus begins abruptly, with **high fever, severe headache, and severe malaise.** Many patients develop **severe haemorrhagic symptoms within seven days.**

**How does Marburg’s disease spread?**

- Like [Ebola](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/02/13/ebola/), the Marburg virus is **transmitted to primates from fruit bats**, which are considered natural hosts of the virus.
- It spreads **among humans via direct contact with the bodily fluids** of infected bats, or surfaces contaminated with fluids, like bedsheets.

**Is there any vaccine/treatment for Marburg disease?**

- There are **no vaccines or antiviral treatments** approved to treat the virus. However, supportive care – **rehydration with oral or intravenous fluids – and treatment of specific symptoms, improve survival.**

**Context:** A new beetle species ‘**Omorgus Khandesh’** has been discovered in India recently.

- The beetle is important for forensic science as it **helps detect the time of death of an animal or human.** 

**About Omorgus Khandesh:**

- Omorgus Khandesh is **necrophagous and is, therefore, also called a keratin beetle**.
- The new species belongs to the **Trogidae family**. With the addition of this new species, now there are a **total of 14 extant species of this family in India.**
- During the decomposition of a body, **blowflies are amongst the first ones to arrive in the early stages**. Meanwhile, the **final successional stage is with the arrival of the keratin feeders**, thus their importance in forensic science.
