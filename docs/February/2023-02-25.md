### [A brief history of the Khalistan movement](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/25/a-brief-history-of-the-khalistan-movement/)

#### **GS Paper 1**

 **Syllabus:** **Post-independence consolidation**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/amritpal-singh-khalistan-movement-punjab-history-8465056/)

 **Context:** Hundreds of followers of a radical preacher and **pro-Khalistan leader** (Amritpal Singh) clashed violently with police near Amritsar, demanding the release of one of their colleagues.

**Background:** Amritpal Singh is a follower of the slain Sikh militant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, and took the reins of the ‘**Waris Punjab De**’ organisation following the death of its founder (Deep Sidhu).

**What is the Khalistan movement?**

- It is **a Sikh separatist movement** seeking to create a homeland for Sikhs by establishing a sovereign state, called Khalistan (‘Land of the Khalsa’), in the Punjab region.
- Its origins have been traced back to **India’s independence and subsequent Partition along religious lines**.
    - **The Punjab province**, which was divided between India and Pakistan, witnessed communal violence and generated millions of refugees.
    - The historic Sikh Empire’s capital, **Lahore**, as well as sacred Sikh sites like Nankana Sahib, the birthplace of Guru Nanak, went to Pakistan.
- While most Sikhs found themselves in India, they were a small minority (2% of the population) in the country.
- The political struggle for greater autonomy began with the **Punjabi Suba Movement** for the creation of a Punjabi-speaking state.
- **The States Reorganisation Commission report (1955)** rejected this demand, but the state of Punjab was reorganised (**trifurcated** into the Hindi-Hindu-majority HP and Haryana, and Punjabi-Sikh-majority Punjab) in **1966**.
- The Punjabi Suba movement had galvanised the Akali Dal, which concluded the **Anandpur Sahib Resolution** (1973) demanding autonomy (not secession from India) for the state of Punjab.
- This demand had gone global by **1971** – when an advertisement in The New York Times proclaimed the **birth of Khalistan.**
- By the 1980s, the appeal of **Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale** had started creating trouble for the government.
- He and his followers (mostly from the lower rungs of the social ladder) were getting increasingly violent.
- In 1982, with support from the Akali Dal’s leadership, he launched a civil disobedience movement called the **Dharam Yudh Morcha** and took up residence inside the Golden Temple, directing demonstrations and clashes with the police.

**What was Operation Blue Star?**

- The Khalistan movement was crushed in India following **Operation Blue Star** (by the Indian Army to flush out militants from the Golden Temple and neutralise Bhindranwale in **1984**) and **Operation Black Thunder** (1986 and 1988).
- While the operations were ostensibly successful in their aims, they **gravely wounded** (by the desecration of the Golden Temple) the Sikh community around the world and also **galvanised the demand for Khalistan**.

**Aftermath of the Operation Blue Star:**

- PM **Indira Gandhi** was assassinated (on October 31, 1984), triggering the worst communal violence since Partition.
- Punjab became the hub of a **long drawn-out insurgency** (allegedly supported by Pakistan) that lasted till 1995.
- The movement **continues to evoke sympathy and support** among sections of the Sikh population, especially in the Sikh diaspora.
- Today, the movement is fuelled by **vote bank politics, social issues** (unemployment, [drug menace in Punjab](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/06/28/rstv-the-big-picture-fighting-drug-menace/)), dissatisfaction among the Sikh diaspora and support from non-state actors.

**Conclusion:** In order to curb the Khalistan movement and ideology, the Indian government needs to address the above-mentioned issues.

### [The Foundational Literacy and Numeracy Report](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/25/the-foundational-literacy-and-numeracy-report/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Issues Relating to Development and Management of Social Sector/Services relating to Education**

**Source:** [**PIB**](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1901882)

 **Context:** The 2nd edition of the Foundational Literacy and Numeracy (FLN) report was released by Dr Bibek Debroy, Chairman EAC-PM.

**FLN:**

- It is the ability of a child (between the ages of 3 and 8 years old) **to read basic texts and do basic mathematical problems** such as addition and subtraction.
- It is one of the main elements of the [National Education Policy **(NEP) 2020.**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/issues-related-to-education-sector/new-education-policy/)

**About the FLN report:**

- It is **a benchmark for states and UTs** to track their performance in achieving **universal foundational learning by 2026-27.**
- Its findings cover the role **of nutrition, access to digital technology and language-focused** instructional approach.

**It captures:**

- The **role of language in education** and highlights distinct challenges faced in a multilingual environment.
- The **fundamental concepts children require** to become skilled readers.
- **Improving the learning outcomes** using appropriate assessments and medium of instruction.

**Recommendations:**

- **Need to integrate** the medium of instruction and teaching in languages familiar to children.
- Undertake various assessments pertaining to the –
    - Linguistic system (includes phonology, vocabulary/lexicon, and syntax),
    - Orthographic system (includes symbols and mapping principles), and
    - Writing mechanisms
- Need for data monitoring along with clearly defined **outcome-based indicators on pedagogical** framework and education in India.

[**Initiatives to promote FLN:**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/11/15/editorial-analysis-where-no-child-is-left-behind/)

- [**DIKSHA or Digital Infrastructure for Knowledge Sharing**](https://diksha.gov.in/about/)**:** Launched in 2017, it is a national platform of the NCERT, where teachers can find interactive and engaging teaching material to make their classes interesting.
- [**NIPUN Bharat Mission**](https://nipunbharat.education.gov.in/)**:** Launched in 2021 for ensuring that every child in the country necessarily attains foundational literacy by the end of the third grade by the year 2026-27.
- [**NISHTHA**](https://itpd.ncert.gov.in/)**:** A new training program (in FLN) for the teachers, as well as the heads of the school launched by the NCERT.
- [**The National Curriculum Framework for Foundational Skills 2022**](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1884943)**:** To meet a key focus area of the NEP 2020, to improve the foundational skills of students.
    - Under this, ‘**jadui pitara**’ – learning and teaching material for the foundational stage of schooling, has been launched recently.

**Best practice:** Haryana Government Initiative – Saksham Haryana

### [Section 153A of the IPC: its use and misuse](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/25/section-153a-of-the-ipc-its-use-and-misuse/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:** **Functions and Responsibilities of the Union and the States**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/section-153a-its-use-and-misuse-pawan-khera-arrest-supreme-court-8465400/)

 **Context:** The SC granted interim bail to a Congress leader (Pawan Khera) arrested for alleged [hate speech](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/04/07/hate-speech/) (booked under Section 153A of the IPC) by Assam Police.

**Section 153A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC): What the law says?**

- **It penalises** (with imprisonment up to 3 years/fine/both) **promoting enmity** between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc., and **committing offences against the maintenance of peace**.
- The provision was enacted in **1898** and was not in the original penal code. In **1969**, the offence was amended (made cognisable – arrest without a warrant) to enlarge its scope to prevent communal tensions.

**The application of the law:**

- **Hate speech laws** have been invoked under different regimes **to crack down on criticism** of public functionaries and to arrest individuals.
- **For example,** a Marathi actor was arrested (booked under Section 153A of the IPC) last year, for a Facebook post allegedly defaming an NCP leader.
- According to the NCRB data, the rate of conviction for Section 153A is **very low.** In 2020, 1,804 cases were registered (six times higher than in 2014), however, the conviction rate was **2%**.
- Also, the registration of multiple FIRs across different states **drains the resources of the accused to secure legal representation.**

**Safeguards against misuse:**

- **Section 153A requires prior sanction** (before the trial begins, not at the stage of preliminary investigation) from the government for initiating prosecution.
- In the **Arnesh Kumar v State of Bihar case (2014)**, **the SC laid down a set of guidelines**. For instance, the police **cannot automatically arrest a suspect before investigation** for crimes that carry a punishment of less than seven years.
- In 2021, the SC ruled that the state will have to prove **intent** (to cause disorder or incite people to violence) for securing a conviction under Section 153A.

**Conclusion:** **Hate speech strikes at the foundational values** of society. However, the suspected unlawful speech should be evaluated using the standards of reasonableness.

### [The other victim: The environmental costs of the Russia-Ukraine War](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/25/the-other-victim-the-environmental-costs-of-the-russia-ukraine-war/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus****: Environmental Pollution**

**Source:** [**Indian Express**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/environmental-costs-russia-ukraine-war-846312/)

**Context**: The [conflict in Ukraine](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/11/editorial-analysis-lessons-from-russias-ukraine-war/) has racked up environmental costs that will far outlive the actual fighting.

[**How is the war affecting the environment**](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/toxic-legacy-ukraine-war)**?**

- **Fighting-induced destruction: N**uclear power plants and facilities, energy infrastructure, including oil storage tankers, oil refineries, drilling platforms and gas facilities and distribution pipelines, mines and industrial sites, and agro-processing facilities are getting destructed.
- **Pollution**: Air pollution and potentially serious contamination of **ground and surface waters**.
- **Deforestation**: More than 2 **million hectares of forest have been destroyed**, wrecking ecosystems and putting rare endemic species at risk.
- [**Carbon footprint**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/02/22/what-is-carbon-watch-indias-1st-app-to-assess-ones-carbon-footprint/): Ukraine estimates the emissions from Russia’s invasion to be roughly around **33 million tonnes of CO2 from the conflict and 23 million tonnes of CO2 from fires caused by the conflict.** 
- **Nuclear radiation:** Russian troops **dug up deep trenches in the protected Chornobyl sanctuary,** thereby releasing nuclear wastes and radiation.

**Solutions:**

- **Reduce military activities:** This requires the parties involved in the conflict to agree to a ceasefire and pursue diplomatic solutions to resolve their differences.
- **Restore damaged ecosystems**: This can include replanting forests, cleaning up polluted water sources, and rehabilitating habitats for wildlife.
- **Implement environmental regulations**: The private sector should also be held accountable for any environmental damage caused by their activities.
- **Promote renewable energy**: Governments should invest in renewable energy infrastructure, which will not only reduce carbon emissions but also create jobs and promote sustainable development.
- **Raise public awareness:** This can include organizing protests, writing articles and reports, and using social media to raise awareness.
- **Provide support for affected communities**: Governments and civil society organizations should provide support for these communities, including access to clean water, healthcare, and education.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, mitigating the environmental costs of the Russia-Ukraine War requires a concerted effort from all stakeholders involved. By prioritizing the environment and taking concrete actions, we can reduce the long-term impact of the conflict on the planet and its inhabitants.

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus: Environment Conservation/ Disaster Management**

**Source:** [**The Hindu**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/cop-28-must-focus-on-adaptation-instead-of-mitigation-says-environment-ministry-official/article66549569.ece#:~:text=The%20forthcoming%20United%20Nations%20Conference,heart%20of%20international%20climate%20discourse.)

[The concepts of mitigation and adaptation](https://climate.nasa.gov/solutions/adaptation-mitigation/#:~:text=Mitigation%20%E2%80%93%20reducing%20climate%20change%20%E2%80%93%20involves,these%20gases%20(such%20as%20the) are at the **heart of international climate discourse.**

[**Adaptation measures for climate change**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/climate-change-and-associated-issues/)

Adaptation refers to **adjustments in ecological, social, or economic systems** in response to actual or expected **climatic stimuli and their effects or impacts. It focuses on** assisting countries that are most vulnerable to the effects of **climate change (coastal states, island nations) with finance and infrastructural assistance**

**Reason for Focusing on the adaptation of climate Change**

- **Can help manage the risks from climate disasters such as floods and droughts**
- [**Sponge cities**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Sponge-Cities.pdf) **concept to increase storing of water** in city spaces to adapt to urban floods
- **Protection of ecosystems**
- **Protecting agriculture and food security**
- **Can allow populations to benefit from opportunities for climatic change.**

**Mitigation measures for climate change**

 Mitigation refers to actions **taken to lower the concentration of greenhouse gasses** in the atmosphere and thereby **reduce the extent to which the global climate system changes**

**Reason for Focusing on Mitigation of Climate Change**

- **To stabilize greenhouse gas levels in a sufficient time frame**
- **Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (**[**REDD+)**](https://unfccc.int/topics/land-use/workstreams/redd/what-is-redd)
- **Avoid significant human interference with the earth’s climate**
- **Enable economic development**

**Why India is pushing to focus on Adaptation:**

- **Timeframe**: Mitigation measures can take **decades to have a significant impact** but the impacts of climate change are **already being felt and will continue to worsen** in the short to medium term, making **adaptation measures more urgent.**
- **The scale of impact:** Adaptation measures can **help reduce vulnerability and minimize the negative impacts of climate change.**
- **Political will**: Adaptation measures, can **be implemented at a local level and may be more feasible to achieve.**
- **Co-benefits**: improving public health, enhancing ecosystem services, and increasing resilience to other natural disasters.

**Conclusion:**

While adaptation is important, it should not be seen as a substitute for mitigation. Both **strategies are needed to address the challenges of climate change and ensure a sustainable future for our planet**.

### **Water-Sensitive Cities Framework**

**Issues**: There is a **crisis of water supply, wastewater, and stormwater management** in urban areas, especially in the global south, due to inequity in urban settlements.

**How to make our urban areas’ water secure in a just and inclusive way?** 

- **Water conservation, groundwater recharge** and decentralised non-sewered septage treatment systems need to be prioritised in planned settlements in a city
- Cities commit to a **“Just and Equitable Access, Use, Reuse”** of water supply to sewerage/septage and stormwater management.
- **‘Design thinking’**: It assumes that cities need **more green-blue infrastructure and not grey infrastructure,** coupled with smart urban design elements.
    - Integration of **water planning and city planning**g., Building roads and drains as per hydrogeography of a place
    - Green places as **recharge areas**g., Parks, and open spaces.
    - **Reuse of adequately treated wastewater** for irrigation purposes
- **Water Sensitive Urban Design and Planning (WSUDP):** WSUDP aims at combining groundwater recharge besides several accompanying measures that reduce runoff and increase infiltration.
    - It integrates urban water cycle, water supply, wastewater, stormwater and groundwater management with spatial and urban design. 

**Usage:** This can be used as an example/Way forward in Governance questions.

### **8R Ethical guidelines for use of Traditional Knowledge**

A group of experts has **proposed a set of ethical guidelines** to guide practices on the use of traditional indigenous medicines and knowledge.

 **Current Issues**:  Cultural appropriation, traditional indigenous medicine is not widely protected by law, there is no mechanism to provide reparation and share benefits with indigenous communities, USA is not part of [CBD and ABS.](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/06/access-and-benefit-sharingabs-mechanisms/)

**8R principles:** Respectful, Reverence, Relevant, Regulation, Reparation, Reconciliation, Responsibility, Restoration

- As of 2022, only the constitutions of **Bolivia and Ecuador**include regulations specific to Indigenous traditional medicine
- **CBD’s Nagoya Protocol on Access and benefit-sharing (ABS):** It mentions indigenous rights to the use and development of their traditional medicines and related practices

**Mnemonic to remember 8R** “**R**espectful **R**everence requires **R**elevant **R**egulation, **R**eparation, and **R**econciliation with **R**esponsibility for **R**estoration.”

**Related News:**

Recently, **Eurasian Patent Organization (EAPO)** has been granted access to CSIR ‘s database on the [**Indian traditional knowledge Digital Library**](https://www.wipo.int/meetings/en/2011/wipo_tkdl_del_11/about_tkdl.html) **(TKDL).** TKDL was established in 2001.

### **Researchers grow electrodes in living tissues of zebrafish**

 **Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/world/end-of-invasive-surgery-researchers-grow-electrodes-in-living-tissues-of-zebrafish-87898#:~:text=Researchers%2C%20for%20the%20first%20time,the%20tissues%20of%20the%20organism.)

 **Context**: Researchers, for the first time, have used the body’s **own chemistry to develop electrodes in** the **tissues of zebrafish (a small freshwater fish).**

- They used the **body sugars of the fish to transform an injectable gel** into a flexible electrode while **causing no damage to the tissues of the organism.**
- The **gel is built from a mixture of chemicals and enzymes**, which are inactive. Interactions with body sugars such as **lactose and glucose induce them to become electrically conductive.**

**Possible benefits of this:**

- If successful in future tests, the **gel could one day replace conventional materials** that help restore **brain, eye, ear, spinal cord, nerve, and muscle functions**. It could also help treat **Parkinson’s disease**, **epilepsy, dystonia (a movement disorder), and depression.**
- The gel was also tested in **leeches and muscle tissues of cows**, pigs, and chickens, **showing encouraging results**.
- These findings, pave the way for **creating soft electronics in various biological tissues and environments.**

 **About Zebrafish:**

The zebrafish is a freshwater fish belonging to the minnow family of the order **Cypriniformes**. **Native** to South Asia, it is a popular aquarium fish, frequently sold under the trade name zebra danio. It is also found in private ponds.
