### [Article 105 of Constitution: The limits to free speech in Parliament, and what Supreme Court has ruled](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/13/article-105-of-constitution-the-limits-to-free-speech-in-parliament-and-what-supreme-court-has-ruled/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus:** **Parliament — Powers & Privileges and Issues Arising out of these**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/parliament-speeches-mps-article-105-8440711/)

 **Context:** Some opposition leaders are protesting the removal of parts of their speech on the [motion of thanks](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/02/09/motion-of-thanks-to-presidents-address-4/) on the President’s address during the current session of Parliament.

|**Debate on** [**Parliamentary privileges**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Parliamentary-Privileges.pdf) **– The principle found a place in the** [**GoI Act 1919**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/indian-constitution/historical-underpinnings-and-evolution/crown-rule-1858-1947/government-of-india-act-of-1919/)|   |   |
|[**Article 105**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/05/28/parliamentary-privileges-4/) **of the Indian Constitution**|**Rules of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha**|**Exception and apex court rulings**|
|●        It deals with the powers, and privileges of the Houses of Parliament (**collective**), its members (**individual**) and committees. It has the following provisions –<br><br>●        **There shall be** [**freedom of speech in Parliament**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/04/sc-verdict-on-mps-mlas-right-to-freedom-of-speech/)<br><br>●        **MPs are exempted from any legal action for any statement made or act done** in the course of their duties in Parliament.<br><br>●        This immunity extends to certain non-members as well – the **Attorney General of India** or a Minister who may not be an MP but speaks in the House.<br><br>●        This article guarantees that MPs can carry out their duties **without interruption or fear, upholds the dignity and authority of the Parliament and supports its democratic operation.**<br><br>●        Instead of the court, the **Speaker** of the House will deal with instances where a Member goes beyond the bounds of permissible free expression.|●        The two Houses have identical rules, with one exception.<br><br>●        **In RS, MPs cannot make a personal charge against a Member.**<br><br>●        The implementation of the rule book is in the hands of the **Chairman of RS and the Speaker of LS**.<br><br>●        The rules of procedure give the two presiding officers **discretion** in removing words from the recorded proceedings of the House which are “**defamatory or indecent or unparliamentary or undignified**”.<br><br>●        The LS Secretariat has brought out a volume of ‘Unparliamentary Expressions’.<br><br>●        This discretion is required because MPs have constitutional protection from legal proceedings.|●        **Exception:** In accordance with **Article 121** of the Indian Constitution, no judge’s conduct may be discussed in Parliament unless it is part of a motion that asks the President to remove the judge.<br><br>●        **SC’s rulings:**<br><br>○        Members will be allowed to take part in parliamentary debates without fear according to Article 105, which also offers the most protection against civil and criminal prosecutions.<br><br>○        But such immunity must be on their speech or vote in Parliament.|

**Concerns:**

- **A disconnect** between the speeches in the parliamentary record and the publicly available version online.
- It also means that every individual (including MPs) who shared the speech as was delivered by an MP on the floor of the House is in **breach of the privilege of Parliament.**

**Conclusion:** [The Parliament](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/parliament-and-state-legislatures/) is the “**platform to fix the accountability of the Executive**” and criticism of the government amounts neither to an allegation against an individual Member nor to an attack on the dignity of the House/s.

### [India’s urban centres are ailing due to lack of funds](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/13/indias-urban-centres-are-ailing-due-to-lack-of-funds/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus:** **Devolution of Powers and Finances up to Local Levels and Challenges Therein**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/feroze-varun-gandhi-writes-indias-urban-centres-are-ailing-due-to-lack-of-funds-8437704/) 

**Context:** To make Indian cities smarter, [the health of municipal finances](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/07/14/the-scale-of-municipal-finances-is-inadequate/) must be improved.

**Background:** The WB suggests that India will need to **invest approximately $840 billion** in [urban infrastructure](https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-economy-3/infrastructure/urban-infrastructure/) over the next 15 years.

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/central_gov.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/central_gov.png)

[**The health of municipal finances in India**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/08/municipal-mess-from-mcd-to-bmc-paralysis-of-urban-local-bodies-undermines-local-governance-and-democracy/)**:**

- Urban local bodies’ (ULBs) **own revenue is only 47%** of their total revenue and the **property tax accounts for approximately 29%** of it.
    - As per the RBI, at least **141 municipal corporations** (in FY21) saw a sharp decline in revenue (by more than 25%) or a significant increase in expenditure (by over 75%).
    - There was a decline in projected growth in **property tax.**
- **GST implementation and the pandemic** added to these revenue losses.
- **Disbursal of external grants** from the state and Centre is a concern. The CAG’s performance audit (2020) noted a saving of Rs 5,000 crore due to the non-disbursal of grants in Karnataka.

**Impact of shortfall in revenue:**

- **Cuts in essential services** – for example, sewerage services were affected.
- **Delayed salary and pension disbursements**. For example, 18,000 primary school teachers under the DMC are yet to receive their past few month’s salaries.

**Way ahead – A multi-pronged strategy to bridge the gap:**

- Many ULBs and municipal corporations need a **fiscal stimulus.**
- **Additional funding needs to be explored.** For example,
    - A revolving fund along with an overdraft facility when revenues and fiscal transfers are delayed.
    - [**Green bonds**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/02/07/green-bonds-4/) along with a joint corpus funded by the Centre and states.
- **Rationalisation of property tax.** Updating existing databases, reassessing properties using digital tools and imposing taxes on non-compliers and defaulters.
- **Concessions** (free water and electricity) will need to be rationalised.
- **Expenditure efficiency needs to be boosted** by pushing for outsourcing (for garbage services) and exploring PPP models [(hybrid annuity models](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2018/11/17/4-critically-analyze-the-hybrid-annuity-model-which-has-recently-found-favour-with-the-government-for-road-construction250-words/)) [and participatory budgeting](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/03/04/explain-the-concept-of-participatory-budgeting-also-discuss-its-relevance-in-budgeting-of-local-self-government-in-india/).
- **Performance-linked incentives.** For example, the Centre’s incentives to states to cover aspects like framing building bylaws, pushing for public transport, etc.
- **Innovative financing mechanisms** can be pursued. For example, asset monetisation, financing from carbon credit generation, etc.
- **A push for user charges** (levies like betterment, impact fees and tax increment financing should be explored) for public service delivery.
- States and the Centre must ensure that disbursements are made on time.

**Some best practices:**

- [**Municipal bonds**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2017/02/16/insights-editorial-using-municipal-bonds-bolster-city-finances/): Municipal corporations have raised over Rs 6,250 crore since 2017.
- **Tamil Nadu’s municipalities** are utilising pooled finance and aggregating funds to raise funds from the market for multiple projects.
- **Maharashtra** seeks to implement land value capture in a range of forms, with municipalities charging property owners for a specific project.
- **Gujarat** offers an interesting example in land pooling systems – any increase in land value due to public investment or civic initiatives is taxed.

**Conclusion:** Unlocking [smart cities](https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/welfare-schemes/schemes-under-ministry-of-housing-and-urban-affairs/smart-cities-mission-scm/) will require rethinking urban financing.

### [How is the government ramping up border infrastructure?](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/13/how-is-the-government-ramping-up-border-infrastructure/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus:** **Security Challenges and their Management in Border Areas**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/explained-how-is-govt-ramping-up-border-infrastructure/article66498281.ece)

**Context:** According to India’s External Affairs Minister, the government’s recent [border infrastructure](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/09/02/elaborate-on-the-components-of-border-infrastructure-examine-what-is-the-state-of-border-infrastructure-in-india/) projects focus on the north and east along India’s 3,488 km border with China (or LAC).

**Background:**

- Reports claim that **Indian forces have lost access to 26 of 65 patrolling points** [**along the LAC**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/07/08/in-bali-meeting-with-wang-jaishankar-raises-lac-issues/) **since 2020.**
- The timing is crucial because of the upcoming meetings of the [G-20](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/11/17/as-india-takes-g20-presidency-key-takeaways-from-the-summit-in-bali/) Foreign Ministers and the Foreign Ministers of [the SCO](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/09/07/shanghai-cooperation-organisation-sco/)

**About the projects:**

- **Ramping up infrastructure in Ladakh, HP, UK, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh.**
    - Many of these projects which have been in the pipeline for several decades have been expedited.
    - **For example**, the length of roads constructed in the China border areas (6,806 km between 2014 to 2022) is almost double the length constructed from 2008-2014.
- **Projects connecting India to “friendly” neighbouring states** such as Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and Myanmar.
    - Improving cross-border connectivity via highways, bridges, inland waterways, railroads, electricity lines and fuel pipelines.
    - Modernising and constructing i**ntegrated check posts** (ICPs) at all the border crossings to smooth trade.
    - **Funding and constructing infrastructure projects**. For example,
        - The [Mahakali motorable bridge](https://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2022/feb/01/bridge-over-mahakali-river-to-strengthen-relation-with-india-nepal-transport-minister-2414049.html) and the [**Maitri** Setu](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pm-modi-inaugurates-maitri-setu-between-india-and-bangladesh/article34026410.ece) between Tripura and Bangladesh,
        - The [**Kaladan** Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/03/18/kaladan-project/) (KMTTP),
        - The **Sittwe** port project and the road to Mizoram, etc.

**Need for ramping up the border infrastructure:**

- **Strategic reasons:** Successive skirmishes with the Chinese PLA in Chumar in 2014, [Doklam](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/07/07/lesson-from-doklam-no-de-escalation-until-full-return-of-status-quo/) in 2017, and the [Galwan clashes in 2020](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/06/18/india-china-galwan-valley-standoff/).
- **Border preparedness:** To update the quality of structures, the technology involved and their maintenance.

#### **GS Paper 4**

**Source**: [TH](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/justice-nazeer-started-his-lifes-journey-in-tough-circumstances-in-karnataka/article66501103.ece), [IE](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/tribal-affairs-minister-meets-domestic-help-tortured-by-gurgaon-employers-shocked-at-brutality-she-suffered-8441112/#:~:text=Union%20Minister%20for%20Tribal%20Affairs%20Arjun%20Munda%20Sunday%20met%20the,her%20employers%20had%20tortured%20her.), [IE](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/shashikant-warishe-murdered-8439206/)

**Example 1: Justice S. Abdul Nazeer**

**Context**: He is a retired Supreme Court judge who recently became the Governor of Andhra Pradesh. 

**Ethical learnings from his life:**

- **Hard work and determination**: He started his life in difficult circumstances, even scavenging for fish to supplement his family’s income.
    - He went on to become a successful lawyer and judge, demonstrating the importance of **hard work and determination.**
- **Perseverance**: He compared it to the **“duck syndrome**,” with him paddling hard under the water to keep himself afloat.
- **Respect for elders and sacrifices of parents**: Justice Nazeer has spoken about the sacrifices of his mother for the family and has shown respect for his elders.
- **Openness to diversity and inclusive mindset**: Justice Nazeer has learned Sanskrit, demonstrates a diversity of interests and has an open mind.
    - This teaches us the **importance of being open to different cultures, traditions** and perspectives.
- **Ethical decision-making**: As a judge, Justice Nazeer stood for what is right and placed the nation first.

**Ethical Issues with his appointment as Governor (after he retired from being SC judge)**:

- Potential to raise questions about the [**independence of the judiciary**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/07/23/independence-of-the-judiciary/#:~:text=The%20judicial%20independence%20ensures%20public%20confidence%20as%20an,of%20any%20kind%20of%20misconduct%20by%20the%20executive.) and the [**separation of powers**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/separation-of-powers-between-various-organs-dispute-redressal-mechanisms-and-institutions/separation-of-powers-between-various-organs/) between the branches of government
- It undermines the **impartiality** of the judiciary and **erodes the public’s trust** in the justice system.
- Gives an image of **the quid pro quo** between executive and judiciary

**Counterview**: However, It is important to note that the appointment of judges as governors is not uncommon in India and in many other countries. In such cases, the individual must maintain their **impartiality and avoid any actions** that could be perceived as compromising the independence of the judiciary. 

**Example 2:** Recently a Gurgaon couple have been arrested for brutally torturing their 17-year-old domestic help.

- Union Minister of Tribal Affairs has said _“**Such barbaric acts in a civilised society are not only unfortunate but also a question of humanity**”._ 

**Ethical issues concerned in the case:**

- **Human Rights Violation**: The minor girl was subjected to torture, physical abuse, and exploitation by her employers.
- **Child Abuse**
- **Failure of the System**: The minor girl was rescued only after someone tipped off the authorities
- **Discrimination based on Caste and Tribe:** The girl is from a Scheduled Tribe.
- **Inadequate Support** and Protection Mechanisms

**Example 3: Journalist Shashikant Warishe**

**Shashikant Warishe,** a 48-year-old journalist from the Rajapur area of Ratnagiri district in Maharashtra, died after being mowed down by a person against whom Warishe had written an article.

**Ethical issues related to the case:**

- [**Freedom of speech and expression**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/07/editorial-analysis-the-freedom-of-speech-and-an-adolescent-india/): The journalist Shashikant Warishe was killed because of the articles he wrote (being critical of the government’s proposed Ratnagiri refinery project).
- **Violence against journalists**
- **Environmental concerns:** Warishe was covering the issues about pollution and land acquisition from the proposed refinery, which highlights the importance of responsible reporting on environmental issues.
- **Human rights violations**
- **Responsibility of the government**: It is the government’s responsibility to ensure the **safety of journalists** and to hold those who violate their rights accountable.

**Source**: [ET](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/india-running-on-tracks-of-heritage-development-pm-modi/articleshow/97837851.cms)

**Context**: PM inaugurated celebrations commemorating the **200th birth anniversary of social reformer and Arya Samaj founder** [**Dayanand Saraswati**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/modern-indian-history/socio-religious-reform-movements-in-the-19th-and-20th-ce-india/hindu-reform-movements/)

**Other notable contributions:**

- **Book**: Satyarth Prakash (Text on the philosophy of the Vedas)
- He was the **first to give the call for Swaraj as “India for Indians” in 1876**, a call later taken up by Lokmanya Tilak.
- Subsequently, former President of India, S. Radhakrishnan, called him one of the **“makers of Modern India”,** as did Sri Aurobindo.

**Impact**: These contributions have had a lasting impact on Indian society and continue to be relevant even today.

In recent times, the government has been committed to celebrating social reformers and important personalities. E.g.

- The government declared the **birth anniversary of Birsa Muda as the Janjatiya Gaurav Diwas.**
- **The National Unity Day or Rashtriya Ekta Diwas** is celebrated every year on **October 31**to commemorate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.

 **Reasons cited by the SC**:

[Judicial Review](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/01/06/judicial-review/) of the [Collegium](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/05/10/what-is-the-collegium-system-and-how-it-works/) decision **violates the law as declared**, as it would amount to **evaluating and substituting** the decision of the Collegium, with an **individual or personal opinion** on the suitability and merits of the person

**About JR:**

Judicial review in India refers to the **power of the Indian courts (SC or HC)** to review and **potentially invalidate laws** and governmental actions that conflict with the Constitution of India.

- The power of judicial review in India is derived from the **principle of the rule of law** and the **idea that the Constitution** is the supreme law of the land.
- In India, the **power of judicial review** is exercised through **writ petitions**
- **Article 13** expressively provides for the doctrine of JR
