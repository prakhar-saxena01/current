### [Why Turkey is prone to devastating earthquakes?](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/07/why-turkey-is-prone-to-devastating-earthquakes/)

#### **GS1/GS3**

**Syllabus****: Disaster Management**

**Source:** [**The Hindu**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/explained-why-turkey-is-prone-to-devastating-earthquakes/article66476957.ece#:~:text=Turkey's%20proneness%20to%20earthquakes%20comes,between%20two%20blocks%20of%20rocks.)**,** [**Indian Express**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/turkey-earthquake-measure-magnitude-explained-8426883/)

 **Context**: Three [earthquake](https://www.insightsonindia.com/world-geography/physical-geography-of-the-world/geomorphology/internal-forces-their-impact/earthquakes/)s measuring — **7.8, 7.6, and 6.0** — magnitude on the **Richter scale have devastated Turkey and Syria,** while impacting regions as far away as Cyprus, Lebanon, Israel, and Egypt.

**Turkey** has announced a **Level 4 alert calling for international aid**; U.S., European Union, Russia, and Azerbaijan have reportedly dispatched aid.

 **Why is Turkey prone to** [**Earthquakes**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/world-geography/physical-geography-of-the-world/geomorphology/internal-forces-their-impact/earthquakes/)**?**

- In the region of **Turkey, Syria, and Jordan**, [tectonics](https://www.insightsonindia.com/world-geography/physical-geography-of-the-world/geomorphology/first-order/) are dominated by complex interactions between the **African, Arabian, and Eurasian tectonic plates, and the Anatolian tectonic block.**
- **Other factors:**
    - **Red Sea Rift**, the spreading centre between the African and Arabian plates;
    - **Dead Sea Transform**, a major strike-slip fault that also accommodates Africa-Arabia relative motions;
    - **North Anatolia Fault**, a right-lateral strike-slip structure in northern Turkey accommodating much of the translational motion of the Anatolia block westwards with respect to Eurasia and Africa;
    - **Cyprian Arc,** a convergent boundary between the African plate and the Anatolia block.

**What are aftershocks and why do they occur?**

- Aftershocks are a **sequence of earthquakes that happen after a larger main shock on a fault**. They occur near the fault zone where the main shock rupture occurred and are part of the “readjustment process” after the main slip on the fault.
- While they become less frequent with time, they can continue for days, weeks, months, or even years for a very large main shock.

### [Decoding India’s population conundrum](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/07/decoding-indias-population-conundrum/)

#### **GS Paper 1**

**Syllabus:** **Population and Associated Issues**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/podcast/decoding-indias-population-conundrum-in-focus-podcast/article66477216.ece)

 **Direction:**  This is from ‘The Hindu Podcast’, it discusses the advantages and disadvantages of India becoming the world’s most populous nation in 2023.

**Context:** 2023 is set to be a landmark year for India’s [population](https://www.insightsonindia.com/society/population-and-associated-issues/) trajectory, as the country is predicted to overtake China to become the world’s most populous nation.

**Background:**

- According to the **UN World Population Prospects 2022**, India is projected to **overtake China** as the world’s most populous country in
- India’s population stands at **412 billion in 2022** and is projected to have a population of 1.668 billion in 2050.
- India is expected to reach **1,428.6 million in 2023**. On the other hand, China’s population fell to 1,411.8 million in 2022 (from 1,412.6 million in 2021).

**Implications for India:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Positive**|**Negative**|
|●        India will continue to have **one of the world’s youngest populations** until 2030.<br><br>●        Currently, in a demographic window of opportunity – a “**youth bulge**,” that will last until 2025 (median age in India – 28.7 years, 38.4 – in China, 48.6 – in Japan).<br><br>●        Thus, prospects to [reap the **demographic dividend**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/01/19/mission-2022-mindmap-reaping-indias-demographic-dividend/) – share of the working-age population will peak at 57% towards the mid-2030s.<br><br>●        More working-age population → more tax revenues → savings potential will increase → high growth rate.<br><br>●        A relatively lower number of those needing care such as the elderly and young children.|●        **Lack of policies** for education, skilling and health in place.<br><br>●        **Vast underemployment** among educated youths.<br><br>●        In the absence of meaningful opportunities for the youth, the demographic dividend → **demographic nightmare.**<br><br>●        **Uneven population growth**. **For example**, some Southern states have populations that age faster than some northern States.|

**Way ahead:**

- India must shift its lens from ‘population control’ to **‘**[**population development**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/08/14/editorial-analysismoving-policy-away-from-population-control/)**’.**
- For this, India must frame policies and strategies to effectively unleash the full potential of its young people.

**Conclusion:** India is not fully utilizing its [**demographic dividend**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Reaping-Indias-demographic-dividend.pdf)**,** which refers to the economic advantage of having a large working-age population. To fully reap the benefits, India must create high-quality jobs and equip its young, skilled workforce to fill them.

### [NCST functioning with less than 50% of sanctioned strength](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/07/ncst-functioning-with-less-than-50-of-sanctioned-strength/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: Constitutional and Statutory bodies**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ncst-functioning-with-less-than-50-of-sanctioned-strength-ministry-in-ls/article66478216.ece)**,** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tribal-affairs-ministry-evades-question-on-pending-st-status-requests/article66477905.ece)

**Context:** Data from the Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MoTA) revealed that the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST) is currently functioning with **less than 50% of its sanctioned strength**

**Issues with the staffing in the commission:**

- **The sanctioned strength of the ST panel is** one Chairperson+ one Vice-Chairperson+ three Members= **total of Five members** (two among V-C and Members must be from the ST community and one member must be a woman).
    - However, currently, it just has a **Chairperson** (Harsh Chouhan) and **one Member** (Ananta Nayak) with all other positions, including that of the mandatory ST Member, vacant for the **last three years**
- **Posts under Group A, B and C:** Against total sanctioned posts of 124; 70 posts are vacant
    - **Among the group A posts:** Sanctioned posts of one Superintendent of Police, one Law Officer and one Accounts Officer are vacant since 2004.
        - **While Group A posts in the NCST** are filled by the Ministry, Groups B and C posts are the NCST’s responsibility
    - **The recruitment rules** for the posts are yet to be framed
- **Posts of Research Officers**, Investigators and Directors are vacant
- **Lack of applicants**: The Ministry claimed that the **eligibility bar** was set too high for the entry of applicants

**Other concerns:**

- **Fewer meetings:** In the financial year 2021-22, it has met only four times.
- **High rate of pendency of cases**: Its rate of pendency of resolution of complaints and cases that it receives is also close to 50%

**About NCST:**

NCST is a constitutional body set up by amending **Article 338** and by inserting a new article 338A in the Constitution (89th Constitution Amendment Act, 2003) in 2004.

Erstwhile **National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes** was replaced by **two separate Commissions namely:**

- The National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC)
- The National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST)

Schedule tribes are termed “backward tribes” living in the “Excluded” and “Partially Excluded” areas (as per Census-1931).

- **Article 366**of the Constitution only provides a **process to define Scheduled Tribes**: Tribal communities as are deemed under **Article 342**
- **342(1):** The President may specify the tribe as Scheduled Tribe in relation to that State or Union Territory.
- **Among the 700 tribes notified**, the largest number of tribal communities (62) are found in **Odisha** and no Tribe was identified in **Haryana, Punjab, Chandigarh, Delhi, and Pondicherry.**

**Few Related Committees**

- **Lokur Committee (1965): It** set the criteria for defining Schedule Tribes
- **Bhuria Commission (2002-2004):** It focused on issues such as the 5th Schedule to tribal land, forests, health and education, the working of Panchayats and the status of tribal women.

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus:** **Health and related issues**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/thiruvananthapuram/kerala-has-a-drug-problem-300-jump-in-cases-over-six-years-arrests-increase-90-8426013/#:~:text=Data%20show%20that%20the%20police,of%202019%20(9%2C245%20cases).)

 **Direction:** The article highlights the drug menace in India, its impact and steps taken by the government of India.

**Context:** In 2022, Kerala saw a high increase in cases involving drugs, liquor, and prohibited tobacco items, suggesting that drugs have become a new problem for the state.

**Background:**

- Data show that the police registered 26,629 cases under the [Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/12/07/ndps-bill-2021/) in 2022 – **a jump of over 300%** when compared to 2016.
- While there was a fall in the quantity of ganja seized in 2022 over the previous year, seizures of **heroin, charas and hashish** have gone up.
- **Bengaluru and Goa remain** major hubs from where the drugs are sourced and **cannabis** is the main drug used by teenagers.
- The steady rise in drug-related cases in Kerala is **a factor of both strict enforcement and raids and easier access to contraband**.
- Youngsters are now aware of the availability of synthetic/recreational drugs (MDMA and LSD). There is also **peer pressure** to explore these drugs.

**Scale of the Drug Addiction problem in India:**

- The UNODC’s **World Drug Report 2022** estimates that around **284 million people use drugs worldwide**.
- The report also claims **India is one of the world’s single-largest opiate markets** and most addicts are between the **age group of 15 and 35** and many are **unemployed**.
- **More than 60%** of all illicit drugs seized in India are from **Punjab**.

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/heroin.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/heroin.png)**

**Impact on individual, economy, society and national security:**

- Drug addiction poses a **high risk of unintentional injuries, accidents, domestic violence incidents**, medical problems and death.
- **Impacts on Mental Health:** Drug dependence leads to low self-esteem, and hopelessness and can lead to **criminal activities**/law and order challenges and even **suicidal tendencies**.
- Drug abusers’ **economic potential gets severely impacted**. **For example**, they fail to become part of the workforce.
- **Money earned from the illegal drug trade** is used to aid terrorist organisations, which **threatens the defence and security** of many countries.

**Measures taken by the government:**

- **The NDPS Act, 1985**: Under the act, the **Narcotics Control Bureau** (NCB) was constituted in 1986 with the prime responsibility of **fighting drug trafficking and drug abuse**.
- [**Nasha Mukt Bharat Abhiyaan (NMBA)**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/06/29/nasha-mukt-bharat-annual-action-plan-2020-21/)**:** In 2020, the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment launched NMBA in 272 most vulnerable districts of India to address the problem.
- The MoSJ&E has begun the implementation of a [National Action Plan for Drug Demand Reduction](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/01/17/national-action-plan-for-drug-demand-reduction-2018-2023/) (**NAPDDR**) for 2018-2025.
- The government constituted the Narco-Coordination Centre (**NCORD**) in 2016.
- The government has constituted a fund called the “[**National Fund for Control of Drug Abuse**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/10/25/national-fund-to-control-drug-abuse/)” to meet the expenditure incurred in combating illicit traffic in Narcotic Drugs, rehabilitating addicts, educating the public against drug abuse, etc.

**Best Practice:** 

**The Portuguese model:**

- In 2001, **Portugal became the first country in the world** to decriminalise the possession and use of all illegal drugs.
- Instead of sending people to court for drug possession, its model focuses on **education, treatment and harm reduction.**

**Operation “Gear Box”** was started by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) to combat the smuggling of heroin by detecting the hidden drugs in the gearboxes.

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus:** **Conservation, environmental pollution and degradation**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/water/long-term-groundwater-storage-in-ganga-basin-declining-at-2-6-cm-per-year-study-87492)

 **Direction:** The article highlights that groundwater in the Ganga basin has been declining. The article includes a best practice (infographics) of groundwater conservation in India.

**Context:**

- According to new estimates, [groundwater](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/04/06/insights-into-editorial-making-groundwater-visible/) storage levels have been **declining by 2.6 centimetres per year** in the Ganga basin.
- The impacts were more pronounced in **Rajasthan, Haryana and Delhi**, with average storage declines of roughly 14 cm/year, 1, 7.5 cm/year and 7.2 cm year−1, respectively.

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ganga.jpg?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ganga.jpg)**

**Background:**

- A recent **Central Groundwater Board yearbook**, which monitors groundwater levels four times a year, found that the water levels in 2021-2022 rose compared to the 2011-2020 average.
- **The Brahmaputra basin**, which was not a part of the study, shows more groundwater level reduction than the Ganga and Indus basins.

**Findings of the study:**

- The Ganga Basin’s **aquifers are one of the largest reservoirs of groundwater** in the world.
- Researchers **used three different methods** to study long-term groundwater storage across six states.
    - Data between 1996 and 2017 from the **Central Groundwater Board.**
    - Data from the **Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE)** – satellites launched in 2002 to assess Earth’s water reservoirs over land, ice and ocean.
    - A model to study **groundwater dynamics and storage**
- All three analyses depicted that groundwater in the Ganga basin is declining. The new study included western **Delhi, Haryana and Rajasthan under the Ganga basin.**
- **Rajasthan**, whose groundwater reserves contribute about 90% of the drinking water and 60% of the irrigation, **is showing an improvement in groundwater levels in the recent past.**

**Impacted Regions:**

- **Agriculturally intensive regions and urban areas** (like Delhi and Agra) took the biggest hit.
- **Delhi and Haryana** have high groundwater abstraction rates (**Groundwater abstraction** refers to the process of removing water from underground aquifers for various purposes such as irrigation, drinking water supply, industrial use, or for recharging depleted aquifers.)

**Reasons highlighted by the WMO’s – first State of Global Water Resources 2021:**

- **The worsening impact of climate change/global warming** – more water flowing in the river channels due to glacial melt, however, **total water storage declined in 2021.**
- **Over-abstraction** of groundwater for irrigation.

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/explained-voice-deepfakes-how-are-they-are-used/article66476423.ece#:~:text=A%20voice%20deepfake%20is%20one,voice%20clones%20or%20synthetic%20voices.)

**Context:**  Recently several users of **ElevenLabs** (“speech synthesis” and “voice cloning” service provider) made voice deepfakes of celebrities like Emma Watson, Joe Rogan, and Ben Shapiro.

- Those deepfake audios made **racist, abusive, and violent comments** without consent.

  **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/voice-1-1024x1024.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/voice-1.png)**

**Ethical concerns related to the use of voice deepfakes**:

- **Deception**: Using false or misleading audio recordings
- **Privacy invasion:** Making deepfake voices to impersonate others without their consent
- **Damage to reputation and credibility**
- **Lack of regulation**: Currently no law regulates it
- **Impact on public trust**: It may lead to **misinformation**.
- **Discriminatory uses**: It can be used to create fake recordings of marginalized communities, amplifying **harmful stereotypes and perpetuating discrimination**.

**Other Concerns:**

- **Cases of defrauding users:**g. In 2020, a manager from a bank in the U.A.E., received a phone call from someone he believed was a company director to transfer **$35 million**.
- **Identity Theft:** **Morgan Neville’s documentary film** on the well-known late chef Anthony Bourdain used voice-cloning software to make Bourdain say words he never spoke. This sparked criticism.
- **Phone scams**
- **Posting fake videos on social media platforms**: To blackmail the target

### **Prison Reforms**

 **Source:** [**Th**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/punish-to-reform-rajasthans-open-prison-model/article66471142.ece#:~:text=The%20open%20prison%20model%20adopted,with%2040%20such%20open%20camps.) 

**Rajasthan Model of Open Prison**: The open prison model adopted in Rajasthan, with convicts staying on community land without high walls or strict surveillance, has promoted a **reformative form of punishment** and succeeded in transforming the lives of inmates.

**Benefits:**

- **Reformative form of punishment:** It is premised on the humane concept that a wrongdoer does not simply cease to be a living human being just because he commits crimes. In contrast, Retributive justice focuses on punishing an offender
- **Lower expenses**: As minimum security facilities, the open prisons need 92% less staff than closed jails, and incur monthly costs of only ₹500 per prisoner; no reports of prisoner escapes or repeat offences
- Rajasthan has now proved the concept with **40 such open camps**.

Overall, open prisons can offer a **more ethical approach to imprisonment** by promoting rehabilitation, reducing overcrowding, improving human rights, and potentially reducing costs.

**Usage**: These examples can be used as an example of [prison reforms](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Prison-Reforms-in-India.pdf)/way forward in Ethics/Governance/Internal Security Questions

### **PM rolls out 20% ethanol-blended petrol in 11 States/UTs**

 **Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pm-modi-rolls-out-20-ethanol-blended-petrol-in-11-statesuts/article66476921.ece)

 **Context:** Petrol blended with 20% ethanol was rolled out at select petrol pumps in 11 states and UTs as part of a programme to increase the use of [biofuels](https://www.insightsonindia.com/science-technology/biotechnology/biofuels/) to cut emissions as well as dependence on foreign exchange-draining imports.

**Background:**

- **At present, 10% ethanol** is blended in petrol (10% ethanol, 90% petrol) and the government is looking to **double this quantity by 2025** (advanced by 5 years).
- Ethanol blending in petrol increased from **5%** (in 2014) to 10% and is now progressing towards 20% blending.
- The PM launched the higher 20% [ethanol-blended petrol](https://www.insightsonindia.com/science-technology/biotechnology/ethanol-blending-programme-in-india/) (E20) at the **India Energy Week (IEW) 2023**, two months ahead of the planned rollout.

**Significance of rolling out E20:**

- India currently is **85%** (the world’s third-largest oil consumer and importer) **dependent on imports** for meeting its oil needs.
- The use of ethanol will **cut its imports and save forex.** India spent USD 120.7 billion on the import of crude oil in the 2021-22 fiscal. In the current fiscal, USD 125 billion have been spent in the first nine months (April to December) alone.
- The use of ethanol, extracted from sugarcane as well as broken rice and other agri produce, will also be a boost to
- **Also, it cuts carbon emissions.** Estimated reduction of CO emissions by about 50% in 2-wheelers and about 30% in 4-wheelers compared to E0.
