#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: Government Policies and Interventions**

**Source:** [**WFP: HungerMap**](https://static.hungermapdata.org/insight-reports/latest/global-summary.pdf)

 **Context:** The [World Food Programme](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/15/world-food-programme-5/#:~:text=The%20World%20Food%20Programme%20is,leading%20provider%20of%20school%20meals.) has released “HungerMap LIVE: **Global insights and key trends”.**

**What is HungerMap LIVE?**

HungerMap LIVE is a **real-time monitoring system tracking key indicators** of acute hunger, including household food consumption, livelihoods, child nutritional status, mortality, and access to clean water.

**The trend:**

The **global issue of** [**hunger and food insecurity**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/14/the-state-of-food-security-and-nutrition-in-the-world-2023/) has shown an **alarming increase since 2015**, a trend exacerbated by a combination of factors including the **pandemic, conflict, climate change, and deepening inequalities,** which calls for attention.

 **Context:** The article (by Shashi Tharoor) discusses the **need for improving** [**parliamentary conduct in India’s Parliament**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/08/10/code-of-conduct-for-mps-and-mlas/) and suggests emulating certain practices from the Houses of Westminster to address the issue of frequent disruptions.

Recently, **Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury (LS), Sanjay Singh and Raghav Chadha** (in Rajya Sabha) were suspended for disrupting the parliament.

**Evolution of** [**Indian Parliament**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/29/indias-new-parliament-need-and-significance/)**:**

Initially, India’s parliamentary system was **modeled after Britain’s Westminster model**, and Indian MPs followed British parliamentary traditions with pride and authenticity.

|**Credibility Concerns**|**Disruptive conduct** may have discredited Parliament in the eyes of the public, impacting its credibility.|**Rebuild public trust** through transparency, accountability, and adherence to parliamentary rules.|

|While disruptions are tolerated to allow Opposition space, standards of behaviour have been compromised.|**Opposition Day:** Allowing the Opposition a designated day a week to set the agenda for debate.|
|**Speaker’s Role**|The **Speaker’s rejection of adjournment** motions, amendments, and division votes hinders Opposition representation.|Ensure **impartiality in the Speaker’s decisions** and allow for robust debates.|

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/why-is-google-on-trial-in-the-united-states-explained/article67316168.ece)

 **Context: Google is currently facing allegations in a U.S. court** that it used **illegal tactics to maintain a monopoly in online search**.

- The **S. Department of Justice (DoJ)** and **several U.S. states argue that Google’s “arrangements” with companies like Apple** to be the **default search engine** on their devices constitute **unlawful monopoly building**.
- Google contends that its **success is due to providing superior services rather than stifling competition.**

This case is significant not only for Google but also for other **major internet companies like Amazon and Meta,** as it could set a precedent **for how antitrust issues are addressed in the tech industry.**

While the **European Union has previously fined Google for antitrust violations**, this case represents a growing **“techlash” in the U.S**. against the **influence and practices of big tech companies**.

**“**[**Anti-trust” issues**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/09/03/apple-faces-antitrust-case-in-india-over-apps-issue/)**,** refer to **concerns related to antitrust laws and regulations**, which are designed to **promote fair competition and prevent anti-competitive practices** in the marketplace.

### [Water on the Moon](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/09/18/water-on-the-moon-2/)

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/earth-electrons-moon-water-chandrayaan-1-8941026/)

**Context:** A recent study **using data from the** [**Chandrayaan-1 mission**](https://www.isro.gov.in/Chandrayaan_1.html) has suggested that **high-energy electrons in Earth’s magnetosphere** might be contributing to the **formation of water on the Moon’s surface.**

- The research indicates that **electrons in our planet’s plasma sheet**, a region of trapped charged particles within Earth’s magnetosphere, **may play a role in weathering processes on the lunar surface,** potentially leading to the formation of water.
- The study builds **upon previous research that showed oxygen in Earth’s “magnetotail**” is causing **rusting on iron in the lunar polar region**.

The analysis of remote sensing data collected by **the Moon Mineralogy Mapper** during the Chandrayaan-1 mission revealed that **water formation in the magnetotail appeared to be consistent whether the Moon was inside or outside of it.** This suggests the presence of water formation processes or sources not directly associated with solar wind protons.

**Source:** [**The Wire**](https://thewire.in/health/india-australia-nipah-virus)

 **Context:** India is seeking **Australia’s assistance in combating the Nipah virus** outbreak, which has **claimed 12 lives in the country.**

- The **Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR)** has reached out to the **Queensland government in Australia** to obtain an **antibody developed there for testing its effectiveness in neutralizing the Nipah virus in humans.**
- While the antibody has **shown promise in vitro (outside the body in artificial conditions**), it has not **been tested on humans**.
- The move aims to generate data on the **efficacy of the antibody against the virus, which has a high mortality rate of 50 to 70%.**

Currently, there is **no specific vaccine or treatment for Nipah virus infection**, and the treatment for **human cases primarily involves supportive care**.

 **Context:** A **Supreme Court-appointed committee** has declared **12 private resorts** along the **Segur elephant corridor illegal.**

- This corridor is **vital for the movement of elephants and other wildlife between habitats** in the **Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve**.
- The resorts were challenged by the owners who claimed the corridor didn’t comprise an elephant habitat. The **committee ruled in favour of protecting the corridor**, noting that the resorts had erected **illegal structures that hindered elephant movement**.
- While this decision safeguards the corridor, it has economic consequences for local communities reliant on resort employment.

**Context: The Munnar Wildlife Division in Idukki**, India, has **successfully transformed the Pazhathottam area in the Anamudi Shola National Park** from a **burnt-out land filled with exotic tree species into a lush 50-hectare forest.**

- This **eco-restoration project** carried out with support from **the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)**, **removed exotic species and planted natural grass, revitalizing the area.**

As a result, **wildlife like bison and wild elephants have returned**, and bird species like the **Nigiri Pipit are now regular visitors**. The project also revived natural streams, **ensuring water security downstream.**

An eco-development committee named **“Haritha Vasantham”** was formed for the project, involving local residents in its implementation.

In 2023, record-high temperatures have been observed globally. Scientists attribute this unusual heat to various factors, **including an underwater** [**volcanic eruption off Tonga**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/11/21/mission-2023-insights-daily-current-affairs-pib-summary-21-november-2022/tonga-volcanic/) **(**Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai**) in the South Pacific in January 2022**.

The volcano is located in the **Tonga island of the South Pacific Ocean**. It is part of the **Tonga–Kermadec Islands volcanic arc** formed due to the subduction of the **Pacific Plate under the Indo-Australian Plate.**
