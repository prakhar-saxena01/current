#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: Bilateral Relations**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/khalistan-shadow-on-india-canada-ties-8947270/)

 **Context:** Current tensions between [India and Canada](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/17/india-canada-relationship/) escalated when Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused India of involvement in the **killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar,** designated as a terrorist by India. India rejected the allegations and accused Canada of sheltering **Khalistani extremists**.

**Who are** [**Khalistani**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/25/a-brief-history-of-the-khalistan-movement/#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20Khalistan%20movement,subsequent%20Partition%20along%20religious%20lines.) **Extremist?** 

The Khalistan extremist movement is a separatist movement that seeks to establish an independent Sikh state called Khalistan. It emerged primarily among the Sikh diaspora, particularly in countries like Canada, during the 1980s and has been associated with violence and acts of terrorism.

**Khalistan Movement History:** 

The Khalistan movement has roots in Canada, with the establishment of a **‘Khalistan government in exile’** office in **Vancouver in 1982**. The movement gained momentum after [**Operation Bluestar**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/tag/operation-blue-star/) **in 1984**.

**Rift in relations between India and Canada:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Aspect**|**Explanation**|
|**Historical Background**|The strained relationship **dates back to 1948 when Canada supported a plebiscite in Kashmir.** In 1998, **Canada recalled its high commissioner** to India after India conducted nuclear tests.|
|**Sikh extremism**|Presence of **Sikh separatist groups** in Canada E.g., In 2022, India objected to Canada permitting a Khalistani secessionist “**referendum**”|
|Concerns about the revival of the **Khalistan movement** E.g., a recent incident where **a pro-Khalistani parade** in Canada featured a tableau depicting India’s former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and her assassins|
|**Sikh Diaspora’s Influence on Canadian Politics** e.g., Canadian PM Justin Trudeau relied on the New Democratic Party (NDP) for his government’s survival, and NDP leader Jagmeet Singh is a vocal supporter of Khalistan|
|**Changing Reports**|Canada’s **annual report on the terrorist threat initially** mentioned Sikh extremism and Khalistan in 2018 but later removed these references. This action was criticized by **Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh**.|
|**Canada’s interference**|Canadian comments over **India’s farmer protests and India’s cancellation** of diplomatic talks in response.|
|**Recent Tensions**|Tensions have escalated over the last few years, especially since Justin Trudeau became **Canada’s Prime Minister in 2015.**|
|**Allegations of Inaction**|India has accused the **Canadian government of inaction against pro-Khalistan supporters,** which it views as an attempt to gain favour with the Canadian-Sikh community. Canada has denied these allegations.|
|In **February-March 2023,** India protested against attacks on its diplomatic missions in Canada.|
|||
|**Impact on Immigration**|The ongoing tensions have led to a **significant increase in asylum claims** by Indian nationals, primarily Punjabis, in Canada.|
|**Impediments for Trade**|India’s Complex labour laws; Market protectionism; Bureaucratic regulations|
|No progress has been made in bilateral agreements such as the **Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) and Investment Promotion and Protection Agreements (BIPPA)**|

**Canada’s Perspective:** Canadian officials argue that the **Khalistan separatist movement** is relatively insignificant and that the referendums organized by Sikh for Justice are within the **bounds of the law**.

**Other Aspects of India- Canada Bilateral Relations:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Relations**|**Examples and Initiatives**|
|**Diplomatic**|India established diplomatic **relations with Canada in 1947.** Prime Minister of India’s visit to Canada in April 2015 elevated the bilateral relationship to a **strategic partnership**.|

#### **Content for Mains Enrichment**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/women-representation-parliament-democracies-8946800/)

 **Context:** Rwanda has a high representation of women in its [Parliament](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/09/14/parliaments-75-year-journey/), **with around 61 per cent of Lower House seats occupied** by women.

**Why does** [**Rwanda**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/30/rwanda-policy/rwanda-4/) **have so many women parliamentarians?**

This is due to historical factors, including the **aftermath of the Rwandan genocide in 1994**, which left a majority of the population composed of women. To address this, Rwanda implemented **gender equality initiatives**, including a **30 per cent quota for women** in decision-making organs, such as Parliament.

While this has led to progress in political representation and laws on issues like education and gender-based violence, challenges remain, including access to **education and traditional gender roles**.

**Additional Information:** 

**Percentage of women in the Lower house of major democracies:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Country**|**Percentage**|
|**India**|78 elected women MPs out of a total of 543 seats, representing **14.36%** of the total number of MPs.|
