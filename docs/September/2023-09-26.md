**What are** [**Patents**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/science-technology/intellectual-property-and-issues/various-subject-matters-of-intellectual-property-in-india/patents/#:~:text=The%20fundamental%20principle%20of%20Patent,the%20date%20of%20the%20patent.)**?** 

Patents are **government-issued exclusive rights that grant inventors or assignees** the sole authority to utilize, make, sell, or license their invention for a limited period, **typically 20 years**.

- Patents are granted for **new and useful inventions** and are intended to encourage innovation by providing **legal protection and exclusive rights** to inventors.
- **Granted by:** Controller General of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks (**CGPDTM**) under the DPIIT (Ministry of Commerce & Industry)
- Patents in India are governed by “[**The Patent Act 1970**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/tag/indian-patent-act-1970/)**,**” which was amended in 2005 to comply with **TRIPS** (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights).

**Criteria for issuing patents in India include:**

- **Novelty**: The invention must be new and not previously published or publicly known or used in India.
- **Non-Obviousness**: It should involve an inventive step, representing a technical advancement compared to existing knowledge, and not obvious to a person skilled in the relevant field.
- **Industrial Use:** The invention should be capable of industrial application.

**What Cannot Be Patented in India:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Items**|**Description**|
|**Frivolous Inventions**|Inventions that harm public order, morality, or the health of animals, plants, and humans.|
|**Methods of Agriculture or Horticulture**|Generally excluded from patentability.|
|**Traditional Knowledge**|Inventions based solely on traditional knowledge are not eligible for patents.|
|**Computer Programs**|Pure computer programs are typically not patentable.|
|**Inventions Related to Atomic Energy**|Matters related to atomic energy are restricted from patenting.|
|**Plants and Animals**|Typically, plants and animals in their natural state cannot be patented.|
|**Mere Discovery of Scientific Principles**|Patent protection is not granted for mere discoveries of scientific principles.|

**Key Provisions of the Draft Patent Amendment Rules:**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Key Provisions**|**Description**|**Impact of the changes**|
|**Pre-Grant Opposition (PGO) filing**|**Fee: There will be a variable** fee for Pre-Grant Opposition (PGO) filing (previously free).|The introduction of dynamic fees for PGO filing may **pose financial challenges** for smaller groups or individuals interested in opposing patents.|
|PGO is a **pre-grant opposition** filed after patent publication but before its grant.|**PGO allows for opposition before patent grants,** helping prevent unjust patent protection extensions and promoting access to affordable generic drugs.|
|PGO filing, previously open to anyone, will now be determined by **CGPDTM**.|Determining PGO filing by CGPDTM **may bring more structure** to the opposition process.|
|**Notice Time Period**|The time period for applicants to reply to notice on PGO has been reduced to **2 months**.|Reducing the time period for applicants to reply to PGO notices to 2 months **may affect the ability to prepare and submit responses effectively**|
|**Timeline for Filing Requests for Examination**|The timeline for filing Requests for Examination is reduced from 48 to 31 months.|Reducing the timeline for filing **Requests for Examination to 31 months** may expedite patent examination but put pressure on applicants to prepare quickly.|
|**Working Statements**|Working statements are to be submitted once every 3 years by patent holders.|Requiring working statements once every 3 years may **reduce the frequency of reporting on patent usage**.|
|**Disclosure of Manufacturing Location and Price**|Disclosure of the patented product’s manufacturing location and price is no longer required.|Eliminating the need to disclose manufacturing location and price **may impact transparency in the pharmaceutical industry.**|

**About** [**The Patents Act, 1970**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/tag/indian-patent-act-1970/)

It was **established in 1972**, and replaced the **Indian Patents and Designs Act, 1911**. In 2005, the Patents (Amendment) Act expanded product patenting to all technology fields, including food, drugs, chemicals, and microorganisms. It repealed **Exclusive Marketing Rights (EMRs)** provisions, introduced compulsory licensing, and included pre-grant and post-grant opposition provisions

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus: Science and Technology**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/what-is-geospatial-intelligence-a-geographer-explains-the-powerful-melding-of-maps-and-data/article67344191.ece#:~:text=organizations%20protect%20communities.-,Geospatial%20intelligence%20is%20the%20collection%20and%20integration%20of%20data%20from,threat%20is%20likely%20to%20emerge.)

 **What is** [**Geospatial intelligence**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/02/20/insights-into-editorial-why-india-is-opening-up-the-geo-spatial-sector/)**?**

It is the **collection and integration of data from various technologies** like satellites, sensors, and aerial images to create real-time maps and simulations. It aids in identifying and managing threats, supporting emergency response, environmental monitoring, logistics, and more.

**Geospatial technology** uses tools like **GIS** (Geographic Information System), **GPS** (Global Positioning System), and Remote Sensing for geographic mapping and analysis of Geospatial data.

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/policy-2022.png)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/policy-2022.png)

**Status of geospatial data and technology in India**

- India has a **robust ecosystem in geospatial**, with the Survey of India (SoI), the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), Remote Sensing Application Centres (RSACs), and the National Informatics Centre (NIC) in particular, and all ministries and departments, in general, using geospatial technology.
- In 2021, the geospatial market was dominated by defence and intelligence (14 %), urban development (13 %), and utilities (11 %) segments, cumulatively accounting for 38% of the total geospatial market.

**Key applications of geospatial intelligence:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Application**|**Description**|
|**Emergency Preparedness**|Monitoring natural disasters such as Cyclones, and hurricanes to allocate resources efficiently, issue timely storm warnings, and order evacuations as needed.|
|**Disaster Response**|Assisting in **post-disaster efforts by identifying damaged areas**, assessing the extent of impact, locating access points for first responders, facilitating efficient **search-and-rescue operations** and the distribution of aid.|
|**Environmental Monitoring**|Tracking **climate-related variables like temperature**, precipitation, and ice to anticipate and prepare for environmental disturbances, including heatwaves, floods, and polar ice melt.|
|**Military and Civilian Applications**|Reporting on **military movements, and troop deployments**, and providing valuable spatial data for civilian applications such as global supply chain optimization and logistics management.|
|**Transportation and Logistics**|Utilizing GPS-generated spatial data to enhance transportation and logistics operations|
|**Autonomous Vehicles**|Supporting the **development of autonomous vehicles** by offering high-resolution imagery for road analysis, and traffic management.|
|**Digital Twins**|Creating **virtual replicas of real-world systems**, such as cities and buildings, which can be updated in real-time to simulate changes in various conditions, aiding **decision-making across different sectors**, including military and urban planning.|

**Measures for the Development of Geospatial Data and Technology:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Measures**|**Description**|
|**Guidelines for Geospatial Data, 2021**|Released by the **Ministry of Science and Technology** in 2021.|
|**Deregulated and liberalized** the Geo-Spatial Sector in India, making it more competitive.|
|Eliminated the requirement of **permissions and scrutiny**, even for security concerns for Indian Companies.|
|Companies can now **self-attest, conforming to government guidelines** without continuous monitoring by a government agency.|
|**Geospatial Energy Map of India**|Developed in collaboration with **NITI Aayog and** [**ISRO**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/tag/isro/)|
|Provides a comprehensive view of **energy production and distribution** in the country.|
|Aids in **planning and investment decisions** and supports disaster management using available energy assets.|
|**Union Budget 2022-23**|Government support for the **use of Kisan drones** for land assessment, digitization of land records, and spraying insecticides and nutrients.|
|**National Geospatial Policy, 2022**|The 13-year guideline promotes the country’s geospatial data industry and develops a national framework to use such data for improving citizen services, and more|
|**Yuktahara portal**|Serves as a repository of **geotagged assets created under various National Rural Development Programs**, including MGNREGA, Per Drop More Crop Programs, Integrated Watershed Management Programme, and Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana.|

**Limitations of using Geospatial technology:**

- **Hacking information –** The primary reluctance to share stems from the concern that terrorists or criminals could use such information.
- **Privacy issue –** India doesn’t have a dedicated data protection policy in that context use of Geospatial data may cause privacy issues.
- **Lack of data availability and sharing constraints –** The unavailability of foundation data, especially at high resolution, is also a constraint. Further, the lack of clarity on data sharing and collaboration prevents co-creation and asset maximization.

**Measures to be taken for improvement.**

- **Trained and dedicated team** to use geospatial data
- **Funding to enhance the application** of geospatial technology
- **Privacy needs to be taken** into account while using Geospatial data.

**Conclusion** 

Today the availability of using high-resolution satellite imagery creates a positive environment on the significance of this technology for monitoring integrated systems in different areas of national security purposes. Thus, geospatial technology reduces the analysis time and improves the capability and efficiency in decision-making for national security issues.

### [Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Ganesh Chaturthi](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/09/26/bal-gangadhar-tilak-and-ganesh-chaturthi/)

#### **Content for Mains Enrichment**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/bal-gangadhar-tilak-lord-ganesh-festival-8952750/)

[**Bal Gangadhar Tilak**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/07/25/bal-gangadhar-tilak/) played a pivotal role in transforming the Ganesh Chaturthi festival into a grand community event in India.

Before 1893, **Ganesh Chaturthi was a one-day private** observance. However, Tilak, a prominent nationalist and leader, saw an opportunity to unite and mobilize society against British colonial rule by harnessing **Indian cultural practices**. He initiated the tradition of **public Ganpati worship**, emphasizing **patriotism**, and promoting **nationalist** ideas during the festival.

**Negative impact:** While Tilak’s efforts were **praised for fostering unity**, he also faced criticism for **potentially adding a communal aspect** to the freedom struggle and holding conservative views on women’s emancipation and caste reforms.

**Usage**: The example can be used to show how culture can be used to unite people. But overemphasis on the culture of one community can be decisive as well. The example also shows the value of Unity, Inclusivity, Nationalism, Respect for Cultural Heritage etc.

**Context:** The greater **one-horned** [**rhino**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/09/24/world-rhino-day-september-22/) **population in India and Nepal is growing**, as highlighted in the **State of the Rhino Report, 2023**, by the **International Rhino Foundation (IRF).**

- While **poaching and habitat loss remain significant** threats to rhinos globally, **climate change is also impacting their survival.**

**Key Findings:**

- The collaboration among **India, Bhutan, and Nepal**, along with strict government protection and management, has **led to a 20 per cent increase in their population over the past decade. India is estimated to be home to 3,262 rhinos.**
- **Black rhino populations are increasing despite poaching pressure**. However, South Africa is grappling with devastating poaching losses of its white rhinos, particularly in certain reserves.
- One concerning aspect highlighted in the **report is that the status and whereabouts of 12 of the approximately 76 remaining Javan rhinos are unknown**. **Sumatran rhinos** are also increasingly difficult to find, raising uncertainty about their population in the wild.

The report underscores the need for continued efforts to protect and conserve rhinos and their habitats, address poaching, and mitigate the effects of climate change to ensure the survival of these iconic species.
