### [Fraternity in the Indian Constitution](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/09/14/fraternity-in-the-indian-constitution/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: Indian Constitution**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://www.thehindu.com/specials/text-and-context/how-fraternity-in-india-is-different-from-the-idea-enshrined-in-the-constitution/article67300501.ece#:~:text=The%20privileging%20of%20the%20idea,assess%20fraternal%20ties%20in%20India.)

 **Context:** The article discusses how the concept of [fraternity](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/29/the-concept-of-fraternity/) in India, as enshrined in the Constitution, differs significantly from its historical and philosophical origins.

**We published an article on a similar theme in April Daily CA: [The concept of fraternity](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/29/the-concept-of-fraternity/)**

**What is** [**Fraternity**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/29/the-concept-of-fraternity/)**?**

According to **Dr. Ambedkar** “Fraternity means a **sense of common brotherhood** **of all Indians** — of Indians being one people. It is the **principle which gives unity and solidarity** to social life,”.

No one should treat a fellow citizen as inferior. While the **morals of the** [**Preamble**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/indian-constitution/significant-provisions/preamble/) **like**– Justice, Equality, and **Liberty** have been explicitly and implicitly ensured through **Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles** and other constitutional provisions, this is **not the case with Fraternity**.

**More about Fraternity:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Aspect**|**Description**|
|**Political Philosophy Roots**|Fraternity is deeply embedded in **political philosophy, emphasizing empowerment and emancipation in politics**. It’s a fundamental element of liberal political thought, alongside liberty and equality.|
|**Ancient Origins**|The concept traces back to **Plato**, who introduced it as **“philia” (love) involving** the sharing of **knowledge**, and deepening friendships. **Aristotle** later associated it with justice and **friendship within the “polis,”** marking its early political foundations.|
|**Historical Evolution**|Throughout the **Middle Ages, fraternity found resonance within Christianity** in Europe. It gained significant political prominence during [the **French Revolution**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/world-history/fresh-revolution/)**, notably with the famous slogan “liberté, égalité, fraternité.”**|
|**Fraternity in India**|Fraternity was underscored during India’s struggle for independence and is enshrined as a vital constitutional principle.|

**Fraternity’s Significance in India’s Independence:**

- **Foundational Role**: Liberty, equality, and fraternity were pivotal ideals during India’s independence struggle and the establishment of its constitutional democracy. They provided guidance to a diverse society transitioning into an independent republic.
- **Ambedkar’s Emphasis:** Ambedkar emphasized the inseparability of liberty, equality, and fraternity. He recognized the **fraternity’s crucial role in India’s diverse** and divided society.
- **Demand**: It became an **official demand of the** [**Indian National Congress**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/modern-indian-history/foundation-of-the-indian-national-congress/) **in 1935** and was officially adopted in **the Lucknow session in April 1936** presided by Jawaharlal Nehru, who also drafted the Objectives Resolution.

**Constitutional Provisions:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Constitutional Provision**|**Description**|
|**Preamble**|The [Preamble](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/indian-constitution/significant-provisions/preamble/) of the Indian Constitution mentions fraternity as one of its objectives. It ends with “…**and to promote among them all fraternity assuring the dignity** of the individual and the unity and integrity of the Nation.”|
|**Directive Principles of State Policy**|[**Article 38**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/indian-constitution/significant-provisions/dpsps/classification-of-dpsps/socialist-dpsps/)**:** The state shall strive to promote the welfare of the people by securing and protecting a social order that fosters fraternity among the citizens.|
|**Fundamental Duties**|[**Article 51A(e**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/tag/article-51a/)**):** The **duty of every citizen** to promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood among all the people of India transcending **religious, linguistic, and regional diversities**|

**Fraternity meaning in the constitution:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Meaning**|**Description**|
|**Signifies moral obligation**|Fraternity in the Constitution implies a moral obligation to treat fellow human beings justly and respectfully, prioritizing **social cohesion over individual identity.**|
||**Acharya Kripalani** pointed out that the contents of the Preamble were not only legal and political principles but also had **moral, spiritual and mystical content.**|
|**Pillar of constitutional morality**|It is one of the four pillars of constitutional morality as stated in the Preamble, alongside **justice, liberty, and equality**|
|**Affirming the dignity of the individual**|Fraternity in the Constitution affirms the **dignity of the individual** by recognizing moral equality and mutual respect among individuals despite differences in religious beliefs, caste, language, culture, ethnicity, class, and gender.|

**Challenges in Achieving Fraternity:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Challenges**|**Description**|
|**Social and Cultural Differences**|Differences based on religion or caste may result in mistrust, discrimination, and violence.|
|**Economic Disparities**|Economic disparities can lead to a breakdown in social cohesion, a key aspect of fraternity|
|**Political Differences**|**Polarization** along political lines can foster hostility and intolerance, hindering common goals.|
|**Lack of Trust**|A lack of trust and mutual understanding **undermines the spirit of brotherhood.**|
|**Failure of Constitutional Morality**|Its failure can lead to a **loss of confidence in institutions** and the rule of law, creating instability.|
|**Inadequate Moral Order**|Failure in this area can erode fraternity, as unethical actions without consequences hinder trust.|

**Measures to Achieve Fraternity in the Indian Context:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Measures**|**Description**|
|**Promote Interfaith Dialogue**|Encourage dialogue and understanding among diverse religious communities to build fraternity.|
|**Celebrate Diversity**|Embrace and celebrate India’s cultural and religious diversity to bring people closer.|
|**Educate People About Constitutional Values**|Educate citizens about the values enshrined in the Indian Constitution, including fraternity.|
|**Encourage Volunteering**|Engage people in volunteering for social causes to foster cooperation and a sense of fraternity.|
|**Support Social Initiatives**|Back social initiatives that promote inclusivity and equality, contributing to the fraternity.|
|**Foster a Sense of National Pride**|Promote patriotism and national pride to unite people, enhancing fraternity and unity.|

**Conclusion**

Ambedkar dreamed of an India in which divisions of caste and religion would gradually fade away in the spirit of fraternity. Therefore, investing in concepts like fraternity would save society from fragmentation.

|**2023**|Special Session to commemorate Parliament’s 75-year journey.|

**The Indian Parliament** **has become disconnected from society and turned into a gated community:**

- **Nepotism in Politics: The presence of dynastic politics in Indian democracy** is perpetuated not only by national parties but also by regional parties.
- **The increasing criminalisation of politics**: In a petition filed in Feb 2023, it was claimed that there has been an increase of 44% in the number of MPs with declared criminal cases since 2009 (ADR report).
- **Wealthy politicians but poor citizens: The percentage of persons with a net worth above INR 1 crore** has only been increasing over the 2 decades.
    - As per reports by the Association for Democratic Reforms, there are 315 members whose net worth exceeds INR 1 crore in a 543-member Lok Sabha.
- **The lower number of women parliamentarians:** The % **of women in Lok Sabha is less than 15%** and even lower in Rajya Sabha, which stands at around 13%.
- **Not inclusive**: The number of Muslim MPs in 2019 has only increased by 3. There has been **no representation of the transgender community** in the Indian Parliament so far.
- **Lack of Transparency**: E.g., very short time given to scrutinize many of the bills. Several bills have been passed as money bills to limit Rajya Sabha scrutiny
    - Parliament and parliamentarians are **generally not accessible** for ordinary citizens to interact or express grievances.

**Despite these lacunas, the Indian parliament has made a substantial effort to be an inclusive institution:** 

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Aspect**|**Examples**|
|**Representation**|The percentage of women’s representation in Lok Sabha has **increased from 5% in 1951 to 14% in 2019**. In the early decades, the Parliament was a stronghold of lawyers but in the past two decades, people from **diverse educational backgrounds have entered the Parliament**.|
|**Public Debates**|Citizens can watch live debates on important issues, such as budget discussions and legislative debates.|
|**Parliamentary Committees**|Committees like the Standing Committee on Finance analyze budgets and address economic concerns. E.g., the Parliamentary panel asked the former RBI governor to present himself before it, so as to answer questions regarding demonetization.|
|**Laws for Social Welfare**|Legislation like the Food Security Act 2023 and increasing reservation has helped provide representation to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in educational and public services|
|**Amendments to Address Needs**|**Amendments to labour laws to protect workers’ rights** and accommodate changing employment dynamics.|
|**Public Participation**|e-Petitions allow citizens to raise concerns, and petitions are addressed in the Parliament. Many of the state assemblies have completely become paperless.|

**Conclusion**

The Indian Parliament is a **symbol of the nation’s democratic ethos**. And hence, efforts to strengthen representation, accessibility and inclusivity are essential for addressing the needs and aspirations of the diverse Indian population.

**Source:** [**WTO**](https://www.wto.org/english/blogs_e/ce_ralph_ossa_e/blog_ro_12sep23_e.htm#:~:text=The%20main%20conclusion%20is%20that,call%20%E2%80%9Cre%2Dglobalization%E2%80%9D.)

 **Context:** The 2023 World Trade Report, published by the [WTO](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/19/reforming-wto/), explores the role of international trade in **building a more secure, inclusive, and sustainable world**.

**Key findings of the report:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Key Themes**|**Major Highlights**|
|**Changing Narrative**|The report addresses the **shift in the narrative around** [**globalization**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/10/globalization-has-facilitated-the-exchange-of-ideas-knowledge-and-technology-between-india-and-the-rest-of-the-world-critically-analyse-the-impact-of-globalization-on-indian-society-and-culture/).|
|It emphasizes **policy goals beyond trade efficiency**, including peace, security, poverty reduction, and sustainability.|
|The report advocates for **“re-globalization,”** expanding trade integration to more economies, people, and issues.|
|**Geopolitical Shifts**|Geopolitical tensions, the Ukraine conflict, and the rise of China have impacted global trade dynamics.|
|The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of **resilient supply chains.**|
|**Reorientation of Trade**|Trade is gradually **aligning along geopolitical lines**.|
|Trade flows within **hypothetical geopolitical “blocs” are growing faster than those between them**, indicating a **shift towards friend-shoring**.|
|**Resilience in Trade**|Despite challenges, bilateral trade between **China and the United States** reached record highs.|
|**Supply Chain**|**International supply chains** played a vital role in responding to supply shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic.|
|**Inclusiveness**|Trade integration has **lifted millions out of poverty**.|
|**Sustainability**|Trade can contribute **to sustainability by providing access to green technologies**.|

**What is re-globalization?**

Re-globalization is a concept that **advocates expanding and strengthening international trade and economic integration**, focusing on making [**globalization**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-economy-3/foreign-trade-and-international-organizations/impact-of-globalization-on-indian-economy/) **more inclusive, secure, and sustainable.**

It emphasizes the **need to address contemporary global challenges**, such as geopolitical tensions, economic inequality, and climate change, through **greater cooperation and trade integration among nations**.

**Re-globalization vs.** [**de-globalisation**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Deglobalisation.pdf)**:**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Aspect**|**Re-globalization**|**De-globalization**|
|**Focus**|Expand and strengthen international trade and economic integration.|Reduce international trade and economic interdependence.|
|**Goals**|Make globalization more inclusive, secure, and sustainable by addressing global challenges through cooperation.|Prioritize domestic industries and reduce reliance on foreign markets.|
|**Key Principles**|Maintain a strong multilateral trading system, and extend trade integration to more economies, people, and issues.|Advocate protectionist measures, trade barriers, and focus on national self-sufficiency.|
|**Example**|Promote trade as a solution to challenges like economic inequality and climate change.|Implement tariffs, trade restrictions, and reshoring of production to prioritize domestic interests.|

**The benefits of re-globalization:**

- **Economic Growth:** Re-globalization, as seen in India during 1994-2005, can **stimulate economic growth**, leading to a decrease in the poverty rate.
- **Poverty Alleviation**: The decrease in the headcount poverty rate by around **1.****5 points** indicates that **re-globalization can contribute to poverty alleviation** by expanding economic opportunities and income distribution.
- **Promoting Environmental Sustainability**: Re-globalization fosters international coordination on environmental policies.
- **Emission Reduction:** The reallocation of resources from less efficient to more efficient firms, as observed in India between 1990 and 2010, can lead to a significant drop in emission intensity.

**Role of** [**WTO**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/19/reforming-wto/) **in Fostering Re-globalization:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Role of WTO**|**Examples**|
|**Supporting Multilateral Trading Rules**|Enforcing trade rules and agreements among member countries.|
|**Addressing Global Challenges**|Facilitating discussions on trade’s role in peace and security.|

### [VVPAT](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/09/14/vvpat-3/)

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/100-vvpat-count-demand-elections-explained-8936188/)

 **Context:** A petition **by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR)** has called for the **100% counting of** [**Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/03/23/voter-verifiable-paper-audit-trail-vvpat/)**) slips** during elections as the **current system fails to guarantee that votes are counted as cast.**

- Currently, the [**Election Commission of India**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/appointment-to-various-constitutional-posts-powers-functions-and-responsibilities-of-various-constitutional-bodies/election-commission/) **(ECI)** mandates **counting VVPAT slips in five randomly selected polling stations** per Assembly constituency or segment.
- The **ECI responded** by stating that **counting all VVPAT slips** **in every election would revert to manual polling methods via indirect means.**
- Initially, **one polling station’s VVPAT slips per Assembly constituency were counted, later increased to five stations after a Supreme Court judgment in 2019**.

**About VVPATs:**
