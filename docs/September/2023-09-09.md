### [Banglar mati, Banglar jol](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/09/09/banglar-mati-banglar-jol/)

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/tagore-banglar-mati-banglar-jol-bengal-anthem-8930856/)

**Context:** The West Bengal Assembly has **declared Poila Baishakh (April 15),** the first day of the **Bengali calendar**, as the **statehood day and designated Rabindranath Tagore’s “Banglar mati, Banglar jol” as the state anthem**.

**Significance of the song:**

- The song was **written by Tagore in 1905** in response to **Lord Curzon’s partition of Bengal, which was a divisive colonial strategy to weaken the nationalist movement.**
- [**Curzon’s**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/01/03/lord-curzon/#:~:text=Curzon%20by%20his%20impolitic%20utterances,stung%20political%20life%20in%20India.) **decision to partition Bengal in 1905** aimed to create division and strife among the diverse Bengali-speaking population. However**, it had the opposite effect**, as it **united Bengalis against British rule and ignited the** [**Swadeshi Movement**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/modern-indian-history/national-movement-1885-1919/swadeshi-movement/)**,** which marked the beginning of the Indian struggle for independence.
- Tagore was a vocal critic of the partition and expressed his support for the Swadeshi Movement through his songs and poems. **“Banglar mati, Banglar jol” called for unity among Bengalis** by **celebrating the beauty of Bengal, its natural surroundings, language, people, and soul.**
- This song became an anthem for the movement against the partition **and was sung during passionate processions and demonstrations that emphasized Bengali unity**.
- Tagore even tied rakhis to Muslims as a symbol of brotherhood and unity. Ultimately, **Bengal was reunited in 1911 but would later be partitioned again in 1947.**

The declaration **of “Banglar mati, Banglar jol”** as the state anthem is a testament to its enduring **significance in invoking feelings of brotherhood and patriotism among Bengalis**.

- The **guidelines define dark patterns** as **deceptive design patterns in user interface/experience (UI/UX) interactions that impair consumer autonomy and violate consumer rights.**

**Types of** [**Dark Pattern**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/17/dark-patterns-in-digital-advertisements/)**s****:**

- The draft guidelines **identify ten types of dark patterns**, including **false urgency, basket sneaking (adding extra items without user consent during checkout), confirm shaming (using fear or shame to nudge user actions), forced action (compelling additional purchases), and subscription traps (making cancellation difficult).**

The guidelines **will apply to all platforms systematically offering goods or services in India**, including **advertisers and sellers**.

 **Context:** The **Reserve Bank of India (RBI)** has announced the **discontinuation of the incremental cash reserve ratio (I-CRR)** in a phased manner.

- The I-CRR was aimed at **absorbing surplus liquidity in the banking system, primarily due to various factors like the return of Rs 2,000 banknotes, government spending, and capital inflows.**

**About I-CRR:**

Banks are **typically required to maintain 4.5 per cent of their Net Demand and Time Liabilities as** [**CRR**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/02/11/what-is-crr-or-cash-reserve-ratio/) **with the RBI**.

However, **in periods of excess liquidity**, the **RBI can impose incremental CRR, which means that banks will have to park even more liquid cash with the RBI**. This measure helps **the central bank manage liquidity and acts as a buffer during times of stress in the banking system.**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/billion-light-year-wide-bubble-of-galaxies-discovered/article67285040.ece)

 **Context:**  Astronomers have discovered **a massive “bubble of galaxies**” in the nearby universe, approximately **820 million light years away from our Milky Way galaxy.**

- This **cosmic structure spans a billion light years in diameter**, making it **about 10,000 times wider than our galaxy.**
- Inside the bubble, there is the **Bootes supercluster of** [**galaxies**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/world-geography/physical-geography-of-the-world/origin-and-evolution-of-universe-solar-system/origin-and-evolution-of-the-earth/formation-of-galaxies-and-stars/), surrounded by a **vast void referred to as “the Great Nothing**.”
- The discovery confirms a phenomenon **first theorized by cosmologist Jim Peebles in 1970, where sound waves created bubbles in the early universe,** and these structures have been preserved over time.

This **bubble, named Ho’oleilana, r**epresents the first known **single baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO)** and was **discovered by chance during a search through new galaxy catalogues**. The finding opens the possibility of discovering more such bubbles across the universe using advanced telescopes.

**Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO)** are **regular, periodic fluctuations** **or ripples** in the distribution of **matter (primarily baryonic matter, which includes protons and neutrons)** in the universe.

These oscillations are a **fundamental feature of the large-scale structure** of the cosmos and provide **important clues about its geometry, expansion rate, and the distribution of dark matter and dark energy.**
