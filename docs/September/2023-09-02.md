### [Simultaneous elections](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/09/02/simultaneous-elections/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: Elections**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/govt-committee-simultaneous-elections-explained-8918921/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20holding%20of%20simultaneous%20elections,iii) [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/3-mn-evms-massive-security-and-funds-challenges-in-holding-simultaneous-polls-8920400/)

 **Context:** The Government has formed a committee, headed by former [**President Ram Nath Kovind**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/07/14/editorial-analysis-the-president-is-not-a-mere-rubber-stamp/), to explore the possibility of **“**[**one nation, one election**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/03/12/one-nation-one-election-3/)**,” which** refers to holding simultaneous Lok Sabha (Parliament) and state assembly elections.

**What is** [**one nation, one election**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/03/12/one-nation-one-election-3/) **(ONOE)?**

The concept of “**one nation, one election” refers to holding elections to** [**Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/parliament-and-state-legislatures/) **simultaneously, once in five years**.

**Background:**

[**Simultaneous elections**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Simultaneous-Elections.pdf) were held in the country **during the first two decades after Independence up to 1967. The dissolution of certain Assemblies in 1968 and 1969 followed by the dissolution of the Lok Sabha led to the disruption** of the conduct of simultaneous elections.

**Benefits of “one nation, one election”**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Benefit**|**Description**|
|**Reducing Election Expenditure**|Conducting all elections simultaneously **minimizes expenses** on logistics, security, and campaigning.|
|**Better Governance**|Simultaneous elections allow elected governments to **focus on governance** rather than preparing for the next election. It will help in **streamlining the election cycle to avoid policy disruptions** due to the [**Model Code of Conduct**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/12/15/model-code-of-conduct/)|
|**Voter Convenience**|Ensures voters are **not subjected to multiple rounds of voting**, leading to **better turnout** and voter convenience.|
|**Reduced Security Concerns**|Conducting elections together **reduces overall security concerns** and enhances security setup across the country.|
|**Level Playing Field**|Provides a **level playing field for all parties and candidates**, promoting fairness and transparency in elections.|
|**Reduced Impact on Education**|Simultaneous elections **reduce the impact on the education sector**, as fewer teachers are involved in the electoral process.|

**Challenges of “One Nation, One Election”:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Challenge**|**Description**|
|**Constitutional Challenges**|Requires **constitutional amendments**, necessitating consensus among political parties and states, a complex and lengthy process.|
|**Anti-federal**|Assembly elections focus on **local issues**, and combining them with general elections may **overshadow regional narratives**.|
|**Logistical challenges**|Conducting all elections simultaneously **involves logistical arrangements,** security deployment, voter rolls, and polling booth management, leading to administrative difficulties.<br>Need for approximately **30 lakh** [**electronic voting machines**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2017/03/17/insights-editorial-credibility-electronic-voting-machines/) (EVMs) and voter-verified paper audit trail [**(VVPAT) machines**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/03/23/voter-verifiable-paper-audit-trail-vvpat/)|
|**Possibility of Domination by National Parties**|Simultaneous **elections may favour national parties** with more resources, potentially marginalizing regional parties and issues.|
|**Impact on Democracy**|Voters may struggle to **engage with all issues simultaneously**, potentially leading to uninformed choices and undermining the democratic process.|

**Way forward**

- **Recommendation of** [**Parliamentary Standing Committee**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/14/the-role-of-parliamentary-committees/#:~:text=A%20committee%20appointed%2Felected%20by,or%20to%20the%20Speaker%2FChairman.) **on Law and Justice: A** **two-phase election schedule**, according to which elections to some legislative assemblies whose term **end within six months** **to one year** before or after the election date could be held during the **midterm of Lok Sabha**. For the rest of the states, elections could be held along with the general elections to Lok Sabha.
- Cost can be brought under control by ensuring that the **legal cap on the expenditure of candidates is followed by all parties.**
- Concept of **One year, One election** will be easier than ONOE, and will have the same benefits.

**International Examples**: Simultaneous Elections are successfully held in **South Africa (national and provincial), and Sweden** (including local elections as well on the same day).

**Conclusion:**

While the idea of “One nation, one election” has its own merits, it is important to consider the **practical challenges and limitations** of implementing it. A **comprehensive study** is required to examine the feasibility of this concept in India.

### [Concerns about RTI Act](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/09/02/concerns-about-rti-act/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: Governance**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/explained-has-right-to-information-weakened-over-the-years/article67259315.ece#:~:text=While%20activists%20have%20long%20warned,to%20conveniently%20file%20requests%20and)

 **Context:** The [Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005](https://www.insightsonindia.com/governance/governance-important-aspects/transparency/right-to-information-act/#:~:text=About%20the%20RTI%20Act%2C%202005,constitution%20'freedom%20of%20speech'.), which was initially seen as a powerful tool for citizens to access government information, is **facing concerns about its effectiveness and transparency**

**What is the RTI Act?**

RTI Act (enacted in 2005) replaced the former Freedom of Information Act, 2002. Under the provisions of the RTI Act, **any citizen of India may request information from a “**[**public authority**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/06/01/pm-cares-fund-not-a-public-authority-under-rti-act/)**“** which is required to reply expeditiously or within thirty days.

**Significance of RTI:**

The Second Administrative Reforms Commission (**2nd ARC)** lauds the Right to Information (RTI) as the **“master key of good governance**.” This legislation marks a significant paradigm shift, transitioning from **the veil of secrecy to the light of transparency.**

Often termed the **dawn of a new era in democracy**, RTI initiates the second democratic revolution, empowering citizens to access information crucial for an informed and accountable governance system.

**Success  of RTI**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Success**|**Details and Impact**|
|**Empowering Citizens**|**Over 50 lakh RTIs** are filed annually, showcasing extensive use.<br>**Public offices (90%)** proactively share RTI-related information, promoting openness.|
|**Access to Vital Information**|RTI grants access to **crucial information like competitive exam answer** keys (IIT JEE, Civil Services), ensuring fairness.<br>Disclosure of **property details of public officials** helps prevent conflicts of interest.|
|**Exposing Scams and Corruption**|RTI played a pivotal role in **uncovering major scams** like the Commonwealth Games and 2G spectrum allocations.<br>Fosters **accountability and corrective actions** against wrongdoings.|
|**Global Influence and Inspiration**|The adoption **of similar information access laws in Sri Lanka** underscores India’s impactful legal framework.<br>Reflects **India’s positive global influence** and effective governance practices.|
|**Transparency and Anti-Corruption Efforts**|RTI promotes transparency in diverse sectors and empowers citizens in democratic processes.<br>Recognized by Transparency International for combating corruption through exposure and accountability.|

**Areas of Concern with the RTI Act:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Aspects of the RTI Act**|**Details and Impact**|
|**Amendments**|The [**Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/16/impact-of-the-dpdp-bill-on-the-rti-act/#:~:text=The%20Digital%20Personal%20Data%20Protection%20Bill%20must%20ensure%20that%20individuals,21%20of%20the%20Indian%20constitution.), made significant amendments to the RTI Act, particularly regarding the **disclosure of personal data.**<br>This change has raised **concerns about the impact of social audits** and public officials’ accountability.|
|**Union Government’s Control**|The **Right to Information (Amendment) Act, 2019,** granted the Union Government unilateral power in deciding the tenure and salaries of information commissioners, affecting their independence.|
|**Rules and Appointments**|The implementation of the RTI Act depends on **rules made by the Union and State Governments.** This can lead to complications, as states have discretion in **deciding payment methods for public authority fees**.<br>**Delayed appointments to information commissions** have also undermined the RTI framework.|
|**Online RTIs**|While filing RTI applications online has made the process more accessible, some states lack online portals. The Union **Government’s RTI portal** has faced issues, including data loss and a more complex application process.|
|**Low Satisfaction**|Dissatisfaction with the RTI system is growing, as more citizens file first appeals, **indicating their dissatisfaction with the information** received from public officials.|
|**Structural Problems**|Many of the issues faced by the RTI Act **stem from institutional and website-related problems**, as well as narrowing avenues to conveniently file requests and appeals.|
|**Limited Applicability**|The RTI Act’s limitations regarding its **applicability to political parties**, the **judiciary**, and **intelligence agencies** have been subject to debate.<br>Moreover, the Act’s limited applicability to **NGOs and private entities** narrows its reach.|
|**Non-compliance**|**Over 26% rejection rate of RTI applications** on spurious grounds as per DoPT data. Appeals processes are delayed|
|**Safety of Activists and Lack of Centralized Database**|The safety of RTI activists remains a concern due to **instances of violence and fatalities.** Additionally, the absence of a centralized database hampers data access, impacting the Act’s intended transparency|
|**Inconsistent Record Management**|**Poor record management** by Public Information Officers (PIOs) leads to response delays and incomplete information|
|**Grievance Redressed Backlog**|Enforcing fines for **non-compliance remains weak**, with only a 1% imposition rate|

**Conclusion:**

**While the RTI Act initially empowered citizens** to seek government information, concerns have arisen about its diminishing effectiveness due to changes in the law, bureaucratic processes, and structural issues. These challenges threaten its role in ensuring transparency and accountability in government operations.

### [Omission of disability-related questions from NFHS-6](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/09/02/omission-of-disability-related-questions-from-nfhs-6/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus****: Social Justice – Persons With Disabilities**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/indian-government-does-not-understand-disability-decisions-for-nfhs-6-are-proof-8918424/)

**Context:** The decision to **omit disability-related questions from the sixth round of the** [**National Family Health Survey**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/11/25/nfhs-survey/) **(NFHS-6)** has raised concerns about the **understanding and representation of disability issues in India.**

- **Persons with disabilities make up around 2.21% of** the country’s population, which is **approximately 2.68 crore people according to the 2011 Census.**

**Reasons for under representation of** [**Persons with Disabilities**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/28/persons-with-disabilities/)**:**

- The **inadequate understanding of the term “disability**.”
- The government report on **‘Persons with Disabilities (Divyangjan) in India – A Statistical Profile: 2021’** only acknowledges **eight categories of disabilities**, failing to **account for the 21 categories recognized by the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPWDA).**
- This oversight is **particularly concerning for “invisible disabilities**,” such as mental health-related illnesses, which affect **nearly 24 lakh persons but are not adequately addressed in the data.**

**Issues because of under representation of Persons with Disabilities:**

- **Lack of Accurate Data**: Without including questions related to disabilities, it becomes challenging to gather accurate and up-to-date data on the disabled population in India.
- **Invisibility of Invisible Disabilities:** Many disabilities, particularly “**invisible disabilities” like mental health conditions**, often go unnoticed or unreported. The omission of questions related to such **conditions exacerbates the invisibility of these disabilities**.
- **Limited Policy Insights**: Policies and programs designed to support people with disabilities may not be comprehensive or targeted effectively **without a clear understanding of the disability landscape.**
- **Exclusion from Development Goals:** The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) emphasize the inclusion and empowerment of people with disabilities.
- **Barriers to Accessing Services:** People with disabilities **often face barriers in accessing healthcare**, **education, employment, and social services**.
- **Underreporting of Disabilities**: When individuals do not see their specific disabilities reflected in data collection efforts, **they may be less inclined to self-identify or seek support.**
- **Stigmatization and Discrimination:** When disabilities are not recognized or understood, individuals with **disabilities may face exclusion, bias, or negative stereotypes.**
- **Missed Opportunities:** Comprehensive data on disabilities can provide valuable insights into the diverse needs and experiences of people with disabilities.

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/special-session-of-parliament-8920401/)

 **Context:** The government has announced a **“special session” of Parliament** from September 18 to 22, and this has raised questions about the legislative agenda for the session.

**About the Special session:**

**The term “special session”** is **not defined in the Constitution** but is often used for sessions convened for **specific occasions or commemorating milestones**.

**Key points about the parliamentary special session:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Key Points**|**Description**|
|**Special Sessions**|The term **“special session”** may refer to **sessions convened for specific occasions or purposes**, often with limitations on parliamentary procedures. Presiding officers chair these sessions.|
|**Emergency Provisions**|[**Article 352 of the Constitution**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/indian-constitution/significant-provisions/emergency-provisions/#:~:text=Under%20Article%20352%2C%20the%20president,external%20aggression%20or%20armed%20rebellion.) **mentions** a “special sitting of the House” in the context of a Proclamation of Emergency. If Parliament is not in session, **one-tenth of Lok Sabha MPs can request** a special meeting to disapprove the Emergency.|
|**Determining Parliamentary Sessions**|The government, through the **Cabinet Committee on Parliamentary Affairs**, decides when Parliament meets, including session dates and durations.<br>The President is **informed of the Committee’s decisions**, and MPs are summoned for the session.|
|**Constitutional Requirement (Article 85)**|The Constitution mandates that **there should not be more than a six-month gap between two parliamentary sessions**. This provision was adapted from the [**Government of India Act of 1935**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/modern-indian-history/national-movement-1919-1939/government-of-india-act-1935/#:~:text=The%20Act%20of%201935%20abolished,introduced%20it%20at%20the%20Centre.&text=Religious%20affairs%2C%20defence%2C%20administration%20of,included%20in%20the%20reserved%20subjects.)|

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/tibetan-democracy-day-8920073/)  

**Context:** [**Tibetan Democracy Day**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/09/03/tibetan-democracy-day/), celebrated on **September 2nd**, marks the establishment of the **Tibetan democratic system in exile**.

- It commemorates the **inauguration of the Tibetan government-in-exile in Dharamshala over six decades ago**. The day is known as **Mangsto Duchen** and signifies the beginning of **Tibetan democracy, governing over 1 lakh Tibetan refugees worldwide** through the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA).

**Tibetan democratic system:**

The Tibetan democratic system **evolved with the first elected representatives taking their oaths in Bodh Gaya in 1960**, and the **Tibetan constitution**, based on democratic ideals and universal values, was enacted by the Dalai Lama in 1963.

In 1975, **the CTA declared September 2nd as the founding day of Tibetan democracy**. The system comprises three pillars of democracy, **including the executive head known as the Sikyong, who took over from the Dalai Lama in 2011.**

India maintains a **policy of not recognizing a separate government of Tibet in India** but regards the **Dalai Lama as a revered religious** leader. Tibetans in exile recognize the CTA as their legitimate government.

### [BS 6 Stage II ‘Electrified Flex Fuel Vehicle’](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/09/02/bs-6-stage-ii-electrified-flex-fuel-vehicle/)

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**PIB**](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1953249)

 **Context:** Toyota Kirloskar Motor has launched the **world’s first prototype of a BS 6 Stage II ‘Electrified Flex Fuel Vehicle’ in India**.

This vehicle combines a flex-fuel engine with an electric powertrain, offering greater use of **ethanol and improved fuel efficiency**. It aligns with India’s stricter emission standards and has **the potential to utilize excess ethanol resources**.

**What are** [**Flex Fuel Vehicles**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/04/15/flex-fuel-vehicles-2/) **(FFVs) and Electrified Flex Fuel Vehicles?**

**Flex Fuel Vehicles (FFVs):** It is designed to **run on a flexible combination of fuels**, typically **gasoline and ethanol**. These vehicles are equipped with engines that can adjust **their fuel mixture based** on the available fuel blend E.g., E20 (20% ethanol and 80% gasoline) or even higher percentages.

**Electrified Flex Fuel Vehicles:** They are a **more advanced version of FFVs** that

offer the advantage of **being able to operate on both ethanol-based fuels and electricity,** providing increased fuel efficiency and potentially reducing emissions compared to traditional gasoline-only vehicles.

**Significance:**

- These vehicles offer higher ethanol use and better fuel efficiency similar to **Strong Hybrid Electric Vehicles (SHEVs)**
- **Electrified Flex Fuel Vehicles** use minimal advanced chemistry batteries to reduce dependence on imports.

**Challenges:**

- **Higher cost of ownership and running cost for customers**, which may affect their acceptance unless retail fuel prices are competitive.
- **Developing FFVs requires significant effort** and calibration with multiple fuel blends, making them less viable without widespread fuel availability.
