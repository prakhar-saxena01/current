### [Suicides in India](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/09/25/suicides-in-india/)

#### **GS1/GS2 Paper** 

 **Syllabus: Indian Society**

**Source:** [**TOI**](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-suicide-cluster-in-kota-is-a-public-health-emergency/articleshow/103872918.cms?from=mdr)

 **Context:** The article discusses the alarming increase in student suicides in Kota, India, describing it as a **“suicide cluster**” that demands a public health approach.

**What are** [**Suicides**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/19/academic-distress-and-student-suicides-in-india/)**?**

Suicide refers to **intentional acts where individuals** cause their own death. **A suicide cluster** occurs when suicides, attempts, or self-harm events happen closer in time and space than expected, forming a pattern.

**Example**: In Kota, India, a suicide cluster mainly affects students preparing for exams in residential coaching centres. These clusters can lead to **contagion**, where one person’s suicide can **trigger suicidal thoughts or attempts in others** who are already vulnerable.

**Reasons for Rising** [**Student Suicide**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/19/academic-distress-and-student-suicides-in-india/)**:**

- **Social Stigma**: not enough discussion about depression and suicides
- Academic Pressure
- Relationship breakdown.
- **Lack of adequate support**: the ‘Log Kya Kahenge’ attitude (‘What will people say’) in Indian society is a permanent feature in the lives of competitive exam aspirants.
- **High expectations** from Students.
- **Mental Issues:**Anxiety disorder, depression, personality disorder.

**Suicides among women in India**

Women in India account for over one-third of global female suicide deaths. According to NCRB data, in the year 2021, over 45 thousand women died by suicide.

**Several complex and interconnected factors contribute to this concerning issue of increasing female suicides**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Factors Contributing to Female Suicides**|**Description**|
|[**Mental Health Stigma**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/10/11/address-stigma-in-mental-health/)|The stigma around mental health can deter young women from seeking professional help.|
|**Marital Pressures**|Early and forced marriages, dysfunctional marriages, domestic abuse, and dowry harassment increase suicide risk.|
|**Housewives**|Over 50% of female suicides in India are among housewives (NCRB data).|
|**Societal Contradictions**|The conflict between increasing female education and empowerment and persistent gender disparities.|
|**Gender Discrimination**|Disparities in access to education, employment, and decision-making lead to hopelessness and frustration.|
|**Social Media and Peer Pressure**|Exposure to cyberbullying, revenge pornography, and peer pressure affects self-esteem and body image.|
|**Educational Stress**|High expectations from parents and society cause stress, anxiety, and depression.|
|**Economic Factors**|Financial struggles, unemployment, and financial dependence, such as single mothers facing challenges.|

**Government steps taken:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Initiative**|**Description**|
|[**National Suicide Prevention Strategy**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/11/22/mission-2023-insights-daily-current-affairs-pib-summary-22-november-2022/) **(NSPS)**|Aims to reduce suicides by 10% by 2030.|
|[**Suicide Surveillance Systems**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/11/22/mission-2023-insights-daily-current-affairs-pib-summary-22-november-2022/)|Targeted at establishing effective suicide surveillance systems within the next three years.|
|**Mental Health Outpatient Clinics**|A goal under NSPS is to set up mental health outpatient clinics providing suicide prevention services within five years.|
|**Helplines in Various States**|Several states (e.g., Telangana, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu) have launched suicide prevention helplines.|
|[**MANAS program**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/07/chatbot-for-people-in-mental-distress/) **in Maharashtra**, strict law enforcement against dowry, child marriage, and forced marriages, and efforts by **NGOs like Snehi and Vandrevala Foundation** contribute to suicide prevention efforts.|   |

**For: “Student Cell”: For suicide prevention:** [**Click Here**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/09/13/student-cell-for-suicide-prevention/)

**What more should be done?**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Action**|**Description**|
|**Implement a Response Plan**|Develop and enforce a **Suicide Cluster Response Plan** involving surveillance, consistent information sharing between agencies, and support for those bereaved by suicide.|
|**Media Responsibility**|Encourage media to report **responsibly on suicides to** prevent contagion.|
|**Regular Monitoring and Review**|Continuously assess the effectiveness of the response and adapt strategies based on lessons learned.|
|**Adopt Successful Models**|Consider adopting successful approaches like the **Tomorrow Project** in Nottingham, UK, which halted suicide contagion through community information, meetings, and clinical support.|

**Ethical Perspective of Suicide:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Ethical Perspectives**|**Description**|
|**Moralists**|Suicide prevention is a moral obligation. Philosophers like **Kant** argue that humanity should be **considered an end in itself**, and using oneself as a means to an end (suicide) is unacceptable.|
|**Plato emphasizes obligations to society**, making suicide inconsistent with the greater good.|
|Evident in countries like **Singapore and India,** where attempted suicide is punishable.|
|**Libertarians**|Suicide can be a **rational, carefully contemplated choice** to avoid pain or suffering.|
|Value freedom of choice, considering the decision to die by suicide a right.|
|Reflected in countries where suicidal behaviour is decriminalized or euthanasia is legalized|
|**Relativists**|The **acceptability of suicide varies based on a cost-benefit analysis** of situational, cultural, and contemporary variables.|
|The decision is influenced by **individual, family, and societal needs** at that moment|
|The analysis aims to **maximize social utility**, considering whether suicide benefits or harms society.|

**Conclusion**

Indian society needs more comprehensive efforts to create a supportive environment for all irrespective of age, background and economic conditions in order to mitigate these preventable deaths by suicides.

### [Parliamentary panel on MEME system in NEP 2020](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/09/25/parliamentary-panel-on-meme-system-in-nep-2020/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus:  Government Policies and Interventions**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/education/national-education-policy-2020-multiple-entry-multiple-exit-option-may-not-work-well-for-india-house-panel/article67341734.ece)

 **Context:** The [**Parliamentary Standing Committee**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/14/the-role-of-parliamentary-committees/#:~:text=A%20committee%20appointed%2Felected%20by,or%20to%20the%20Speaker%2FChairman.) **on Education** has advised the Indian government to hold discussions with stakeholders regarding the **multiple entry and multiple exit (MEME) system** proposed in the [**National Education Policy**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/issues-related-to-education-sector/new-education-policy/key-highlights-of-the-nep/) **(NEP) 2020**.

**What is a multiple entry and multiple exit (MEME) system?**

The Multiple Entry and Multiple Exit (MEME) system is an **educational approach that allows students in higher educatio**n to **enter and exit their academic programs** at various points, not necessarily following a traditional linear progression.

**Benefits**:

- It offers **students greater flexibility by permitting them to leave with certificates** or diplomas at different stages rather than completing a full degree program, which can suit their **individual needs and circumstances**.
- This system is intended to **provide diverse educational pathways** and enhance access to higher education.

**However, the parliamentary panel has criticised the MEME system due to:**

- **Uncertainty in Student Numbers:** The panel expressed concerns that the **high student population in India makes** it difficult for institutions to predict how many students will exit or join midway, leading to uncertainty in managing resources and maintaining pupil-teacher ratios.
- **Geographical Challenges**: Uneven distribution of higher educational institutions across the country, particularly in rural areas, poses challenges in implementing MEME effectively.
- **Lack of Clear Framework**: The panel noted that there is a need for comprehensive guidelines and a **well-defined framework for MEME options**, including specific eligibility criteria and credit transfer mechanisms.
    - Without these, the implementation of MEME could be problematic.
- **Potential for Devalued Degrees**: Some critics, including students and teachers, fear that the MEME system could **devalue degrees by allowing students to exit** with lower-level qualifications, potentially leading to a perception of producing cheap labour for the job market.
- **State-Level Opposition**: Some states, like **Kerala**, have decided not to implement MEME in their colleges and universities, highlighting a lack of uniformity in its acceptance across regions.
- **Dropout Concerns**: Experts and critics have **expressed concerns that the MEME** system could **increase dropout rates**, as students may opt for early exits without completing full-degree programs.

**Other Recommendations by the Panel:**

- Introduction of the **“Design Your Degree” programme** (adopted in Jammu University) in Higher Education Institutions for **Personalized, Interdisciplinary Learning**.
- **Develop and distribute educational content tailored** to local needs and languages.
- **Research and innovation** in the field of education for marginalized communities.

**Provisions of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 for higher education:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Provisions**|**Description**|
|**Increase GER to 50% by 2035**|NEP 2020 aims to increase the [**Gross Enrolment Ratio**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/tag/gross-enrolment-ratio/) **(GER)** in higher education, including vocational education, from about 26% (2018) to 50% by 2035|
|**Holistic Multidisciplinary Education**|The policy envisions **broad-based, multi-disciplinary, holistic undergraduate (UG) education** with flexible curricula.|
|It promotes **creative combinations of subjects**, integration of vocational education, and introduces multiple entry and exit points with appropriate certification.|
|UG education can **be 3 or 4 years** with various exit options and certifications at different stages.|
|**By 2025, at least 50% of learners** through school and higher education systems shall have exposure to **vocational education**|
|**Regulation**|The [**Higher Education Commission of India**](http://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Higher-Education-Commission-of-India-HECI.pdf) **(HECI)** will be established as a single **overarching umbrella body** for the entire higher education system, excluding medical and legal education.|
|**HECI will consist of four independent verticals**:|National Higher Education Regulatory Council (NHERC) for regulation|
|General Education Council (GEC) for standard setting|
|Higher Education Grants Council (HEGC) for funding|
|National Accreditation Council (NAC) for accreditation|
|**Both public and private HEIs** will adhere to the same set of norms for regulation, accreditation, and academic standards.|

#### **GS Paper 4**

 **Syllabus: Application of Ethics: Media**

**Source:** [**The Print**](https://theprint.in/national-interest/opposition-can-choose-to-boycott-tv-anchors-but-a-list-paints-a-target-on-journalists-backs/1764216/)**,**

 **Example 1**: **Boycott of Journalists**

India’s Opposition parties have decided to **boycott 14 prominent news anchors** accused of “**partisanship and hate-mongering**.”

**Ethical issues concerned with such a boycott:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Ethical Issue**|**Description**|
|**Targeting Individuals**|Naming and boycotting specific news anchors can be seen as a form of **personal targeting** rather than addressing broader systemic issues in journalism (such as quality and credibility of journalism)|
|**Lack of Due Process**|Boycotting anchors **without a transparent and fair due process** raises questions about fairness, justice, and the right to defend oneself against allegations.|
|**Freedom of Expression**|Limiting access to news anchors may be perceived as a **restriction on freedom of expression,** both for the anchors themselves and for those who wish to hear their perspectives.|
|**Impact on Media Landscape**|**Over-personalization of journalism** and targeting specific anchors|
|**Transparency and Accountability**|The process of determining **which anchors to boycott**, and the criteria used, should be transparent and accountable to avoid favouritism or bias.|

**Suggestion**: Instead of targeting specific anchors, the focus should be on addressing hate and bias in journalism through public and political debate.

**Example 2: Rupert Murdoch and trust deficit in media**

**Context:** Rupert Murdoch, creator of Fox News, steps down as head of News Corp. and Fox Corp

Rupert Murdoch led to a **trust deficit in media primarily** revolving around his media empire’s practices and **their impact on journalism** and public perception.

**Key issues are:**

- **Phone-Hacking Scandal:** Journalists at **Murdoch’s News of the World tabloid** had illegally hacked into the **phones of various individuals**, including celebrities and crime victims, to gather stories.
    - This **unethical and invasive practice** not only violated privacy but also undermined trust in the media as a whole.
- **Ethical Breaches**: Murdoch’s media outlets faced allegations of ethical breaches, such as **biased reporting and sensationalism**.
    - **Ethical issues of prioritizing profit and sensationalism over responsible journalism**, erode the public’s trust in the credibility of news reporting.
- **Influence on Editorial Independence**: There were allegations that editors and journalists working for Murdoch’s companies were pressured to align their reporting with his political and business interests.
- **Monopoly Concerns:** Murdoch’s media holdings included a vast array of newspapers, television networks, and other media platforms. Some argued that this media monopoly allowed him to **control a significant portion of the news landscape**, limiting diversity of perspectives and potentially **skewing public discourse**.

**Mains Links:**

**Today we find that in spite of various measures like prescribing codes of conduct, setting up vigilance cells/commissions, RTI, active media, and strengthening legal mechanisms, corrupt practices are not coming under control. (UPSC 2015)**

**(a) Evaluate the effectiveness of these measures with justifications.**

**(b) Suggest more effective strategies to tackle this menace.**

#### **Content for Mains Enrichment**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/a-vaccine-wheel-in-uttar-pradesh-helps-asha-workers-track-newborn-immunisation/article67339245.ece)

 **Context:** In Uttar Pradesh, the **introduction of an** [**immunization**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/10/mission-indradhanush-2/) **wheel** has significantly improved the **efficiency of accredited social health activist (ASHA) workers,** contributing to a high rate of vaccine coverage for newborns.

**What is the Immunization Wheel?**

The Immunization Wheel is a simple tool consisting of two discs, one with **vaccine details and the other with a calendar**. Health workers use it to **calculate vaccination dates** for newborns, making the process more efficient and accurate.

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/baby_1.jpg)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/baby_1.jpg)

**Funded by the Clinton Foundation**, the Immunization Wheel simplifies vaccination date calculations. [ASHA workers](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/05/24/asha-workers-honoured-by-who/) use it to **link a child’s birthdate to vaccines**, automatically providing dates for the remaining dates for the first year of life.

**Success**: This tool has boosted **vaccine coverage to 95% in the first year** and improved parent communication, enhancing immunization success in Uttar Pradesh.

**Usage:** The example can used as a way forward in Health related questions.
