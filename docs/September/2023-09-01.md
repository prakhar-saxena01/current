 **Context:** [UNESCO World Heritage sites](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/02/unesco-heritage-danger-list/), home to a significant portion of global biodiversity, **including iconic species like elephants, tigers, and pandas**, are under threat from climate change and human activities.

- The sites make up **only 1% of Earth’s surface** but play a critical role in preserving biodiversity and addressing climate disruption

**What are** [**World Heritage sites**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/05/27/unesco-world-heritage-sites/)**?**

World Heritage sites are **landmarks or areas of cultural, historical, scientific, or natural significance** that are recognized and designated by the **United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).** These sites are considered to be of outstanding value to humanity, and their preservation is of global importance.

**There are two main types of World Heritage sites:**

- **Cultural Heritage Sites**: These include historical buildings, cities, monuments, archaeological sites, and cultural landscapes that hold cultural and historical significance.
    - Examples include the Pyramids of Egypt, the Historic Centre of Rome, and the Great Wall of China.
- [**Natural Heritage Sites**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-heritage-culture/promotion-and-preservation-of-indian-heritage/natural-heritage-sites/)**:** These encompass natural areas, ecosystems, and geological formations that are of exceptional natural beauty or scientific importance.
    - Examples include the **Galápagos Islands,** the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, and Yellowstone National Park in the United States.

**Significance of World Heritage sites:** They are protected and preserved to ensure that they are **passed down to future generations**.

**Protecting World Heritage sites will lead to Biodiversity Conservation:**

|   |   |

### [Understanding curbs on rice exports](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/09/01/understanding-curbs-on-rice-exports/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus: Agriculture**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/explained-understanding-curbs-on-rice-exports/article67253191.ece)

 **Context:** The Indian government has implemented several measures to [regulate rice exports](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/28/indias-rice-export-ban/) and ensure domestic food security, including a **20% export duty on par-boiled rice** until October 15 and restrictions on **white rice exports**.

**Status of Rice production and export:**

- India is the **second-largest producer of rice**in the world, after China.
- India is the **world’s largest exporter of rice**, with a **45% share**.
- **Non-Basmati rice exports** have been on a consistent upward trend over the past three years.
- **Decreased production**: The latest rice production estimate in India for the Rabi season 2022-2023 indicates a decrease of about 14% compared to the previous year.
- The government has increased the **Minimum Support Price (MSP)** for rice.

**Recent government restrictions on Rice exports:**

- In May 2022, the government **banned wheat exports**.
- In June 2023, restrictions on **stock holdings were imposed**.
- In September 2022, the [**export of broken rice was prohibited**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/28/indias-rice-export-ban/), and a 20% tariff was imposed on non-parboiled white grain shipments.
- In July 2023, **non-basmati white rice exports were entirely prohibited**, with only parboiled non-basmati and basmati rice allowed.
- Recently, **a 20% duty was introduced on all parboiled non-basmati rice exports**.

**Why is the Indian government imposing restrictions on rice and wheat exports?** 

- **Enhancing Domestic Supply**: The government’s goal is to reduce exports to ensure an adequate supply of grains within the country.
    - There are concerns about depleting rice stocks, especially in light of the free-foodgrains scheme’s continuation pressure (**Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana)**
- **Impact of** [**monsoon/El Nino**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/30/will-the-indian-ocean-dipole-save-the-monsoon/#:~:text=El%20Nino%20can%20lead%20to,La%20Nina%20can%20enhance%20it.&text=It%20is%20considered%20to%20have,was%20the%202005%20El%20Nino.&text=It%20is%20the%20east%2Dwest,It%20also%20influences%20the%20monsoon.)**:** It includes potential declines in rice production in several Indian states. El Nino may affect new crop arrivals.
- **Tackling Inflation**: Retail food inflation was at **1.****5% in July**, and the government is taking measures to control rising food prices.
- **Preventing Illicit Exports**: The minimum export price rule is meant to prevent illegal exports of **non-basmati white rice** from being misrepresented as basmati rice.

**The government’s initiative to limit rice and wheat exports faces several issues:**

- **Enforcement Challenges**: Export limitations can be bypassed through inaccurate classification. White non-basmati rice has been exported using codes intended for parboiled and basmati rice.
- **Excessively High Minimum Export Price**: The **$1,200 Minimum Export Price** is considered too high. Only specific rice varieties achieve these prices, accounting for just around 15% of basmati exports.
- **Impact on the earnings of farmers**

**Suggestions and the way ahead include:**

- **Consider classifying rice for export policy decisions** as common and speciality rice, rather than **just as Basmati and non-Basmati.**
- **Protect varieties of rice with** [**Geographical Indication (GI) recognition**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/28/geographical-indication-tags/#:~:text=A%20GI%20is%20primarily%20an,the%20place%20of%20its%20origin.) from general market interventions.
- **For Basmati rice, permit exports to continue or set a minimum export value, such as $900 per tonne**, as new crop arrivals are expected to meet demand due to good quality and consistent supply.

**Conclusion**

Government’s actions **aim to strike a balance between safeguarding domestic interests** and maintaining a competitive presence in the global rice market. The situation will become clearer by mid-September, as factors like crop arrivals and government policies evolve.

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus: Disaster Management**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/are-natural-disasters-man-made/article67255463.ece#:~:text=Not%20fully%2C%20but%20we%20have,climate%20change%20as%20a%20catalyst.)

**Context:** The article discusses the impact of human actions on natural disasters, particularly in the context of **increasing incidents during the** [**monsoon season in India**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-geography-2/indian-climate/indian-monsoon/characteristics-of-monsoonal-rainfall/#:~:text=Rainfall%20received%20from%20the%20southwest,governed%20by%20relief%20or%20topography.).

**What are** [**natural disasters**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/natural-disaster-management-in-india.pdf)**?**

A natural disaster is a **catastrophic event that is caused by the forces of nature**. Examples of natural disasters include earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, and wildfires. E.g, The **2020 Haiti earthquake**, a recent landslide in Himachal Pradesh.

**Although natural disasters are natural, many natural disasters are exacerbated by poor planning and human activities:**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Natural Disaster**|**Human Influence/Contribution**|**Examples**|
|**Flooding**|Deforestation, urbanization,|Flooding in urban areas due to|
||improper land use, drainage issues|inadequate drainage systems (e.g., Mumbai floods).|
||||
|**Wildfires**|Forest mismanagement, arson, climate change|California wildfires are caused by human activity and dry conditions.|
||||
|**Landslides**|Deforestation, construction on slopes, heavy rainfall|Landslides in hilly regions due to deforestation and improper land use.|
||||
|**Drought**|Over-extraction of water resources, climate change|Prolonged droughts in regions with excessive water use (e.g., California).|
||||
|**Hurricanes/Cyclones**|Climate change, sea-level rise, inadequate infrastructure|More intense hurricanes due to global warming and poor coastal planning.|
||||
|**Earthquakes**|Induced seismicity from activities like hydraulic fracturing (fracking)|Earthquakes triggered by hydraulic fracturing (fracking) operations.|
||||
|**Tsunamis**|Underwater explosions, coastal engineering|Tsunamis caused by underwater nuclear tests or improper coastal engineering.|
||||
|**Volcanic Eruptions**|Human activity near active volcanoes|Volcanic eruptions are exacerbated by settlements near active volcanic zones.|

**Urbanization, increased population density, and unsustainable development practices pose significant challenges for disaster management in the country:**

- **Infrastructure Strain:** Rapid urbanization often leads to inadequate infrastructure such as roads, water supply, and sewage systems, causing congestion and public health issues.
- **Environmental Degradation:** Unsustainable development harms ecosystems, leading to deforestation, pollution, and loss of biodiversity.
- **Natural Disaster Vulnerability**: Rapid urban growth in hazard-prone areas can increase vulnerability to natural disasters like floods and earthquakes.
