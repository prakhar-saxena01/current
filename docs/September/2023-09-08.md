### [End of old multilateralism – and the beginning of a new order](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/09/08/end-of-old-multilateralism-and-the-beginning-of-a-new-order/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: International Relations**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/east-asia-summit-absence-of-russian-president-vladimir-putin-chinese-president-xi-jinping-asian-neighbours-8926273/)

 **Context:** The article discusses the **declining state of post-**[**Cold War**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/world-history/cold-war/) **multilateralism** at both global and regional levels, particularly due to **conflicts involving Russia and China**.

**What is** [**Multilateralism**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/06/g20-meeting-shows-a-deepening-crisis-in-multilateralism/)**?** 

**It** refers to the practice of **multiple countries coming together and collaborating on global issues, challenges, and decision-making.** It involves engaging in **dialogue, negotiation, and cooperation** through **international organizations, treaties, and fora** to address common problems and pursue collective goals.

Some of the multilateral fora that India is engaged in are- **The United Nations, SCO, BRICS**, etc.

**The weakening of ‘Old Multilateralism’ in the post-Cold War era can be attributed to several factors:**

- [**Russian Conflicts**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/02/16/russia-ukraine-crisis/)**:** Russia’s aggressive actions, such as the annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea in 2014 and the ongoing conflict with Ukraine, have strained international relations and created divisions.
- **China’s Territorial Ambitions**: China’s territorial disputes with neighbouring Asian countries, including India, Japan, the Philippines, and Vietnam, have raised concerns and contributed to regional tensions.
- **Economic Leverage:** China’s use of its economic power for political and strategic gains has eroded trust among nations that depend on its economy, leading to scepticism and caution.
- **Change in Chinese Policies**: China’s shift in policies under Xi Jinping, departing from the peaceful periphery and shared prosperity approach of the 1980s, has disrupted regional and global institutions, impacting stability and cooperation.

**Need for ‘New’ Multilateralism:**

### [Use financial inclusion to reduce inequality and speed up growth](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/09/08/use-financial-inclusion-to-reduce-inequality-and-speed-up-growth/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus: Inclusive growth**

**Source:** [**LM**](https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/use-financial-inclusion-to-reduce-inequality-and-speed-up-growth-11693926740685.html)

 **Context**: The article discusses financial inclusion as a tool for reducing inequality and fostering economic growth.

**What is** [**financial inclusion**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/07/16/financial-inclusion/)**?**

It means ensuring that all **individuals and businesses have access to affordable and essential financial services**, such as banking, credit, savings, and insurance, regardless of their income or location. It aims to promote economic stability, reduce poverty, and empower marginalized populations by providing them with the tools to manage their finances and participate in the formal economy.

**Importance of Financial Inclusion:**

- Financial inclusion is essential for reducing poverty and inequality.
- It helps strengthen the livelihoods of those at the bottom of the economic pyramid.
- It contributes to global economic growth.

**Challenges in Promoting** [**Financial Inclusion**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/07/16/financial-inclusion/) **(globally):**

- **Limited Access**: Around 24% of adults worldwide lack access to formal financial accounts, hindering their participation in the financial system.
- **Low Savings and Borrowing Rates:** Only 29% of adults deposit their savings in financial institutions and just 28% borrow from formal financial institutions on a global scale.
- **MSME Financing Disparities**: Micro-enterprises in developing countries face constraints due to loan application rejections or unfavourable terms (21%), while small and medium-sized enterprises experience even higher barriers (30%).
- [**Gender Disparities**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/23/global-gender-gap-report-2023/): Women encounter obstacles such as restrictive social norms, limited mobility, and low financial literacy, leading to a gender gap in bank account ownership, especially in low-income and developing countries.
- **Limited Digital Payment Adoption**: Men with accounts are more likely to use digital payment methods (6 percentage points higher) in developing nations, further excluding women from digital financial services.
- **Emergency Funds Access**: Women in developing nations find it more challenging to access emergency funds, with only 50% claiming consistent access compared to 59% of men.

**The Way Forward for Financial Inclusion:**

- **Pillar 1: Strengthening the Ecosystem:**
    - Promote private sector involvement through partnerships.
    - Enhance financial literacy and capacity-building programs.
    - Promote gender-inclusive financial services.
- **Pillar 2: Expanding Financial Services:**
    - Increase insurance penetration beyond 7% of GDP.
    - Accelerate financial inclusion for agricultural, rural, and migrant populations.
    - Reduce the cost of capital for financial institutions.
    - Innovate distribution channels and standardize cross-border payments.
- **Pillar 3: Consumer Protection:**
    - Formulate policies that balance consumer protection and innovation.
    - Uphold consumer trust in new digital products and services.

**India’s Case Study with** [**Banking Correspondents**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/04/14/business-correspondents/)**/ Business Correspondents (BCs)**

 **BCs are agents who work on behalf of banks** and other financial institutions to provide banking services to underserved communities, including rural areas, where traditional bank branches are often scarce.

- **Origins**: BCs are often members of the local community and are seen as trustworthy and reliable by their customers.

**Role in financial inclusion:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Role**|**Description**|
|**Last Mile Connectivity**|BCs provide crucial last-mile connectivity, bridging the gap to underserved rural communities.|
|**Liaisons**|They act as **intermediaries between banks and customers**, offering banking services to those distant from traditional bank branches.|
|**Trust Building**|BCs help build **trust and confidence among customers** from target communities, making formal banking services more accessible and acceptable.|
|**Customized Services**|They offer **tailored services to meet customers’ specific needs**, such as account opening, cash deposit/withdrawal, and other banking services, enhancing convenience.|
|**Increased Financial Literacy**|BCs contribute to **improving financial literacy,** especially among women, by providing guidance on using formal banking services.|
|**Cost-effective**|BCs reduce **operational costs for banks and financial institutions** compared to setting up full-fledged branches.|
|**SHG Synergies**|**Women from Self-Help Groups (SHGs)** serving as Business Correspondents (**BC Sakhis) and Bank Sakhis** have played essential roles, including disbursing funds during the COVID-19 lockdown.|

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/forest-conservation-amendment-act-threat-northeast-states/article67268866.ece)

 **Context:** This article discusses the [**Forest (Conservation) Amendment Act, 2023**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/22/the-forest-conservation-amendment-bill-2023/#:~:text=The%20amendments%20will%20%E2%80%93,through%20ecologically%20balanced%20sustainable%20development.), which allows **forest land diversion** for certain projects near India’s borders.

**More about the article:**

- The article highlights **opposition from states in India’s Northeast** due to concerns about its impact on tribal and customary laws.
- **Recently, the Mizoram Assembly** has passed a resolution **opposing the** [**2023 Forest (Conservation) Amendment Act**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/22/the-forest-conservation-amendment-bill-2023/#:~:text=The%20amendments%20will%20%E2%80%93,through%20ecologically%20balanced%20sustainable%20development.), citing ongoing forest conservation and tribal rights challenges in Northeast India.
- **Tripura have passed similar resolutions** opposing the amendment
- **Nagaland faces similar demands**
- **Sikkim also opposes** the 100 km exemption clause.

**Key provisions of** [**Forest (Conservation) Amendment Act, 2023**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/22/the-forest-conservation-amendment-bill-2023/#:~:text=The%20amendments%20will%20%E2%80%93,through%20ecologically%20balanced%20sustainable%20development.)**:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Aspect**|**Details**|
|**About**|Forest (Conservation) Amendment Bill, 2023 allows for the diversion of forest land for various projects, including **roads, railways, and strategic national security projects**, within 100 km of India’s international borders. It amends the [Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980.](https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/environment-degradation-and-issues/forest-ecosystem/forest-policy-and-laws-for-forest-conservation/the-forest-conservation-act-1980/#:~:text=Enacted%20to%20check%20the%20indiscriminate,prescribing%20the%20punishment%20for%20violations.&text=Working%20plans%20should%20be%20up,have%20a%20multi%2Ddimensional%20approach.)|
|**Objective**|To clarify and enhance the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980|
|**Scope**|Applicability to land designated as **forest since 1980**|
|**Exemptions**|·        **Land within 100 km of borders** for national security<br><br>·        **Forest land along a rail line** or a public road maintained by the government<br><br>·        **Land up to 10 hectares**, proposed to be used for constructing security-related infrastructure, etc.|
|**Assignment of Forest Land**|Prior approval is required from the central government for all entities|
|**Permitted Activities**|Expanded to include check posts, fencing, bridges, zoos and safaris under the [**Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/09/wildlife-protection-amendment-bill-2022/); eco-tourism facilities; and silvicultural operations (enhancing forest growth), etc.|

**Concerns raised by Northeast states against the amendment:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Concerns Raised**|**Amendment’s Impact on Northeast India**|
|**Forest land diversion near borders**|The amendment **allows forest land diversion within 100 km of India’s borders** without forest clearance, affecting the environment and tribal rights in Northeast India.|
|**Forests not officially classified**|Areas not officially classified as forests in government records, even if they are **standing forests**, won’t be protected from commercial exploitation or diversion.|
|||
|**Significant unclassed forest areas**|A substantial portion of **North-eastern forests is privately owned, including unclassed forests,** which may not be covered by the Act unless included in government records.|

**Central Government’s argument:**

**The predominant idea of the proposed changes:**

- **To build forest carbon stock**by raising plantations.
- **To make land available** for developers to meet their legal obligation towards [**compensatory afforestation**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/06/unused-funds-unsuitable-land-the-problems-with-compensatory-afforestation-in-india/)in lieu of forest land diverted for development projects.
- Freeing up land that is currently locked up as **unrecorded forests.**

**Mechanisms for Forest Protection in North East India:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Mechanisms**|**Details**|
|**Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act (FRA) 2006**|·        Recognizes **various types of forest land**, including unclassified forests, providing protection to tribal communities<br><br>·        Aligned with the 1996 Supreme Court redefinition of **“forest land.”**|
|[**Article 371A and 371G**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/08/07/article-371-of-the-constitution/)|·        Special Constitutional protections in **Article 371A (Nagaland) and 371G (Mizoram)** safeguard tribal customary law, land ownership, and transfer rights.<br><br>·        **Mizoram**, being a State, falls under FCA’s purview, affecting over 84% of its forest areas.|
|**Forest Rights Act (FRA) 2006**|·        Recognizes **traditional forest rights**, including unclassed forests, offering additional protection to tribal communities<br><br>·        However, **most North-eastern states**, except Assam and Tripura, have **not implemented FRA** due to land ownership patterns and a lack of forest-dependent communities.|

**Conclusion:** 

Forests are a lot more than a sum of trees. Unlike man-made plantations, natural forests perform a range of ecosystem services that are key to the survival and well-being of millions of species.

- This magnificent statue made of **‘Ashtadhatu’ (eight-metal alloy)** was crafted by **sculptors from Swamimalai in Tamil Nadu, India,** and is inspired by **three revered Nataraja idols from** [**Chola temples**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-heritage-culture/sculpture/medieval-school-of-sculpture/cholas-sculpture/)**.**

**About Nataraja form of Shiva:** 

- The Nataraja form of Shiva, as a cosmic dancer, **became iconic under the Cholas and is renowned for its intricate bronze sculptures.**
- In this form, Lord Shiva is depicted as **the ‘Lord of Dance’ or Nataraja**, embodying **both creative and destructive forces.**
- The Nataraja image is encircled by a **flaming halo and has four arms**. He **holds a drum and fire in his upper hands, symbolizing creation and destruction**. Under his foot, there’s a **dwarf-like figure representing illusion**, which he crushes, **guiding humanity away from delusion**.
- Nataraja’s raised feet and gestures also **symbolize protection and reassurance**, all while he wears a **smiling expression.**

[**Lost Wax Technique**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/22/mission-2023-insights-daily-current-affairs-pib-summary-22-december-2022/)**:**

- The sculpture was crafted using the traditional **‘lost-wax’ casting method**, a technique that dates back thousands of years and was perfected by the Cholas.
- In this method, **a detailed wax model is covered with alluvial soil**, which, when **heated, melts the wax away, leaving a hollow mould for casting molten metal**.

### [Human embryo](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/09/08/human-embryo/)

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/without-sperm-or-egg-how-scientists-grew-whole-model-of-human-embryo-8929693/)

 **Context:** Scientists have managed to [**grow a human embryo-like structure**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/17/lab-grown-human-embryo-models/) in a laboratory **without using traditional sperm or eggs**.

- This remarkable achievement involved using a **combination of stem cells, which can differentiate into various cell types**, and **chemicals to create an embryo-like structure that mimics** the molecular characteristics of an early human embryo.
- The process involved **a mixture of stem cells and chemicals**, with **only 1% of the mixture spontaneously forming different types of cells needed for foetal development**, including those providing nutrients, those guiding body development, and cells responsible for structures like the placenta and umbilical cord.

**Importance:**

- The significance of this research lies in the fact that **ethical constraints make it challenging for scientists to study the early stages of embryo development after implantation in the uterus**. These early stages are crucial because **most miscarriages and birth defects occur during this period**.
- These **lab-grown embryo-like models cannot be used for pregnancy**, and they are typically destroyed after 14 days of study, in line with legal and ethical regulations in many countries. The **14-day limit on embryo research corresponds to the point when embryos naturally complete implantation and become individuals.**
- These models have allowed scientists to **investigate genetic and environmental effects on embryo development, shedding light on genetic defects and potential treatments** for various conditions.

### [‘Atlantification’ of the Arctic Ocean](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/09/08/atlantification-of-the-arctic-ocean/)

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**The Print**](https://theprint.in/science/new-study-explains-atlantification-of-the-arctic-ocean/1747716/#google_vignette)

 **Context:** A recent study has **identified the cause of the decline in Arctic Ocean Sea ice since 2007.** Researchers found that the periodic reversal of an atmospheric phenomenon known **as the Arctic dipole plays a significant role in driving drops in sea ice.**

- The study, published in the journal Science, explores the ecosystem **responses to the Arctic dipole and its impact on the Arctic Ocean climate, a phenomenon referred to as Atlantification.**
- The Arctic dipole follows a **roughly 15-year cycle**, and data spanning several decades suggest that it **is approaching the end of its current regime**.
- The current **“positive” phase of the Arctic dipole, which has been in place since 2007, involves high pressure over the Canadian Arctic and low pressure over the Siberian Arctic.**
- This wind pattern drives upper ocean currents and has year-round impacts on **air temperatures, heat exchanges, sea-ice drift, and ecological consequences.**

**Significance:**

- The study highlights the importance **of water exchanges between the Nordic seas and the Arctic Ocean for the Arctic climate system**, with sea ice decline serving as a significant indicator of climate change.
- Researchers observed changes in Atlantic water flow into the Arctic Ocean, including decreased flow through the **Fram Strait** and **increased flow into the Barents Sea**, which they referred to as a **“switchgear mechanism” driven by the Arctic dipole.**
- This change in water flow has **had a significant impact on sea ice loss, slowing it down from 2007 to 2021**.
- The study also notes that these changes in **water inflow have profound effects on marine life, creating more favourable conditions for sub-Arctic boreal species in certain areas.**

India is planning to build a **large barrage on the** [**Siang River**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2017/11/30/insights-daily-current-affairs-30-november-2017/siang-river/) to protect it from a Chinese dam being built in Tibet. The dam is being built on the **Yarlung Tsangpo River in** [**Tibet’s**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/09/02/tibetan-democracy-day-2/) **Medog district**.

Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Pema Khandu warned that if India does not respond to the dam, his state and neighbouring Assam could face environmental disasters, including floods.

**What is a barrage?** 

**A barrage is a dam** or barrier built across a river or watercourse to control the flow of water. It typically **consists of gates or sluices** that can be opened or closed to manage the flow of water downstream.

Barrages are primarily used for **flow control and water diversion**, while **Dams** are designed for **water storage and regulation on a larger scale**.

**Yarlung Tsangpo River (Brahmaputra**) breaks through the Himalayas in great gorges (including the Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon) and enters into Arunachal Pradesh, where it is known as **Dihang or** [**Siang**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2017/11/30/insights-daily-current-affairs-30-november-2017/siang-river/).
