### [Measuring Hunger Across States](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/09/06/measuring-hunger-across-states/)

#### **GS2/GS3 Paper** 

 **Syllabus: Government Policies and Interventions/ Human Resources**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/measuring-hunger-across-states/article67266504.ece)

**Context:** The article discusses the issue of [hunger](https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/issues-related-to-children/malnutrition/#:~:text=Undernourishment%3A%2014%25%20of%20India's%20population,to%20less%20than%2035%25%20now.) and [malnutrition](https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/issues-related-to-children/malnutrition/the-poor-state-of-hunger-and-malnutrition-in-india/) in India and the need for a more localized assessment of this problem.

**What is** [**Hunger**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/issues-related-to-children/malnutrition/#:~:text=Undernourishment%3A%2014%25%20of%20India's%20population,to%20less%20than%2035%25%20now.)**?**

**As per FAO, hunger** is the condition characterized by habitual or chronic consumption of too few calories to meet the minimum dietary energy requirements for a healthy and productive life

**Types of Hunger:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Types**|**Description**|
|**Acute Hunger**|This type of hunger occurs over a defined period and is often associated with **crises like droughts, wars, or other emergencies.** It represents a severe and immediate lack of food.|
|**Chronic Hunger**|Chronic hunger refers to a **long-term state of undernourishment where the body consistently receives less food than it requires**. It is commonly linked to persistent poverty and is a pervasive issue.|
|**Hidden Hunger**|Hidden hunger is a form of **chronic hunger resulting from an imbalanced diet** that lacks essential nutrients such as iron, iodine, zinc, or vitamin A. Even if caloric intake is sufficient, the absence of **critical nutrients can lead to health problems**.|

**What is** [**Malnutrition**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/issues-related-to-children/malnutrition/the-poor-state-of-hunger-and-malnutrition-in-india/)**?**

Malnutrition refers to a **condition where an individual’s diet lacks the necessary nutrients** (such as vitamins, minerals, proteins, and carbohydrates) required for proper growth, development, and overall health. Malnutrition can manifest as

- **Undernutrition** (insufficient intake of nutrients)
- Overnutrition (excessive intake leading to obesity)
- **Specific nutrient deficiencies**

**Status of India on Hunger:**

- **Despite being a major food producer with extensive food** security programs, India faces **significant food insecurity**, hunger, and child malnutrition.
- **In the** [**2022 Global Hunger Index**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/10/15/global-hunger-index-3/#:~:text=Moderate%3A%20The%202022%20GHI%20score,world%20is%20considered%20%E2%80%9Cmoderate%E2%80%9D.&text=India%20on%20the%20index%3A,%2C%20and%20Pakistan%20(99).) **(GHI),** India ranked **107th out of 121** countries, behind Nigeria and Pakistan.
    - **The GHI measures undernourishment and hunger** on a national level, including calorie undernourishment, child malnutrition, and under-five mortality.
    - **Over the past five years,** India’s GHI score has worsened primarily due to the rising prevalence of **calorie undernourishment.**
    - **Child Malnutrition**: India faces significant challenges in child nutrition, with high rates of stunting, underweight children, and wasting
- **The** [**2022 State of Food Security and Nutrition**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/07/08/the-state-of-food-security-and-nutrition-in-the-world-sofi-2022/) **in the World** report revealed that India has over 224 million ( over 22 crore) undernourished individuals, with notable disparities among states.

**About State Hunger Index (SHI):**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Aspects**|**Description**|
|**Index Indicators**|**Global Hunger Index** uses four indicators among children below age 5:<br><br>·        Prevalence of calorie undernourishment<br><br>·        Under-five mortality rate<br><br>·        Stunting<br><br>·        Wasting<br><br>·        Mortality<br><br>State Hunger Index uses the **same indicators, replacing calorie undernourishment with BMI undernourishment** among the working-age population.|
|**Data Sources**|Data for stunting, wasting, and child mortality are from **NFHS-5 (National Family Health Survey 5).** BMI undernourishment data is from **NFHS-5 (2019-21) and Longitudinal Ageing Study in India (2017-18).**|
|**Calculation of SHI**|SHI score is calculated by combining normalized values of four indicators using GHI-recommended techniques. SHI scores range **from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more hunger**.|
|**Performance of States**|·        **Alarming:** Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh scored 35<br><br>·        **Above national average:** Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Tripura, Maharashtra, and West Bengal all scored above the national average of 29<br><br>·        **Moderate hunger:** Chandigarh (12), Sikkim, Puducherry, Kerala (below 16)<br><br>·        **Serious hunger:** States below the national average but above 20. – Low hunger: No state falls under ‘low hunger’ category.|
|**COVID-19 Impact**|The impact of COVID-19 on SHI is not included as post-pandemic estimates are unavailable.|

**Key issues:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Issue**|**Description**|
|**Dispute over data & methodology**|India’s GHI score deteriorated due to **increasing calorie undernourishment.** However, the Indian government disputes the findings and cites concerns about data and methodology.|
|**Lack of** [**National Sample Survey**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/tag/national-sample-survey-office-nsso/) **(NSS) data**|No NSS round on nutritional intake since 2011-12.|
|**Climate change & food insecurity**|Climate change and extreme weather events threaten India’s food system and poverty alleviation efforts. Gains in poverty alleviation could be reversed by these shocks.|
|**Non-communicable diseases**|Rising burden of non-communicable diseases in India, especially among the “**middle class**“. Strongly linked to diet and nutrition.|

**Suggestions for addressing the issues:**

- **India-Specific Hunger Index:** There is a need for an **India-specific hunger index** that evaluates hunger and malnutrition at the state and union territory levels.
    - **This localized assessment** is crucial for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals related to hunger eradication.
- **Prioritize Young Children’s Nutrition:** Elevate the importance of young children’s food intake in policies, beyond just “complementary” nutrition.
- **Improved Assessments:** Adapt the Food and Agriculture Organisation’s household-level food insecurity modules for a better understanding of food security in India.
- **Evidence-Based Policy:** Base policies on measuring the availability, accessibility, and affordability of nutritious food, especially for vulnerable populations.
- [**Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/welfare-schemes/schemes-under-ministry-of-consumer-affairs/pradhan-mantri-gareeb-kalyan-anna-yojana/#:~:text=What%20is%20Pradhan%20Mantri%20Garib,during%20the%20COVID%2D19%20pandemic.)**:** Consider a strategic initiative led by the Prime Minister’s Office to eliminate food insecurity and ensure affordable access to nutritious food, with a focus on young children, to achieve the SDG of zero hunger.

### [Sand Mining: Irreversible damage to Ocean benthic life](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/09/06/sand-mining-irreversible-damage-to-ocean-benthic-life/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus: Environment Conservation**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/environment/6-billion-tonnes-of-sand-taken-annually-from-oceans-causing-irreparable-damage-to-benthic-life-91571)

 **Context:** Approximately **six billion tonnes of sand are extracted** annually from the world’s oceans, causing irreversible damage to benthic life, according to a new global data platform called **Marine Sand Watch**.

**What is** [**Benthic Life**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/world-geography/physical-geography-of-the-world/biogeography/biomes-5/aquatic-zones/)**?**

Benthic life refers to **organisms that live on or near the bottom of aquatic environments**, such as oceans, seas, lakes, and rivers. These organisms are adapted to life on the seabed or riverbed and play crucial roles in the ecosystem, including decomposing organic matter and providing food for other aquatic species.

**Impact of** [**Sand Extraction**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/05/10/unep-report-on-sand-and-sustainability/) **on Benthic Life:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Impact**|**Description**|
|**Disruption of Habitat**|Sand extraction **disturbs the seabed, destroying the habitat and shelter** of benthic organisms such as worms, crustaceans, and small fish.|
|**Sediment Resuspension**|Dredging activities **stir up sediment, increasing water turbidity**. This reduces light penetration, affecting photosynthetic organisms and altering the benthic environment.|
|**Altered Nutrient Dynamics**|**Changes in sediment composition and nutrient** availability can disrupt the food web and nutrient cycling, affecting benthic communities’ survival and reproduction.|
|**Noise Pollution**|The **machinery and vessels used in sand extraction** generate underwater noise, which can disturb and stress benthic organisms, impacting their behaviour and health.|
|**Smothering of Organisms**|**Depositing dredged sand** can smother benthic life and the creatures living within the seabed, preventing them from accessing food and oxygen.|
|**Migration and Displacement**|Benthic organisms may need to **migrate or are forcibly displaced** due to sand extraction, disrupting their natural life cycles and behaviours.|
|**Reduced Food Availability**|Altered sediment composition can reduce the availability of food sources for benthic organisms, leading to reduced populations and potential extinctions.|
|**Increased Mortality**|Sand extraction can directly harm benthic life through physical disturbance and sediment burial, leading to increased mortality rates.|

**Examples of the impact of Coastal Sand Mining on Indian Coasts:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Impacts**|**Description**|
|**Periyasamypuram, Tamil Nadu**|Reduced fish catch – Dried palm trees – Brackish groundwater – Sea intrusion into the village|
|**Kerala (Kollam, Alappuzha, Pathanamthitta, Kottayam, Ernakulam)**|Seawater intrusion – Coastal land inundation – Groundwater salinization due to sand mining|
|**Loss of Turtle Nesting Sites**|Sand mining disrupts turtle nesting habitats, leading to the loss of nesting sites for turtles like Olive Ridley sea turtles.|
|**Karnataka**|Rampant sand mining causing coastal erosion – Government expenditure on erosion control measures|
|**Coastal Ecosystem Impact**|Serious repercussions on the coastal ecosystem – Alarming environmental consequences|
|**Legal Actions**|The [National Green Tribunal](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/11/29/national-green-tribunal-ngt/) imposes a fine of Rs 100 crore on the Andhra Pradesh government for failing to prevent illegal sand mining in the state.|

**Preventive measures taken:**

Some countries — including **Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Cambodia** — have banned marine sand export in the last 20 years, while others lack any legislation and /or effective monitoring programmes.

**Addressing these issues requires a comprehensive approach, including:**

- **Reducing Sand Consumption**: Promoting sand-efficient construction practices.
- **Taxation and Regulation**: Implementing taxes and regulations on sand extraction.
- **Alternative Materials**: Exploring alternatives to sand in construction, such as recycling concrete or using filler materials like construction waste.
- **Community Empowerment**: Involving local communities in decision-making, particularly those downstream or reliant on sand resources.
- **Integrated Regional Management:** Coordinating sand resource management between offshore regulators, coastal communities, and upstream river basins.

**Legal Mechanisms:**

- Sand is categorized as a **“minor mineral”** under the **Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulations) Act, 1957,** and its control lies with the **State Governments**. The primary sources of sand are rivers and coastal areas, and its demand has surged due to **India’s construction and infrastructure development activities**.
- **The Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change** has issued **“Sustainable Sand Mining Management Guidelines 2016**” to promote environmentally friendly sand mining practices.
- **The International Seabed Authority (ISA),** governed by a UN treaty, regulates mineral exploration and extraction. India, as a party to the treaty, has exclusive rights to explore polymetallic nodules in the **Central Indian Ocean Basin** spanning over 75,000 sq. km.

**About Marine Sand Watch**

It is a global data platform developed by GRID-Geneva, part of the UN Environment Programme. It monitors and tracks sediment extraction activities in the world’s marine environments, including sand, clay, silt, gravel, and rock dredging. It uses Automatic Identification System signals from vessels and Artificial Intelligence to identify dredging operations.

### [Threat of Invasive alien species (IAS)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/09/06/threat-of-invasive-alien-species-ias/)

#### **GS Paper 3** 

 **Syllabus: Environment Conservation**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/wildlife-biodiversity/invasive-alien-species-lead-to-extinctions-of-plants-animals-across-earth-ipbes-report-points-out-91548)**,** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/biodiversity-loss-37000-alien-species-introduced-by-human-activities-says-report-8924756/)**,** [**IPEB**](https://www.ipbes.net/IASmediarelease)

**Context**: The latest [Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/07/11/ipbes-assessment-report-on-wild-species/#:~:text=What%20is%20IPBES%3F,and%20sustainable%20use%20of%20biodiversity.&text=Secretariat%3A%20Bonn%2C%20Germany.) report, “Assessment Report on Invasive Alien Species and their Control’’ has said that 37,000 alien species have been introduced by humans, including 3,500 invasive species, are linked to **60% of extinctions of global plant and animals**

**What is an** [**Invasive Alien species**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/04/25/invasive-species-threatens-wildlife-habitats-of-western-ghats/)**?**

Invasive alien species are animals, plants, and microbes introduced by humans to new regions, with negative impacts on nature and often on human quality of life.

- **Examples**: IAS spread diseases like malaria, Zika, and West Nile Fever through **invasive mosquito species**.
- **Water hyacinth in Lake Victoria** has harmed fish populations and livelihoods.

**Key findings of the Report:**

- **There are 37,000 alien species** introduced to various regions and biomes worldwide due to human activities.
    - **Among these, over 3,500 are invasive alien species**, responsible for 60% of global plant and animal extinctions.
- **Invasive alien species are one of the five major drivers of global biodiversity loss**, Other drivers are:-
    - Land and sea use changes
    - Direct exploitation of organisms
    - Climate change
    
- **Alien species increasing**: The number of alien species introduced by humans has been increasing, driven by factors like increased travel, trade, and global economic expansion.
- **Economic Loss**: The annual costs of invasive alien species have quadrupled every decade since 1970, exceeding $423 billion globally in 2019.

**Target 6 of the** [**Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/22/a-new-global-biodiversity-framework/) **Framework aims** to reduce the rate of invasive alien species introduction by at **least 50% by 2030.** While many countries have **targets related to managing invasive species**, only 17% have specific legislation addressing the issue.

**Impact of Invasive Alien Species:**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Impact Category**|**Impact Description**|**Examples**|
|**Biodiversity Loss**|Displacement of native species|European green crab displacing native crabs in North America.|
|Competition with native species|Zebra mussels outcompete native mussels in freshwater ecosystems.|
|Alteration of ecosystems and habitats|Kudzu vine altering forest ecosystems in the southeastern United States.|
|**Human Health**|Spread of diseases|Aedes mosquitoes spread diseases like malaria and Zika.|
|Allergies and health risks|Ragweed causes allergies in humans.|
|**Economic Impact**|Agricultural and crop damage|The brown marmorated stink bug damages fruit crops.|
|Damage to infrastructure and property|Termites cause damage to buildings.|
|**Food Supply**|Impact on fisheries and aquaculture|European shore crab impacting shellfish beds.|
|Crop and livestock damage|Fall armyworms damaging maize crops.|
|**Cultural and Indigenous Impact**|Disruption of cultural practices and traditional knowledge|Invasive species affecting traditional indigenous practices.|
||||
|**Tourism and Recreation**|Impact on tourism and recreational activities|Invasive plants affecting hiking and camping areas.|
|Reduction in aesthetic and scenic values|Invasive species alter natural landscapes.|
|**Economy and Trade**|Trade restrictions and losses|Bans on wood products due to invasive pests.|
|Impact on global trade and commerce|Trade restrictions on invasive species-infested goods.|

**The challenge in controlling Invasive Alien Species:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Challenge**|**Description**|
|**Rapid Spread and Establishment**|Invasive species often spread quickly, making it challenging to contain or eradicate them.<br><br>Lantana Camara invasion threatens **40 per cent of India’s tiger habitat**|
|||
|**Lack of Effective Management Strategies**|Limited resources and knowledge hinder the development and implementation of effective management strategies.|
|||
|||
|**Environmental Impacts**|The use of pesticides to control invasive species can harm non-target species and ecosystems.|
|**Species Diversity**|The dilemma of controlling invasive predators like the mongoose in Hawaii, which was introduced to control rats but also harm native birds.|
|**Globalization and Trade**|Ballast water from ships transporting invasive species to new regions, like zebra mussels in the Great Lakes.|
|**Inadequate Legislation**|Gaps in regulations allow the illegal trade of invasive species as exotic pets.|
|**Climate Change**|Warming temperatures expand the range of invasive plant species into new habitats.|
|Meeting the KMGBF target by 2030 is uncertain. While progress has been made, measures are insufficient. **Only 17% of countries** have specific laws or regulations on IAS, and 45% don’t invest in managing them|   |

**Recommendations**:

- The report suggests an **integrated approach involving various sectors like trade, health, and economic development** to prevent, detect, and respond to biological invasions.
- The urgency to address IAS stems from their role in driving plant and animal extinctions. Awareness and action are essential to mitigate their impact and protect biodiversity.
- **Site-based or ecosystem-based management**, enforce border biosecurity and import controls etc.

**Efforts in this regard:**

- [**Convention on Biological Diversity**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/biodiversity/convention-of-biological-diversity/#:~:text=The%20aim%20of%20the%20convention,and%20their%20habitats%20from%20destruction.) **(CBD)**recognizes that there is an urgent need to address the impact of invasive species.
- [**Aichi Biodiversity Target**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/22/a-new-global-biodiversity-framework/) **9**and one clause of UN Sustainable Development Goal 15 – Life on Land specifically address the issue.
- **The IUCN SSC Invasive Species Specialist Group (ISSG)**aim to reduce threats to ecosystems and their native species by increasing awareness of ways to prevent, control or eradicate IAS.
- **IUCN** has developed knowledge platforms:
- **The Global Invasive Species Database (GISD)** and the Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species (GRIIS).

**About IPBES**

The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (founded 2012; founder: UNEP, UNDP and FAO; secretariat: Bonn, Germany) is an **intergovernmental organization** established to improve the interface **between science and policy** on issues of biodiversity and ecosystem services.

 **Context: T**he French government announced that the **practice of wearing abaya** would be banned in **state-run schools as it violated the principle of Laïcité.**

- **Laïcité, the French principle of** [**secularism**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2014/11/08/secularism-its-meaning-models-and-issues/), involves the complete separation of religious values from the public sphere, **emphasizing the promotion of secular values like liberty, equality, and fraternity.**
- Its aim is to **encourage tolerance and assimilation**, with religion reserved for the private sphere. The state plays **a crucial role in enforcing Laïcité principles**.

**History of Laïcité:**

- **Laïcité emerged following the** [**French Revolution**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/world-history/fresh-revolution/) **in 1789** but became more concrete with the **Law of 1905** during the **Third Republic, establishing state-run secular schools.**
- **Laïcité was not a major issue for much of the 20th century** when France was relatively homogenous. However, **demographic changes in the 1950s and 1960s due to decolonization led to tensions as immigrants from predominantly Muslim countries arrived.**
