### [Additional Points on Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam 2023 (Women Reservation)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/09/23/additional-points-on-nari-shakti-vandan-adhiniyam-2023-women-reservation/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: Reservation**

**Source:** [**TOI**](https://epaper.timesgroup.com/article-share?article=22_09_2023_020_013_cap_TOI)

 **Context:** This is in continuation of the article [published two days back](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/09/21/nari-shakti-vandan-adhiniyam-2023-women-reservation-bill/#:~:text=The%20committee%20recommended%20the%20reservation%20of%20women%20in%20local%20bodies.&text=This%20plan%20also%20recommended%20the%20reservation%20of%20women%20in%20local%20bodies.&text=These%20recommendations%20led%20to%20the,for%20women%20in%20local%20bodies.). The author (**Surjit Bhalla** (an Indian economist, author and columnist) suggests further reforms to make women’s reservations meaningful.

**Suggestions to further improve the women’s reservation in India:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Recommendation**|**Description**|
|**Quotas for Political Parties**|Every political party **should nominate 33% or 50% women candidates** for all types of elections, from local to national levels.|
|Countries like Rwanda, Norway, South Africa and Sweden have successfully implemented such quotas.|
|**Dual Member Constituencies**|Dual member constituencies where some constituencies shall have two candidates, one being a woman|
|In the past, **India had multi-member constituencies** with SC/ST representation. In 1961, **these constituencies were changed to single-member ones** due to their large size, and this change was seen as a way to increase the significance of SC/ST members in reserved constituencies.|

**Analysis of  Reservation in Political Parties:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Advantages**|**Disadvantages**|
|Provide more democratic choices to voters|No guarantee that a significant number of women will get elected|
|Allow more flexibility for parties in candidate selection|Political parties may assign women candidates to weak constituencies|
|Can promote women from minority communities strategically|Might lead to resentment if women are chosen over stronger male candidates|

**Advantages of Dual-Member Constituencies:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Advantages**|**Disadvantages**|
|Does not decrease the democratic choice for voters|Sitting members may have to share their political base|
|Does not discriminate against male candidates|Women may become **secondary or add-on** representatives|
|Easier for members to manage smaller constituencies|To achieve 33% women representation, half of the seats must be dual constituencies, increasing the total number of MPs by 50% and potentially **complicating deliberations in Parliament.**|

**Additional Information:**

**Comparison of the key changes between the 2008 Bill and the Bill introduced in 2023:**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Aspect**|**2008 Bill**|**2023 Bill**|
|**Reservation in Lok Sabha**|One-third of Lok Sabha seats in each state/UT to be reserved for women|One-third of seats to be reserved for women|
|**Rotation of Seats**|Reserved seats are to be rotated after every general election to Parliament/legislative assembly|Reserved seats are to be rotated after every delimitation exercise|
|**Anglo-Indians**|Reservation for SC/ST and Anglo Indian|Reservation for only SC and ST (not Anglo Indians)|

**Errata**: In the Infographic for **Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam 2023 (released previously and not corrected), it was mentioned that “The Bill provide sub reservation for SC, ST and ANGLO INDIANS among women candidates”.**

 **However, in the new version of the bill, the reservation for the ANGLO INDIANS has been dropped.**

In January 2020, the **Anglo-Indian reserved seats in the Parliament and State Legislatures** of India were abolished by the **104th Constitutional Amendment Act, 2019**.

### [Immunity of legislators from bribery charges](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/09/23/immunity-of-legislators-from-bribery-charges/)

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/immunity-to-legislators-on-bribery-sc-to-revisit-order-8949224/)

 **Context:** The **Supreme Court of India** has decided **to revisit its 1998 Constitution Bench judgment** in the **P V Narasimha Rao case**, which granted [**legislators immunity from criminal prosecution**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/07/29/privileges-and-immunity-no-shield-for-criminal-acts-in-house-says-supreme-court/#:~:text=Legislators%20cannot%20unleash%20violence%2C%20run,office%20in%20the%20Legislative%20Assembly.) **on bribery charges for their speeches or votes in Parliament.**

- **A 5-judge Constitution Bench, headed by Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud, has referred the matter to a larger 7-judge Bench**. This decision aims to reconsider the **interpretation of Articles 105(2) and 194(2) of the Constitution**, which extend **this privilege to members of Parliament and State Legislatures, respectively.**

**Background of the case:**

- The **P V Narasimha Rao case originated from the 1993 JMM bribery case**, where some members of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) party were accused of accepting bribes to vote against a no-confidence motion against the government led by P V Narasimha Rao. The **Supreme Court had granted them immunity under Article 105(2) in that case.**

**Recent Issue:**

- The recent revisit decision came up in a **case involving bribery charges against JMM MLA Sita Soren, who was accused of accepting a bribe to vote for an independent candidate in the 2012 Rajya Sabha elections**. The High Court of Jharkhand had rejected her plea to quash the charges based on Article 194(2). The matter **reached the Supreme Court, where it was referred to a larger Bench due to its substantial public importance.**

The 5-judge Bench, in its decision to refer the case, noted that the issue concerns the essence of parliamentary democracy and the freedom of legislators to speak and vote without fear of criminal consequences. The Court emphasized that the **purpose of Articles 105(2) and 194(2) is to enable legislators to carry out their duties without fear, rather than granting them higher privileges and immunity from general criminal laws.**
