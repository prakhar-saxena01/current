### [Reasons behind Morocco’s earthquake](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/09/13/reasons-behind-moroccos-earthquake/)

#### **GS Paper 1**

 **Syllabus: Geography: Geomorphology**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/what-caused-moroccos-earthquake-a-geologist-studying-the-atlas-mountains-explains/article67298571.ece#:~:text=The%20earthquake%20resulted%20from%20a,characteristic%20of%20a%20seismic%20fault.)**,** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/earthquake-morocco-8932001/)

 **Context:** A powerful [earthquake](https://www.insightsonindia.com/world-geography/physical-geography-of-the-world/geomorphology/internal-forces-their-impact/earthquakes/) with **a magnitude of 6.8 struck Morocco**, causing extensive damage and a death toll exceeding 2,400 people. The earthquake’s epicentre was in the **Atlas** **Mountains near Marrakech**.

**Reason for the** [**Earthquake**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/world-geography/physical-geography-of-the-world/geomorphology/internal-forces-their-impact/earthquakes/)**:**

The earthquake in Morocco resulted from a **geological phenomenon known as a “reverse fault.”** 

- **Tectonic Plate Interaction**: Morocco is situated in an area **where the Eurasian and African tectonic plates converge**.
- **Plate Boundary Activity:** The Atlas Mountains, where the earthquake occurred, are actively rising due to the convergence of these two large tectonic plates
- **Seismic Stress Accumulation**: Although the region had not experienced major recorded earthquakes before, stress had been accumulating underground for an extended period due to the slow movement of tectonic plates.
- **Oblique-Reverse Fault**: This type of faulting is common in **areas of compression** along the convergent plate boundaries. The stress along these fault lines can induce earthquakes as rocks **abruptly shift to release accumulated stress**.

**More about** **Oblique-Reverse Fault:** 

An oblique-reverse fault is a geological fault characterized by **both horizontal and vertical movements along the fault plane**. In this type of fault, rocks on one side of the fault plane move vertically upward while also sliding horizontally in a lateral direction. This movement occurs due to the **compression of tectonic plates**, where one plate is converging into another.

**Various** [**types of faults**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/world-geography/physical-geography-of-the-world/geomorphology/faulting/fault-styles-types/)**:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Type of Fault**|**Description**|
|**Dip-Slip Faults**<br><br>[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Dip_slip.jpg)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Dip_slip.jpg)|Movement along the direction of the dip plane.|
|Vertical movement either up (reverse dip-slip) or down (normal dip-slip) along the fault plane.|
|Common in regions experiencing crustal compression or extension.|
|Examples: **Reverse faults** (upthrown block above the fault plane) and **Normal faults** (downthrown block above the fault plane).|
|**Strike-Slip Faults**<br><br>[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/stike_slip.jpg)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/stike_slip.jpg)|Horizontal movement along the fault plane.|
|Movement is parallel to the strike of the fault.|
|Common in **transform plate boundaries** where tectonic plates slide past each other horizontally.|
|**Oblique-Slip Faults**<br><br>[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/slip.jpg)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/slip.jpg)|Show characteristics of **both dip-slip and strike-slip faults.**|
|**Movement occurs in two directions:** horizontal (strike-slip) and vertical (dip-slip) along the fault plane.|

**Why the earthquake in Morocco has caused so much damage?**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Factor**|**Explanation**|
|**Epicentre Location**|The earthquake’s epicentre was in the **High Atlas Mountains** (close to the city of Marrakesh), causing it to affect populated areas and infrastructure.|
|**Depth**|The depth of the earthquake, estimated between **8km and 26km**, was **relatively shallow**, making it more dangerous as shallow earthquakes transmit more energy to the surface.|
|**Previous Earthquake Activity**|The region had **not experienced major recorded earthquakes** before, suggesting that **stress had been accumulating underground** for an extended period before being released in this earthquake.|
|**Lack of Preparedness**|**Earthquakes are relatively rare in North Africa**, so Morocco was not well-prepared for such a calamity. Many buildings, especially in rural areas and older cities, **were not constructed to withstand strong tremors**.|

[**Earthquake Prone areas in India**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/23/60-of-india-prone-to-earthquake/)**:**

The **Western Himalayas in India** are considered one of the most dangerous seismic zones globally, and the entire Himalayan region, spanning from the Hindu Kush mountains to Arunachal Pradesh, is at risk of a major earthquake with a magnitude **exceeding 8 on the Richter scale**. This heightened risk is attributed to the **substantial energy accumulation along faultlines due** to the ongoing interaction of various tectonic plates.

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Earthquake.png)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Earthquake.png)

However, earthquakes **cannot be accurately predicted** because there is **currently no equipment or method** to detect precursory signals within the Earth that would indicate an **impending major earthquake**. Such signals would need to be specific to significant seismic events and not indicative of minor movements in the Earth’s crust.

 **Context:** The Supreme Court of India has **ruled that a 2014 judgment** declaring a legal provision **requiring prior permission for the** [**Central Bureau of Investigation**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/04/02/220937/) **(CBI)** to investigate corruption cases **against senior government officials is retrospective.**

- This means that the provision, **Section 6A of the Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) Act**, has **been considered void** from the day of its **insertion on September 11, 2003.**
    - CBI powers are derived from the DSPE Act
- The Court stated that **Section 6A violated** [**fundamental rights**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/indian-constitution/significant-provisions/fundamental-rights/fundamental-rights-articles-12-35/) and that once a law is declared unconstitutional, it is void from its inception.

 **Context:** Under India’s Union Education and Skills Development Minister’s leadership, the G20 nations have adopted indicators from the [**ILO**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/05/24/ilo-monitor-on-the-world-of-work/) **and** [**OECD**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/19/tax-challenges-arising-from-the-digitalisation-of-the-economy/) to track the global skills gap.

**What is a** [**Skills Gap**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Skilling-India.pdf)**?**

A skills gap refers to the **mismatch between the skills and qualifications that job seekers** possess and those that employers require for available positions. It means that there are often **unfilled job openings** because potential employees lack the necessary skills and knowledge for these roles.

- **Types of skill mismatches** include skill shortages, qualification mismatch, skill gaps, skill obsolescence, and over/under skilling.

**India’s Skill Gap:**

- **Only 49% of Indian youth** is employable, points out the [India Skills Report](https://do3n1uzkew47z.cloudfront.net/siteassets/pdf/ISR_Report_2023.pdf)
- According to the **National Employability Report for Engineering**, **80% of Indian engineers** don’t possess the required skills.

### [Gresham’s Law](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/09/13/greshams-law/)

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/specials/text-and-context/greshams-law-what-happens-when-governments-fix-currency-exchange-rates/article67296093.ece#:~:text=So%2C%20when%20the%20price%20of,for%20the%20currency%20outpacing%20supply.)

 **Gresham’s Law,** named after Thomas Gresham, states that “**bad money drives out good”** when the government [**fixes the exchange rate**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/11/25/why-is-it-essential-to-contain-domestic-inflation/) **between two currencies at a level different from the market rate**.

**Impact**:

- This leads to the **undervalued currency going out of circulation**, while the overvalued currency remains but **lacks buyers**.
- The law can **result in a currency shortage** when demand exceeds supply due to the fixed price.

Gresham’s law applies not only to **paper currencies but also to commodities.** It can cause goods to disappear from the formal market when their prices are forcibly undervalued by governments.

**Explanation using example:**

**Imagine a country where both gold coins and copper coins are used as currency**. The government sets an exchange rate, **saying that 10 copper coins are equal in value to 1 gold coin,** even though the market values them differently.

In this scenario, people will **start hoarding and using gold coins** because they are more valuable. They will spend copper coins, which are **considered “bad money**,” in everyday transactions, keeping the “**good money” (gold coins) for themselves**.

Eventually, the **circulation of copper coins increases**, while gold coins become scarce in daily transactions. This demonstrates Gresham’s Law in action, where the **undervalued (copper) currency** pushes out the more **valuable (gold) currency** from everyday use.

**The alternative:**

**Thiers’ law**, on the other hand, states that **“good money drives out bad”** when people have the freedom to choose between currencies, and they prefer higher-quality currencies.

### [Dolly the sheep](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/09/13/dolly-the-sheep/)

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/ian-wilmut-dies-dolly-the-sheep-scientist-8936193/)

**Context:** Ian Wilmut, **the British embryologist** renowned for **leading the team that created Dolly the Sheep,** the **world’s first** [**cloned**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/science-technology/biotechnology/cloning/) **mammal** from an adult cell, has passed away recently.

**About Dolly:**

- Dolly the Sheep, **born in 1996,** marked a **significant scientific breakthrough in the 20th century**. Wilmut, along with his team, accomplished the unprecedented feat of making **an adult cell behave like a cell from a newly fertilized embryo**, resulting in the **creation of an animal genetically identical to the donor**.
- They achieved this by **taking a cell from the mammary gland** of a deceased adult sheep, stimulating it with **electricity and chemicals to transform its DNA into an embryo**, and then **implanting it into an empty sheep’s egg, which was later placed into a surrogate sheep.**
- Dolly’s birth **raised ethical debates about cloning research**, and it prompted then-U.S. President Bill Clinton to announce a ban on human cloning experiments about a year later.
- **Dolly’s life was** **tragically short-lived**, as she developed an **incurable lung tumour** and **was euthanized by scientists about six years after her birth.**

Following the success of the Dolly experiment, Wilmut shifted his focus to using cloning technology to **create stem cells for potential use in regenerative medicine**. His research played a crucial role in **advancing treatments for genetic and degenerative diseases by aiding in tissue repair within the human body.**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/iisc-scientists-develop-novel-approach-to-detect-and-kill-cancer-cells/article67294803.ece) 

**Context:** Scientists at the **Indian Institute of Science (IISc)** have developed a **novel approach to detect and potentially kill** [**cancer cells**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/17/cancer-in-india-a-status-report/)**,** especially those **forming solid tumour masses**.

- They created **hybrid nanoparticles** consisting of **gold and copper sulphide**, which can both kill cancer cells using **heat and facilitate their detection using sound waves**.
- These hybrid nanoparticles possess **photothermal, oxidative stress, and photoacoustic properties**. When exposed to light, they absorb it and generate heat, which can be **lethal to cancer cells.**
- Additionally, these **nanoparticles produce singlet oxygen atoms that are toxic to cells, providing a dual mechanism for cell destruction.**
- Moreover, these nanoparticles **have the potential to aid in cancer diagnosis**. Their photoacoustic property allows them to **absorb light and generate ultrasound waves**, which can be **used to detect cancer cells with high contrast once the particles reach them.**
- The **small size of these hybrid nanoparticles** (less than 8 nm) makes them suitable for travelling within tissues and reaching tumours.

Devastating floods in **Derna, eastern** [**Libya**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/tag/libya/)**, have resulted in over 5,000 feared dead** and thousands missing due to breached dams and flash floods caused by the **Mediterranean storm named Daniel**.

**What is a** [**Mediterranean**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/tag/mediterranean-sea/) **storm?** 

A Mediterranean storm, also known as a Mediterranean cyclone or a Mediterranean low, is a type of weather system that forms over the Mediterranean Sea. Mediterranean storms can vary in intensity and impact, but they often lead to heavy precipitation, which can result in flooding, landslides, and other weather-related hazards.

Libya is a country in the **Maghreb region of North Africa**. It is bordered by the **Mediterranean Sea to the north, Egypt to the east**, Sudan to the southeast, Chad to the south, Niger to the southwest, Algeria to the west, and Tunisia to the northwest.
