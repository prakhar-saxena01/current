**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/three-years-of-the-abraham-accords/article67327731.ece)

**Context**: The article discusses the **significance of the** [**Abraham Accords**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/09/17/abraham-accords-have-led-to-greater-regional-cooperation/), a series of agreements between Israel and various Arab nations, which have led to **improved regional ties and opportunities**.

**What is** [**Abraham Accord**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/09/17/abraham-accords-have-led-to-greater-regional-cooperation/)**?** 

Brokered by the USA, the [**Abraham Accord**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/09/17/abraham-accords-have-led-to-greater-regional-cooperation/) **(2020) is a normalization agreement between the UAE and Israel** to establish formal diplomatic relations. The accord was later joined by **Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco** and in exchange Israel would suspend its plans to annex parts of the occupied West Bank. With this accord, **UAE becomes the third Arab nation** to recognize Israel after Egypt (in 1979) and Jordan (1994)

**Significance of the** [**Abraham Accords**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/09/17/abraham-accords-have-led-to-greater-regional-cooperation/)**:**

|The Abraham Accord **encourages collaboration and education**|
|The UAE incorporated **Holocaust education into its school curriculum** as a mandatory subject, fostering coexistence and religious tolerance.|

**About ‘New QUAD’:**

**Mohammed Soliman**, An Egyptian scholar, was the **first to propound the idea** of the **“Indo-Abrahamic Accord**” and its trans-regional implications to the west of India. The first meeting between the foreign ministers of India, Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States is being widely called a new QUAD or QUAD of the Middle East on the lines of the Abraham Accord.

**Significance of Abraham Accord for India:** 

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Significance**|**Details**|
|**Economic Cooperation**|Substantial increase in the **commercial collaborations between companies** from the UAE, Israel, Bahrain, and the U.S., partnering with the Indian private sector|
|**Opportunities for Students**|Indian students are **enjoying increased ease of travel, gaining improved access to universities** and the opportunity to explore international study programmes.|

|**Extended Neighbourhood**|Engagement opens **opportunities to collaborate** with other regional partners like Egypt, expanding India’s impact in the region.|
|**Peace and Stability**|The agreement fosters rapprochement between traditional adversaries in West Asia, Israel, and the Arab states, providing a platform for India’s engagement.|
|**Group Formation**|The Accords facilitated the **formation of the I2U2 Group**, established by Israel, India, the UAE, and the United States.|

**Conclusion:**

The opportunities for India to the west of the Subcontinent are as significant as those that have recently emerged in the east like QUAD, which has changed the way India had transformed the way it thinks of the “**Indo-Pacific**”, the notion of a “**Greater Middle East**” can provide myriad opportunities to India’s engagement with the extended neighbourhood to the west.

### [Ethics and Outer Space](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/09/22/ethics-and-outer-space/)

#### **GS Paper 4**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://epaper.thehindu.com/ccidist-ws/th/th_delhi/issues/52552/OPS/G3FBPBCPP.1+GVLBPBGBO.1.html#:~:text=And%20thereby%20inaugurate%20a%20new%20ethics%20for%20human,the%20non-militarisation%20of%20outer%20space%20a%20non-negotiable%20covenant.)

 **Context: After the success of Chandrayaan – 3 there have been** discussions on the **ethical frontiers of space exploration.**

- Ethics in **outer space exploration is a critical and evolving** consideration as **humanity continues to expand its presence beyond Earth’s boundaries.**

**Several key ethical principles and challenges are associated with outer space activities:**

- **Peaceful Use of Outer Space:** One of the foundational principles of space ethics, **as enshrined in the Outer Space Treaty of 1967,** is the commitment to using outer space for peaceful purposes. This principle aims to **prevent the weaponization of space and the potential for armed conflict in this new frontier.**
- **Common Heritage of Mankind:** The **Moon Agreement, adopted in 1979**, established the idea that **celestial bodies like the moon and their resources should be considered the common heritage** of all humanity.
- **Environmental Responsibility**: As space activities increase, **so does the risk of space debris, which poses a hazard to both operational satellites and future missions**.
- **Planetary Protection:** When **exploring other celestial bodies, especially those with the potential for past or present extra-terrestrial life**, planetary protection principles must be followed.
- **Transparency and Information Sharing**: Nations and organizations engaged in space exploration **should share information about their missions, including launch plans, trajectories, and orbital data, to ensure safety and avoid collisions.**
- **Resource Utilization:** There’s a need to **establish guidelines for responsible resource utilization to prevent over-exploitation and ensure that benefits are shared fairly.**
- **Space Tourism and Access:** As commercial space tourism becomes a reality, ethical questions arise **concerning accessibility, affordability, and safety for space tourists**.
- **Space Governance and Regulation**: Establishing governance mechanisms for space activities and ensuring that international laws and agreements are respected are ethical imperatives.
- **Global Collaboration:** **Ethical space exploration requires international collaboration to address common challenges and promote the responsible use of space**.

Ethical considerations in outer space exploration encompass a broad range of principles, from **preventing the militarization of space to ensuring equitable access and resource utilization**. As humanity’s activities in space continue to expand, **these ethical principles will play a crucial role in shaping the future of space exploration and ensuring that it benefits all of humanity while minimizing harm to the cosmos.**

### [Formation of Pink Diamond](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/09/22/formation-of-pink-diamond/)

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**Earth**](https://www.earth.com/news/pink-diamonds-were-formed-when-supercontinent-nuna-broke-up/)

 **Context:** Western Australian scientists have connected pink diamond formation to the Earth’s first supercontinent (Vaalbara or Nuna) and events **1.3 billion** years ago.

**What are pink** [**diamonds**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/23/lab-grown-diamond/)**?**

Pink diamonds are a **rare and highly coveted type of diamond** known for their stunning pink or reddish-pink colour. Pink diamonds are exceptionally rare, and their rarity, combined with their captivating beauty, makes them extremely valuable.

**How it is unique?**

Pink diamonds get their distinct colour from **unique structural irregularities in the crystal lattice of the diamond**, rather than impurities like nitrogen or boron, which give other coloured diamonds their hues (such as in the case of Yellow and blue diamonds)

**Where is it found?**

The **Argyle diamond mine in Western Australia** was one of the primary sources of pink diamonds (over 90% of production), although it **ceased production in 2020**. Pink diamonds from the Argyle mine were particularly famous for their **quality and colour intensity**.

**What does the study indicate?**

Pink diamonds were formed as a result of the breakup of Earth’s first supercontinent, Vaalbara, through **intense geological forces from colliding tectonic plates** that caused their **crystal lattices to twist and bend**. The critical event that **turned once-colourless diamonds** into pink was a monumental collision between **Western Australia and Northern Australia.**

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/this-iia-study-could-help-understand-how-gravitational-instabilities-are-connected-to-galaxy-evolution/article67326296.ece)

 **Context:** A study conducted by the **Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA)** aims to understand the connection between [**gravitational instabilities**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/01/gravitational-vibrations/) **and galaxy evolution**.

**What are Gravitational Instabilities?**

Gravitational instabilities **refer to disruptions or fluctuations in the gravitational forces** within a **celestial object**, such as a **galaxy or a cloud of gas and dust**. These instabilities can lead to the **formation of structures like stars, planets, or galaxies** as matter clumps together under the influence of gravity.

**Findings of the study:**

- The study shed light on **the role of dark matter in regulating galaxy stability**.
- It found that gravitational instabilities in **spiral galaxies like the Milky Way** rapidly convert **gas into stars, depleting gas reservoirs**.
- This led to higher star formation rates, lower stability, and lower gas fraction in such galaxies.

**How are** [**galaxies formed**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/world-geography/physical-geography-of-the-world/origin-and-evolution-of-universe-solar-system/origin-and-evolution-of-the-earth/formation-of-galaxies-and-stars/)**?**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Stage**|**Description**|
|**1. Primordial Matter**|Cosmic matter, including hydrogen and helium, is evenly distributed throughout the universe.|
|**2. Gravitational Attraction**|Gravity causes slightly denser regions to form from the cosmic matter.|
|**3. Protogalactic Clouds**|Denser regions accumulate gas, dust, and dark matter through gravity.|
|**4. Star Formation**|Protogalactic clouds fragment into smaller clumps, giving birth to stars.|
|**5. Galaxy Formation**|Stars within the clouds begin to orbit a common centre of mass, forming a galaxy.|
|**6. Galaxy Types**|The type and appearance of the galaxy (spiral, elliptical, irregular) depend on various factors.|

Tardigrades are **tiny eight-legged animals that are extremophiles**, capable of surviving in extreme conditions for **up to 30 years without food or water**. When faced with harsh environments, they **enter a state of suspended animation called the “tun” state**, where their bodies **dry out and appear lifeless**. Their diet primarily consists of **plants**, but some tardigrades are **predatory carnivores**. Tardigrades can be found in **various ecosystems** beyond just aquatic environments.

**Significance**: This discovery is significant as it is the **second marine tardigrade** found in Indian waters and the first on the East Coast. It is also the first taxonomically described species of the genus **Batillipes** from India.
