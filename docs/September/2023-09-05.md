 **Context:** Recently, a report prepared by **Global Wastewater Initiative (GWWI)**, a global platform bringing together UN agencies, NGOs, the private sector etc. to tackle wastewater pollution, “[**Wastewater**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/05/15/the-menace-of-wastewater/) **– Turning Problem to Solution**” was released.

- This report follows up on the **Sick Water report from 2011** and aims to address the urgent need for **sustainable water and wastewater management**.

**What is** [**Wastewater**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/05/15/the-menace-of-wastewater/)**?**

Wastewater refers to water that has been used and contaminated through various human activities, such as domestic, industrial, or agricultural processes.

**Key Messages of the Report:**

- **Wastewater reuse could supply** more than ten times the current **global** [**desalination**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/11/24/what-are-desalination-plants/)
- To unlock this potential, **public perceptions and concerns** about wastewater resource recovery and reuse must change.
- **Elevating wastewater reuse** in international policy is crucial to addressing climate, nature, and pollution crises.
- **The huge potential of wastewater**: It could serve as an alternative energy source for up to half a billion people, reduce global fertilizer use by **over 10%,** and irrigate around 40 million hectares of land.
- **Raw source for Industries**: Wastewater can be a source of raw materials for various industries, including paper, polymers, pesticides, rubber, paint, biodiesel, food additives, and more, contributing to economic and environmental sustainability.

**The Issues:**

- **Improper wastewater management is a global challenge**, exacerbated by population growth, urbanization, and climate change.
- **By 2030, domestic and municipal wastewater production** is estimated to rise by **24-38%**
- **Only 11% of domestic and industrial wastewater** is currently being reused, indicating untapped potential.
- Untreated wastewater remains a significant issue, **with approximately 50% of it entering the environment.**
- **Vulnerable groups**, especially women and children, are disproportionately affected by poor wastewater management.
- **Sustainable wastewater management offers** co-benefits like improved environmental and human health, **reduced dependence on synthetic fertilizers**, and **energy diversification**.
- **Barriers to wastewater resource recovery** include inadequate political support, governance issues, data deficits, financing challenges, and cultural perceptions.

**The Solution:**

- **Sustainable wastewater management** involves three key action areas:
    - Reducing wastewater production
    - Preventing contamination
    - Sustainably managing wastewater for resource recovery and reuse.
- Addressing these areas requires building blocks **like effective governance, mobilizing investment, enhancing capacity**, fostering innovation, data collection, and increasing communication and awareness.
- **Realizing the economic value of wastewater is essential**, and a shared vision and collective action are needed from individuals, businesses, governments, and society to drive change at scale.
- **Detailed guidance on sewage treatment** and reuse technologies.
- **Effective financing mechanisms** that permit sufficient cost recovery.

**The impact of food on climate**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Impact**|**Examples**|
|**Greenhouse Gas Emissions**|Agriculture contributed to **11% of** [**global greenhouse** gas emissions](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/04/a-plateau-global-co2-emissions-rose-less-than-initially-feared-in-2022-says-iea/) in 2018.|
|[**Livestock digestion**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/19/how-can-methane-released-in-livestock-belches-be-reduced/) produces methane emissions (10% of agricultural emissions). India, with its large **livestock population, generates 8%** of its total greenhouse gases from methane emissions.|
|**Synthetic fertilizers and rice cultivation** also contribute to emissions.|
|**Land use change and** [**deforestation**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/environment-degradation-and-issues/deforestation-and-forest-degradation/#:~:text=Deforestation%20affects%20wind%20flows%2C%20water,release%20it%20into%20the%20atmosphere.) for agriculture release carbon dioxide (CO2).|
|||
|**Food Production**|**Energy-intensive processes** in food production lead to CO2 emissions.|
|**Transportation of food** over long distances results in fossil fuel consumption and emissions.|
|**Food Waste**|**Decomposing food waste in landfills** produces methane gas, a potent greenhouse gas.|
|The resources used to produce **wasted food contribute to emissions**.|
|**Packaging**|**Production and disposal of food packaging** materials generate CO2 emissions.|
|**Plastic packaging contributes** to plastic pollution and affects ecosystems.|
|**Food Choices**|Consumption of high-impact foods like **red meat generates more emissions** than plant-based diets|

The [UN Framework Convention on Climate Change](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/21/the-bonn-climate-change-conference/) (UNFCCC) has **not strongly addressed food production’s impact on** climate. Efforts to reduce emissions, such as the **Netherlands’ attempt to reduce nitrous oxide emissions**, have faced resistance and protests. Similarly, **New Zealand’s proposal for a “burp” tax faced opposition**. The influence of the meat industry on emissions remains challenging to confront, comparable to the fossil fuel sector.

**Solutions:**

- **Importance of** [**Adaptation**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/25/cop-28-dubai-must-focus-on-adaptation-instead-of-mitigation-says-india/): Scaling up support, including finance, capacity-building, and technology transfer, is urgent to enhance adaptive capacity and reduce vulnerability.
- **Crop diversification:** Diversifying cropping patterns, particularly towards millets, pulses, and horticulture, for sustainable agriculture.
- **Adaptation Finance**: Multilateral banks, financial institutions, and the private sector should mobilize more resources for adaptation.
- **Multi-Pronged Approach**: Addressing the climate-hunger crisis involves creating resilient livelihoods, promoting climate-resilient food crops, empowering women, supporting small-holder farmers, and increasing knowledge about vulnerability and food security.
- **Sustainable Food Systems**: Sustainability should be integrated into production, value chains, and consumption.
    - **Cash transfers for sustainable agriculture** can be more effective than input subsidies.
- **Non-Agriculture Sector:** Labor-intensive manufacturing and services can reduce the pressure on agriculture, especially for **smallholders and informal workers**.
    - Strengthening rural MSMEs and the food processing sector is part of the solution.
