### [Accession of Hyderabad to India](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/09/19/accession-of-hyderabad-to-india/)

#### **GS Paper 1**

 **Syllabus: Post-Independent India**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/the-accession-of-hyderabad-8944100/)**, IE**

 **Context:** This year marks the **75th anniversary of Operation Polo and ‘Police Action’** in Hyderabad

**A Brief History of** [**Hyderabad**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/modern-indian-history/indian-kingdoms-in-18th-century/hyderabad/) 

Founded in 1591, it became the **capital of the Qutb Shahi Kingdom (**Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah founded the city**)**. In 1724, Nizam-ul-Mulk established the **Asaf-Jah dynasty**. Hyderabad thrived culturally, with landmarks like **Charminar and Golconda Fort**.

**Accession of Hyderabad to India**

Hyderabad, a significant princely state, was ruled by the **Nizams under British paramountcy**. Unlike other princely states, the **Nizam did not accede to India** at independence in 1947, aiming for independence and receiving support from Pakistan. 

- **Nizam’s Reluctance:** In August 1947, Hyderabad’s Nizam, Mir Usman Ali, had hopes of Hyderabad remaining independent due to its wealth, historical significance, and personal ties.
- **Sardar Patel’s Approach**: Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, India’s Deputy Prime Minister, handled Hyderabad cautiously. He recognized the **strategic importance of Hyderabad** and believed that pushing too hard might drive the Nizam towards joining Pakistan.
- **Role of Razakars**: **The Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen**, led by Qasim Razvi, became violent and extremist, forming a paramilitary group called ‘**razakars’** with state support. They brutally suppressed **opposition to the Nizam**.
- **Peasant Movements**: Hyderabad witnessed a satyagraha for democracy and a Communist-led peasant movement against landholdings, forced labour, and excessive taxes. These movements gained strength **against the Nizam’s rule**.
- **Operation Polo:** In September 1948, the Indian Army launched Operation Polo to annex Hyderabad. The **Nizam’s forces surrendered**, and the razakars were banned. This marked the end of the Nizam’s rule.

**Aftermaths:**

- **After the operation, widespread communal violence** occurred, with death estimates ranging from 27,000 to 200,000.
- **The Nizam retained a symbolic role**, disowned **UN complaints, and Hyderabad** was absorbed into India despite protests from Pakistan and criticism from other countries.

**Significance:**

Hyderabad’s accession to India was a **significant achievement for Indian secularism**, demonstrating unity and the **acceptance of diversity within the newly independent nation**. It was also seen as a problem resolved through peaceful means.

**Prelims links:**

### [Case Study: Gender impacts of Climate change in Jharkhand](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/09/19/case-study-gender-impacts-of-climate-change-in-jharkhand/)

#### **GS2/GS3/GS1 Paper** 

 **Syllabus: Government policies and Intervention/ Environment Conservation/ Impact on women**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/climate-change/gendered-impacts-of-climate-change-stories-from-jharkhand-91800#:~:text=We%20feel%20unsafe%20in%20their,in%20the%20absence%20of%20men.)

 **Context:** Climate change in Jharkhand has [**gender-specific impacts**, as women and girls](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/02/impact-of-climate-change-on-children/) in both rural villages and urban slums face unique challenges:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Impact on Women and Girls**|**Challenges**|**Consequences**|
|**Agriculture and Livelihood**|Male migration for work due to poor productivity in agriculture|Women taking on extra chores traditionally carried out by men e.g., roof repair|
|**Health Vulnerabilities**|Inability to seek emergency medical services at night in male absence|Increased health risks due to limited access to healthcare|
|**Increased Workload**|Scarcity of resources like water and firewood|Burden on girls with more responsibilities leading to school dropouts and early marriages|
|**Unsafe** [**Migration**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/State-of-Internal-Migration-in-India.pdf)|Limited awareness of migration safeguards|Safety concerns and harassment during migration|
|Lack of knowledge about safeguards against abuse|
|**Poor Working Conditions**|Women working in factories endure poor conditions, lower wages and health hazards|Health hazards, skin reactions, and long hours|
|**Extreme heat and water scarcity**|**Water and firewood scarcity** increases the time spent collecting them by women, and cattle must graze in distant areas due to a lack of available grass (creating issues about the safety of girls)|   |
|**Disrupted Caregiving**|When **women migrate for work and leave their children** in the care of their father or grandparents, **caregiving gets disrupted in their absence**, and many times, the men **use the money they send back for alcohol**, which makes the children more vulnerable.|   |

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/climate_cha.png)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/climate_cha.png)

To address these challenges, **solutions include rainwater harvesting systems, reviving traditional eating habits, and promoting the cultivation of millets** and local nutritious foods. Awareness and preparedness for climate change impacts are also emphasized.

**Best Practices for Women’s Involvement in Climate Change Plans:**

### [Tackling Food Inflation](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/09/19/tackling-food-inflation/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus: Indian Economy/ Agriculture**

**Source:** [**ICRIER**](https://icrier.org/publications/tackling-food-inflation-is-restricting-exports-and-imposing-stocking-limits-the-optimal-policy/)

 **Context**: An ICRIER paper, **“Tackling Food Inflation: Is restricting exports and imposing stocking limits the optimal policy?”** discusses the **causes of high food inflation in India**, and government actions, and suggests alternative solutions.

**Current status of India’s Food Inflation:**

India’s retail inflation in **August 2023 is at 6.83%,** exceeding the desired ceiling of 6%. Food and beverages contribute significantly, **making up 57% of retail inflation**. Food inflation has risen **sharply to 9.94%,** impacting overall retail inflation.

**Government initiatives to contain inflation:**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Government Actions**|**Date**|**Details**|
|**Wheat Export Ban**|May 2022|Prohibited wheat exports to control prices.|
|**Rice Export Restrictions**|September 2022|Halted exports of broken rice.|
|July 2023|Imposed export ban on non-basmati white rice.|
|**Stocking Limits**|June 2023|Introduced stocking limits for wheat traders and millers.|
|**Rice Export Duties**|July 2023|Imposed 20% export duty on parboiled rice.|
|August 2023|Set a Minimum Export Price of $1,200 per tonne for basmati rice.|
|**Export Duty on Onion**|August 2023|Imposed a substantial 40% export duty on onions.|

**Export ban impacts:**

- **Wheat Inflation Surge**: After the May 2022 wheat export ban, inflation rose from about 9% to about 25% by February 2023.
- **Market Uncertainty**: Sudden bans caused market unpredictability, affecting traders and consumers.
- **Rice Inflation Stagnation:** Non-basmati rice export ban in July 2023 had a limited impact on 13% inflation, reducing it slightly to 12.5%.
- **Consumer Panic:** Non-basmati rice ban alarmed local and diaspora consumers.
- **Implications for Farmers:** Farmers faced the consequences of rapid government measures.
- **Indicates a bias in favour of urban consumers** and hurts farmer’s earnings
- **Impacts global food security**, as it has hit the African countries most.

**Recommendations by the ICRIER paper for containing food Inflation:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Timeframe**|**Policy Recommendations**|
|**Short-Term**|Efficiently calibrate trade policy instead of protectionism.|
|Reduce import duties on edible oils and wheat. **Import prices should ideally not be lower than MSP** to ensure that farmers at least get the minimum price.|
|**Build buffer stocks** for volatile vegetable staples (TOP).|
|Expand **cold storage infrastructure** and use solar energy for storage.|
|**Promote processing of at least 10%** of fresh produce.|
|Support **Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs)** and farmer cooperatives.|
|Invest in **R&D to enhance productivity** and climate-resilient farming practices.|
|Increase irrigation coverage through **micro-irrigation infrastructure**.|

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Medium-Term**|Reform marketing and trade policies to benefit both consumers and farmers.|
|Boost the processing sector, especially for fresh produce.|
|Use schemes like “Operation Greens” to support FPOs and processing facilities.|
|||
|**Long-Term**|Increase investments in R&D for innovative farming practices.|
|Develop drought-resistant seed varieties and adaptive farming methods.|
|Expand irrigation coverage with micro-irrigation for climate resilience.|
|Revamp the policy matrix to align with climate change challenges.|

 **Context:** The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change celebrated the **29th World Ozone Day,** commemorating the signing of **the Montreal Protocol in 1987**, which aimed to phase out Ozone Depleting Substances.

- The theme for World Ozone Day 2023 is **“Montreal Protocol: fixing the ozone layer and reducing climate change.”**

**About** [**Ozone Layer**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/03/recovery-of-the-ozone-layer/)**:**

The ozone layer or ozone **shield is a region of Earth’s stratosphere that absorbs most of the Sun’s ultraviolet radiation.** It contains a high concentration of ozone (O3) in relation to other parts of the atmosphere, although still small in relation to other gases in the lower part of the stratosphere (15-35 Km above the surface of the earth)

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/atmospher.jpg)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/atmospher.jpg)

**Montreal Protocol and its amendments** are successful in **eliminating up to 99% of Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS)** (long-lived man-made chemicals which destroy the protective ozone layer). The ozone layer is predicted to **return to 1980 levels over Antarctica by 2066**, **2045 for the Arctic, and 2040** for the remainder of the planet.

India has been **proactive in implementing the Montreal Protocol,** phasing out harmful substances and achieving reductions. Initiatives include:

- **India Cooling Action Plan (ICAP)** to address refrigerant transition, energy efficiency, and technology advancement in cooling systems
- **The Kigali Amendment** to the Montreal Protocol focuses on reducing the production and consumption of high global warming potential HFCs, with India committed to phasing them out gradually.
- **The Ozone Cell collaborates with the Indian Institutes of Technology** to promote research and development of low global warming potential chemicals.
