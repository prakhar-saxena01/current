**Context:** The [Jal Jeevan Mission](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/05/31/jal-jeevan-mission-jjm-4/) (JJM), a central government initiative to provide piped water to every rural household by 2024, faces challenges and limitations.

**About the mission:**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/jal.png)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/jal.png)

A fully functional tap water connection is defined as a **household getting at least 55 litres** of potable water per capita per day all through the year

**Achievements of the mission:**

- **Over two-thirds (66%) of rural households**in India now have piped water connections, a significant leap from the 2019 baseline of 17%.
- **States Achieving 100% Tap Connectivity:** Goa, Telangana, Haryana.
- **Union Territories Achieving 100% Tap Connectivity**: Puducherry, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Dadra & Nagar Haveli, Daman & Diu.
- **States with over 90% FHTC Coverage**: Punjab, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Bihar
- **States with Least FHTC Coverage**: Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh

**Present challenges with the mission:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Aspect**|**Details**|
|**State Disparities**|**Only a few states** report high coverage rates. In contrast, populous states like Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan have lower coverage.|
|**Quality Concerns**|Some households, despite having tap connections, use local groundwater due to **inadequate tap water quality**.|
|**Reporting and Certification**|Adoption numbers **rely on self-reporting by villages and lack third-party certification.**|
|||
|**Shortcomings in Reality**|Despite official claims of **100% household tap connections (FHTC),** many households lack taps, and those with taps often receive limited water|
|**Discrepancies in Reporting**|Discrepancies exist between **official reports and ground reality**, where eligible FHTC households are not fully connected to running water supply.|
|**Water Treatment Efforts**|Water treatment plants have been commissioned to address water scarcity, but the challenge lies in **commissioning pipes over difficult terrain**.|
|**Taps Get Stolen**|In some areas, **taps provided by the mission have been stolen**, and households lack sufficient storage to maintain a continuous water supply.|

**Suggestions:**

- **Quality Over Quantity**: Prioritizing consistent, high-quality tap water adoption in rural India is crucial. States with lower adoption rates and larger populations should receive assistance to improve their numbers.
- **Third-Party Assessment**: Implement third-party assessments to verify the accuracy of reported tap water connections, ensuring transparency and accountability.
- **Focus on Lagging States**: Prioritize states with lower adoption rates and larger populations to accelerate progress toward universal tap water coverage.
- **Public Awareness**: Conduct awareness campaigns to educate rural communities on the benefits of clean tap water and proper water usage.
- **Make the** [**Right to Water Legal**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2015/08/27/3-the-right-to-access-water-is-considered-as-a-human-rights-issue-critically-discuss-how-this-issue-is-interrelated-to-the-claims-of-riparian-states-claim-to-share-of-river-waters/): In India, the **right to water is not enshrined as a fundamental right** in the Constitution.

**Other steps are taken for water management in Urban Areas:**

- **National Aquifer Management Program:** For mapping of aquifers, characterization, and development of aquifer management plans.
- [**National Water Policy**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/11/12/new-water-policy/) **(2012):** Include provisions like rainwater harvesting, augmenting the availability of water through direct use of rainfall, etc.

**Conclusion:**

On 28 July 2010, through **Resolution 64/292, the United Nations General Assembly** explicitly recognized the **human right to water and sanitation and acknowledged that clean drinking water and sanitation are essential to the realization of all human rights**.

### [Examples of Ethics (16th September)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/09/16/examples-of-ethics-16th-september/)

#### **GS Paper 4**

 **Syllabus: Applications of Ethics**

**Source:** [TH](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/missing-defence-minister-brings-spotlight-to-xis-purges/article67312492.ece#:~:text=Two%20months%20after%20Foreign%20Minister,detained%20over%20ongoing%20corruption%20investigations), [LM](https://www.livemint.com/news/world/whats-at-stake-as-13-000-workers-go-on-strike-at-major-us-auto-makers-11694825930583.html#:~:text=About%2013%2C000%20auto%20workers%20have,General%20Motors%2C%20Ford%20and%20Stellantis.)

This is in continuation of yesterday’s [**Examples of Ethics**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/09/15/examples-of-ethics-3/)

**Example 1: China Xi’s Purges**

**Context:** Chinese Defence Minister Li Shangfu has **reportedly been detained** as part of ongoing corruption investigations. This follows the **disappearance of Foreign Minister Qin Gang earlie**r, with no explanation provided for his removal from office.

- These developments raise questions about **Xi’s control over the military and ongoing political purges** in China.

**Ethical Issues with the Purges:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Ethical Issues**|**Description**|
|**Lack of Transparency**|The sudden disappearance of officials without clear explanations raises **concerns about transparency**|
|**Political Purges**|Removal of **high-ranking officials** may indicate an attempt to **consolidate power and eliminate rivals**.|
|**Rule of Law**|Detaining officials in corruption investigations should **adhere to the rule of law.**|
|**Lack of Due Process**|Detentions without clear legal processes raise concerns about due **process and human rights**.|
|**Secrecy**|Providing vague explanations like “health reasons” contributes to a **lack of trust.**|
|**“Chilling Effect” on Bureaucracy**|This may create fear in the minds of government officials while making a decision and lead to **policy paralysis**|

**Example 2: “Corporate Greed is the Problem”**

**Context:** Over **13,000 workers from major US automakers** (General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis) going on strike due to issues with contract negotiations. The United Auto Workers (UAW) union is seeking **higher wages, better benefits**, and the reversal of concessions made during the companies’ financial difficulties.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Ethical Issue**|**Example**|
|**Income Inequality**|CEOs earn millions while **workers struggle for fair wages**.|
|**Worker Exploitation**|For automakers, **worker’s compensation makes up just 4 to 5% of their total cost**. Despite this, companies underpay workers, provide poor working conditions, or foster job insecurity to cut labour costs.|
|**Unfair Labor Practices**|Despite the **three companies making over USD 164 billion** in profit last year, they are resisting fair wage increases and better benefits.|
|**Environmental Impact**|Companies prioritise profits over sustainability.|
|**Social Responsibility**|Companies neglect their role in society and their impact on workers.|

 **Context:** The Delhi government has **banned the manufacture, sale, and use of glue pads for rodent control,** joining several Indian states in taking this step.

- The ban follows **an advisory by the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) in 2011 and a subsequent one in 2021**

**About Glue Pads:**

- Glue pads are considered a **cruel method of killing rodents** as animals that **get trapped in the strong glue die slowly from starvation and extreme pain.**

Rat poison, often used as an alternative to glue pads, is also **considered inhumane and poses risks to the ecosystem,** animals that feed on poisoned rats, **such as cats, snakes, mongoose, and predatory birds, can be harmed by the toxins.**
