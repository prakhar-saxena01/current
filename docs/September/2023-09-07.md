### [Forest Restoration](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/09/07/forest-restoration/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/india-was-a-tree-planting-laboratory-for-200-years-here-are-the-results/article67273574.ece#:~:text=The%20result%20is%20that%20afforestation,to%20wattle%20200%20years%20ago.&text=There%20are%20positive%20case%20studies%20too.)

**Context**: For over two centuries, India has been a **laboratory for tree planting experiments**, offering valuable insights into the consequences of various approaches to forest restoration.

**What is** [**Deforestation**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/environment-degradation-and-issues/deforestation-and-forest-degradation/#:~:text=Deforestation%20affects%20wind%20flows%2C%20water,release%20it%20into%20the%20atmosphere.)**?**

Deforestation is the process of clearing or removing a large area of forests or trees, typically due to human activities such as logging, agriculture, urban development, or infrastructure expansion.

**Drivers of Deforestation in Tropical Areas:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Drivers**|**Examples**|
|**Economic Drivers**|[**Amazon rainforest**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/10/06/40-of-the-amazon-rainforest-is-at-tipping-point-to-becoming-savanna/) **in Brazil:** Threatened by logging, mining, and agriculture due to economic incentives.|
|||
|**Infrastructure Development**|**Trans-Amazonian Highway, Brazil**: Facilitated access to remote areas, leading to deforestation.|
|||
|**Global Demand for Commodities**|**Palm Oil Predicament, Malaysia & Indonesia**: High palm oil demand drives extensive deforestation.|
|||
|**Climate Change Pressures**|[**Amazon’s Tipping Point**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/10/06/40-of-the-amazon-rainforest-is-at-tipping-point-to-becoming-savanna/)**:** Increased climate stress risks forest dieback and widespread deforestation.|
|||
|**Policy and Governance**|**Congo Basin Crisis:** Weak governance contributes to extensive deforestation in the Congo Basin.|
|||
|**Sociocultural Factors**|**Indonesia’s Indigenous Communities**: Displacement for palm oil plantations leads to deforestation.|
|**The demise of the Adivasis, India**: Displacement and loss of traditional forest management knowledge cause deforestation.|

**What is** [**Forest Restoration**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Forest-Restoration.pdf)**?**

Forest restoration involves the **deliberate and planned process of restoring and regenerating forests** that have been degraded, damaged, or lost due to various human activities or natural causes. This process aims to **return a forest ecosystem to a healthier and more natural state**, often involving tree planting, habitat restoration, and sustainable management practices to improve biodiversity, ecosystem services, and overall forest health.

**India’s Pledge:**

India aims to restore **21 million hectares of forest by 2030** through the [**Bonn Challenge**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/06/18/forest-landscape-restoration-flr-and-bonn-challenge/). In 2018, a report by the government and the IUCN indicated **10 million hectares** were under restoration. **India’s national forest policy targets 33% tree coverage**.

**Status of forest restoration:**

- According to the [International Union for Conservation of Nature](https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/international-conventions/#:~:text=The%20International%20Union%20for%20Conservation,sustainable%20use%20of%20natural%20resources.) (IUCN), deforestation and **forest degradation contribute to around 12%** of global greenhouse gas emissions.
- **30% of forestland is degraded in India**. The total area occupied by primary forests in India has decreased by **6%.**

**Current Approach to Restoration:**

The current global focus on **tree planting has often led to the rapid establishment of fast-growing** tree plantations e.g. Miyawaki Method; **fast-growing single species like eucalyptus or bamboo** to quickly increase tree cover. This approach can yield quick results but also **poses risks, including invasive species and land dispossession**.

**India’s Tree Planting Experiments:**

India has conducted **tree planting experiments for over 200 years**, offering valuable lessons about different approaches to forest restoration and their consequences on local communities and the environment.

**Lessons from India:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Lessons**|**Examples from India’s Experience**|
|**The Importance of Diverse Restoration Approaches**|**Positive Case**: The Forest Rights Act of 2006 empowered village assemblies (Gram Sabhas) in **central India’s Gadchiroli district** to restore degraded forests, sustainably **utilizing tendu leaves** for bidi (Indian tobacco).|
|In western **India’s Kachchh grasslands**, communities successfully restored the ecosystem by removing the invasive “**gando bawal” tree**, introduced by British foresters in the late 19th century.|
|**Balancing Tree Planting with Ecosystem Impact**|**Negative Case**: The introduction **of non-native species like wattle, pine, and acacia disrupted ecosystems**, leading to resource loss and community hardships.|
|**Considering the Impact on Local Communities**|**Negative Case:** British colonial **restrictions on local forest use** led to conflicts, including communities burning down forests in retaliation.|
|**Measuring Success Beyond Tree Quantity**|**Positive Case**: Measuring success by the well-being of people and ecosystems, rather than just tree quantity, ensures a more comprehensive view of restoration outcomes.|
|**Sustainable Management for Long-Term Benefits**|**Positive Case:** Communities **managing forests sustainably**, like in Gadchiroli and Kachchh, demonstrate the **long-term benefits of responsible forest restoration.**|

**Further Actions Needed:**

- [**Forest Landscape Restoration**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/07/09/forest-landscape-restoration/): Implement forest landscape restoration to restore ecological functionality and enhance human welfare in deforested or degraded forest landscapes, involving communities, governments, and vulnerable forest-dependent individuals.
- **Diverse Tree Species**: Prioritize planting diverse native tree species in reforestation efforts. Natural forests with varied species are more effective at carbon sequestration than monoculture plantations.
    - For instance, in Punjab, native species like Jhand, Desi Kikar, and Pharwan have high survival rates.
- **Promote** [**Agroforestry**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/environment-degradation-and-issues/forest-ecosystem/governmental-institutions-for-forest-conservation/agroforestry/#:~:text=Agroforestry%20is%20a%20type%20of,grown%20on%20the%20farmers'%20land.): Encourage sustainable forest crops through agroforestry, which enhances food security, empowers women, and boosts household income, reducing rural-to-urban migration.
- **Holistic Well-being:** Recognize that tree planting contributes to the holistic well-being of individuals, communities, and the planet.

**Key Government Initiatives:**

**International Initiatives:**

- [**UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/06/global-land-outlook-report/#:~:text=UN%20Decade%20on%20Ecosystem%20Restoration,26%20million%20hectares%20by%202030.) **(2021-2030):** Focuses on restoring degraded terrestrial ecosystems, including forests.
- **Bonn Challenge**: Aims to restore 350 million hectares of landscapes by 2030. India pledged to restore 21 million hectares and create a carbon sink of 2.5-3 billion tonnes by 2030.

**Indian Programs:**

- Compensatory Afforestation
- National Afforestation Programme
- [National Mission for a Green India](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/02/03/green-india-mission-2/#:~:text=GIM%20is%20one%20of%20the,of%20adaptation%20and%20mitigation%20measures.) (Green India Mission)
- [Nagar Van Scheme](https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/welfare-schemes/schemes-under-ministry-of-environment-forests/nagar-van-scheme/#:~:text=About%20Nagar%20Van%20scheme,states%20to%20manage%20urban%20ecosystems.)
- Hariyali Mahotsav and Van Mahotsav
- Forest Fire Prevention and Management Scheme
- **Green Skill Development Programme** for youth in the environment and forest sectors.
- **State Initiatives** (Telangana): **‘Telanganaku Haritha Haram’** large-scale tree planting program, utilizing drones for efficient implementation.

**Conclusion:**

Successful forest restoration must consider its impact on forest rights, local livelihoods, biodiversity, and carbon storage. The choice of plantation species should prevent invasiveness, and a broader view of success is needed beyond tree cover alone.

### [Heat index](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/09/07/heat-index-3/)

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/explained-what-is-heat-index-and-why-is-it-important-to-measure/article67226405.ece)

 **Context:** Recently**, Iran** recorded a **scorching heat index** of **70 degrees Celsius (°C)** in the coastal part of the country.

- The heat index, also known as **apparent temperature**, is a crucial indicator that measures how the **temperature feels to humans based on a combination of air temperature and relative humidity**.
- It provides a **more accurate representation of how hot the weather actually feels compared to just the air temperature.**

**About** [**Heat Index**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/22/heat-index-2/#:~:text=The%20Heat%20Index%20is%20designed,humidity%2C%20causing%20discomfort%20for%20people.)**:**

The heat index is calculated **using a complex formula that considers factors such as air temperature, relative humidity, and dew point**.  The dew point, the **temperature at which air becomes saturated with moisture** and **forms dew, is a critical component in this calculation.**

 Various countries have their own heat index measurement systems. For instance, **Canada uses the Humidex, and the U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) has its own heat index chart.**

**Why measure the Heat Index?**

- The importance of measuring the heat index lies in its **ability to assess the impact of heat on human health and well-being**. High humidity during heatwaves can make the apparent temperature significantly higher than the actual air temperature, making it feel much hotter to people.
- High heat index **values can lead to heat stress, heat exhaustion, and even heatstroke, posing serious health risks.** Monitoring the heat index is **vital for public safety, especially during extreme heat events.**
- It helps **authorities issue heat wave alerts, implement necessary precautions, and adapt to extreme heat conditions** by adjusting **work schedules and providing cooling solutions to protect public health and safety.**

 **Context:** Several Indian banks, have initiated **interoperability** between the [**Unified Payments Interface’s**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/08/12/rbi-launches-new-features-for-upi/#:~:text=A%20unified%20payment%20system%20(UPI,National%20Payments%20Corporation%20of%20India.) **(UPI) Quick Response (QR) codes and their** [**central bank digital currency**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/science-technology/communication-and-it-technology/central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc/#:~:text=A%20Central%20Bank%20Digital%20Currency,and%20credit%20of%20the%20government.) **(CBDC) or e₹ applications**.

- This integration allows users of the **retail digital rupee to perform transactions by scanning any UPI QR code at a merchant outlet,** simplifying payments for customers and merchants.

 The digital rupee, issued by the RBI, is a tokenized digital version of the rupee, stored in a digital wallet linked to a customer’s savings bank account.

This move aims to **increase the adoption of the digital rupee by leveraging the widespread use of UPI**.

**About Interoperability:** 

**As** defined by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), it **enables a payment system to work seamlessly with other payment systems**. In this context, it means **that all UPI QR codes are compatible with CBDC apps, eliminating the need for separate QR codes for transactions**.

 **Context:** A **recent analysis indicates that 11 high-income countries**, including **Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom**, may require over **two centuries to achieve a 95% reduction in their 2022 greenhouse gas emissions.**

- The study, published in **The Lancet Planetary Health**, highlights that if current trends persist, these nations would **emit 27 times their fair share of the 1.5 degrees Celsius carbon budget defined by the Paris Agreement.**
- The researchers found that **“green growth” is unattainable** for these high-income countries, and their pursuit of **economic growth contradicts the climate and equity goals of the Paris Agreement**.
- The study emphasizes that there is **nothing environmentally friendly about the economic growth in these countries, and the term “green growth” is misleading, akin to greenwashing**.

**Solution suggested:**

To achieve emissions reductions in line with the Paris Agreement, these nations should adopt a **“post-growth” approach**, focusing on **equitable reductions in carbon-intensive production and consumption while enhancing livelihoods and well-being through policies like public job guarantees,** reduced work hours, living wages, minimum income guarantees, and universal access to affordable housing and quality public services.
