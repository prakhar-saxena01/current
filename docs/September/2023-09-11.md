### [Progress on the Sustainable Development Goals: The gender snapshot 2023](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/09/11/progress-on-the-sustainable-development-goals-the-gender-snapshot-2023/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

 **Syllabus: Government Policies and Interventions/ Social Justice**

**Source:** [**UN Women**](https://www.unwomen.org/en/news-stories/press-release/2023/09/press-release-the-world-is-failing-girls-and-women-according-to-new-un-report)

**Context:** The latest UN report titled **“Progress on the** [**Sustainable Development Goals**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/01/editorial-analysis-india-its-sdg-pledge-goal-and-the-strategy-to-apply/)**: The gender snapshot 2023**” reveals that despite global efforts, the world is failing to **achieve** [**gender equality**](http://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Gender-Equality-in-India.pdf)**.**

**What is** [**Gender Equality**](http://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Gender-Equality-in-India.pdf)**?**

Gender equality refers to the **equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals, regardless of their gender**. It involves ensuring that women and men have the **same access to resources, education, employment**, and decision-making processes. G

**Key findings from the report include:**

- **Social aspects**:
    - **SDG 1 (No Poverty**): If current trends continue, **over 340 million women and girls** (about 8% of the female population) will live in **extreme poverty by 2030**
    - **SDG 2 (Zero Hunger):** One in four experiencing food insecurity.
    - **Older women face higher rates** of poverty and violence than older men, with many lacking access to pensions.
    - **Violence**: No country is within reach of eradicating intimate partner violence
    - The number of women and girls in **conflict-affected contexts has risen** significantly
- **Political aspects**: Gender disparities **persist in power and leadership roles**
- **SDG 5 (Gender Equality):** Women spend **2.****3 more hours per day on unpaid care** and domestic work than men.
- **SDG 13 (Climate Action):** Climate change may push about 158 million more women and girls into poverty by mid-century.
- **Progress on SDG:** Progress on **SDG 5 (gender equality)** is **significantly off track**, with only two indicators nearing the target.
- **Finance aspect:** An additional $360 billion per year is needed to achieve gender equality and women’s empowerment across global goals.
    - **Wage Gap:** The **labour and earnings gap remains persistently high**. For each dollar men earn in labour income globally, women earn only 51 cents.

**Persistent Challenges**: Challenges include **food insecurity due to climate change, insufficient efforts** to combat intimate partner violence, rising conflict-affected contexts for women and girls, a significant number of girls and young women out of school, and persistent earnings gaps between men and women in the labour force.

**Recommendations**:

The report calls for **greater collaboration, funding, and policy actions to address gender disparities and emphasizes** that failing to prioritize gender equality could jeopardize the entire 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Addressing **gender gaps in agrifood systems** can reduce food insecurity and boost global GDP by nearly $1 trillion.

### [Management of electronic waste (e-waste) in India](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/09/11/management-of-electronic-waste-e-waste-in-india/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus: Environment Conservation**

**Source:** [**Th**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/explained-what-should-be-done-with-electronic-waste/article67289789.ece)

 **Context:** The Indian Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA) released a report on **‘Pathways to Circular Economy in Indian Electronics Sector’** in collaboration with [NITI Aayog](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/06/08/niti-aayog/), aiming to explore **opportunities for managing** [**electronic waste (e-waste)**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/environment-pollution-and-control/waste-management/e-waste/) **more effectively.**

**What is** [**E-waste**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/environment-pollution-and-control/waste-management/e-waste/)**?**

**E-waste** refers to all items of electronic and electrical equipment (EEE) and its parts that have been discarded by their owner as waste without the intent of re-use.

**Status of E-Wastes in India:**

- India is the t**hird-largest e-waste generator** in the world after **China** and the **USA (**[**Global E-waste Monitor 2020**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/10/19/international-e-waste-day/)).
- E-waste management in India is predominantly informal, **with roughly 90% of collection** and **70% of recycling handled** by the informal sector.
- **The level of e-waste is expected to grow** due to cheaper phones and increased usage.

In November 2022, the **Ministry of Environment and Forests** notified the [**E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2022**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/11/11/government-notified-e-waste-management-rules-2022/), (which came into force on **April 1, 2023**) to digitize the e-waste management process and provide more transparency in handling e-waste.

**Provisions of the** [**E-Waste (Management) Rules 2022**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/11/11/government-notified-e-waste-management-rules-2022/)**:**

- **Restricted the use of hazardous substances** (such as lead, mercury, and cadmium) in manufacturing electrical and electronic equipment that have an adverse impact on human health and the environment.
- **Increased coverage:** It has increased the range of electronic goods covered e.g., laptops, mobile, cameras etc.
- **Targets fixed:** Producers of electronic goods have to ensure at least 60% of their electronic waste is collected and recycled by 2023 with targets to increase them to **70% and 80% in 2024 and 2025**, respectively.
    - Companies will report these on an online portal.
- [**Extended Producer Responsibility**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/02/21/extended-producers-responsibility-on-plastic-packaging/) **Certificates** (similar to carbon credit mechanism): This will allow the offsetting of e-waste responsibility to a third party.
- **‘Environmental compensation’** to be provided by the companies that don’t meet their target.
- **Role of State Governments:** They will earmark industrial space for e-waste dismantling and recycling facilities, undertaking **industrial skill development** and establishing measures for protecting the **health and safety of workers** engaged in the dismantling and recycling facilities for e-waste.
- **Role of manufacturers:**
    - Make the end product recyclable
    - A component made by different manufacturers be compatible with each other
- **Monitoring: The Central Pollution Control Board** shall conduct random sampling of electrical and electronic equipment placed on the market to monitor and verify the compliance of reduction of hazardous substances provisions.

**Recommendations of the Report:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Recommendation**|**Examples**|
|**Encourage manufacturers to reuse old components**|China targets 5% of secondary raw material in new products by 2019 and aims for 35% by 2030.|
|**Establish public-private partnerships for a reverse supply chain**|Collect devices from users, wipe personal data, and recycle them.|
|**Create an auditable database of collected materials**|Maintain a transparent record of materials collected for accountability.|
|**Develop geographical clusters for processing devices**|Concentrate devices in specific areas for efficient dismantling and recycling.|
|**Incentivize high-yield recycling centres**|Promote facilities capable of extracting maximum value from e-waste, such as rare earth metals in semiconductors.|
|**Support the right to repair by users**|Encourage product repair and longevity to reduce electronic waste.|

**Case study:**

 **The Bhopal e-waste clinic,** a pilot project, exemplifies this approach. It enables door-to-door collection or direct deposit at the clinic, offering a fee-based exchange. Its success warrants further study.

**Best practice:**

 **‘Karo Sambhav’,** a Delhi-based PRO, has integrated informal aggregators in its collection mechanism → e-waste entered a safe and structured system → informal sector has an advantage in terms of financial and legal security.

**IIT Hyderabad launched M.Tech courses in e-waste Resources.**

**Conclusion**:

Efforts to **create a circular economy for e-waste** are crucial, given the unpredictable supply chains for electronic components, and the need to extract the full value of electronics in a formalized and reliable manner.

**What is** [**Hallmarking?**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/05/03/what-is-hallmarking-of-gold/)

Hallmarking is like a quality stamp for jewellery and precious metal items. It tells you how pure or good the metal is.

The principal **objectives of the Hallmarking Scheme** are to protect the public against adulteration and to obligate manufacturers to **maintain legal standards of fineness**.

**Hallmarking in India:**

- At present two precious metals **namely gold and silver** have been brought under the purview of Hallmarking.
- Mandatory hallmarking order is applicable on **14, 18 and 22 carats of gold jewellery**/artefacts only.
- BIS assigns a **unique HUID (Hallmarking Unique ID) number** to all hallmarked items
- Consumers can verify the authenticity of hallmarked items using the **‘verify HUID’ feature** in the BIS Care app.

**What is the Hallmarking scheme?**

Under the Hallmarking scheme of the [**Bureau of Indian Standards(BIS**),](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/02/22/one-nation-one-standard-mission/) Jewellers are registered for **selling hallmarked jewellery** and recognised testing and hallmarking centres.

**Mandatory Hallmarking of Gold Jewellery**: Mandatory Hallmarking of Gold Jewellery has come into force from June 2021. In the first phase, mandatory hallmarking was implemented **in 256 districts of the country** with effect from 23 June 2021 and in the second phase additional 32 districts were covered.

**Aim of the scheme:**

- To **protect consumers against victimization** due to irregular gold or silver quality
- **Develop India as a leading gold market** centre in the World and develop export competitiveness

 **Context: Scientists in China** have uncovered fossils of a peculiar, **bird-like dinosaur named Fujianvenator prodigiosus**, which lived around **148 to 150 million years ago** in **southeast China.**

- This dinosaur had **long legs and arms** resembling wings, with an **unusual anatomy suggesting it may have been a fast runner or lived like a modern wading bird.**
- Researchers believe that **Fujianvenator sheds light on a critical evolutionary stage in the origin of birds.**

**Features:**

- It is **described as a “bizarre” animal with bird-like features** but significant differences, such as three claws on its wing-like forelimb.
- **Fujianvenator’s** discovery **contributes to our understanding of the evolutionary history of birds,** which evolved from **two-legged, feathered dinosaurs** known as theropods during the late Jurassic period.
- The fossils are **relatively complete but lack the skull and parts of the feet**, making it challenging to determine their **exact lifestyle and diet**.
- Notably, **its lower leg bone (tibia) was unusually long compared to its thigh bone (femur**), a feature distinct from other theropods like Tyrannosaurus.

 **Context:** Researchers have made a **rare discovery of a “white” sambar deer** with a condition called **leucism**, resulting in **white or pale skin**, in the **Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary in Karnataka, India.**

- Leucism is a **genetic condition** that affects the **pigmentation of an animal’s skin, feathers, scales, or fur**. Unlike albinism, which causes a complete absence of pigment, **leucism results in a partial loss of pigment, leading to white or pale colouration in affected areas**.

**About Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary:** 

This sanctuary spans **three districts** and serves as a crucial connection between **Bannerghatta National Park in the north and Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple Tiger Reserve and Male Mahadeshwara Hills Wildlife Sanctuary in the south**.

Timor-Leste is a **Southeast Asian nation occupying half the island of Timor** and is ringed by coral reefs teeming with marine life. It comprises the **eastern half of the island of Timor**, of which the **western half is administered by** [**Indonesia**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/international-relations/bilateral-regional-and-global-groupings-and-agreements-involving-india-and-or-affecting-indias-interests/india-and-south-east-and-east-asia/india-indonesia/), the exclave of Oecusse on the island’s north-western half, and the minor islands of Atauro and Jaco. Australia is the country’s southern neighbour, separated by the Timor Sea.

**Timor-Leste was a Portuguese colony until 1975,** followed by Indonesian rule after the conflict. In 1999, it gained independence through a UN-sponsored act and became the 1st sovereign state of the 21st century (in 2002)
