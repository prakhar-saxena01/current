The Red Sea route refers to an **ancient maritime trade route that connected India with the Roman Empire through the Red Sea**.

- This route facilitated the **exchange of various goods, including luxuries like spices, ivory, pearls, gemstones**, and pepper from India to the Roman Empire.

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/red_sea_route.jpg)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/red_sea_route.jpg)

**About the Red Sea Route:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**About**|**Details**|
|**Indian Trade Contribution to the Roman Empire’s Income**|Custom taxes from Red Sea trade may have covered **one-third of Roman income**|
|**Trade Goods Exchanged**|Luxuries, spices, ivory, pearls, precious gemstones, pepper, wild animals, and more|
|**Importance of Indian Pepper**|**Pepper** was India’s major export and was highly sought after in Rome|
|**Importance of the route**||
|**Chinese silk reached Rome** through India’s ports, emphasizing India’s historical importance|
|Recent excavations in places like **Muziris and Berenike** have contributed to understanding the trade|
|**India’s centrality in trade** and the spread of ideas during the 1st and 2nd centuries CE is recognized|

**About Red Sea:**

 The Red Sea is an inlet of the Indian Ocean located between Africa and Asia. It is one of the most saline bodies of water globally. Bordering countries include **Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Sudan, Eritrea, and Djibouti.** It connects to the Indian Ocean in the south through the Bab el Mandeb Strait and the Gulf of Aden. In the north, it is bordered by the Sinai Peninsula, the Gulf of Aqaba, and the Gulf of Suez, leading to the Suez Canal. The Red Sea occupies a part of the Great Rift Valley, known as the **Afro-Arabian Rift Valley**.

**Why is it called “Red Sea”?** 

**The Red Sea** is not red in appearance; it typically has **blue-green water.** One theory suggests that a **cyanobacteria called Trichodesmium erythraeum**, a **red-colored** algae, may occasionally turn the **water reddish-brown during seasonal algal blooms**. Another theory links the name to **Asiatic languages that use colours to denote cardinal directions**, with “**red**” possibly representing “**south**.”

### [India’s falling cotton production](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/09/12/indias-falling-cotton-production/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus: Cropping Pattern/ Agriculture**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/why-indias-falling-cotton-production-is-a-worry-8933909/)

 **Context:** The article highlights the current issues with India’s [cotton production](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/30/the-green-in-our-weaves-sustainable-cotton-textiles/).

**About Cotton:**

Cotton is a versatile crop known for its **white fluffy fibre, oil-rich seeds, and protein-rich seed** cake. It has various uses, including textiles, cooking oil, and livestock feed.

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/cotton_1.png)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/cotton_1.png)

**Significance of Cotton in India:**

- **Triple Role:** Cotton in India provides food, feed, and fibre, making it a crucial crop for agriculture and the textile sector.
- **Cotton Components:** After harvesting cotton (Kapas), the breakdown is approximately **36% fibre, 62% seeds, and 2% waste**.
    - **Cottonseed** is essential for vegetable oil and feed cake production.
- **Market Contribution:** Cottonseed oil is the **third-largest domestically produced** vegetable oil in India, following **mustard and soyabean**. It also ranks second in feed cake production, with soybeans leading.
- **Textile Dominance:** Cotton is the dominant fibre in **India’s textile industry**, accounting for about two-thirds of the total consumption.

**The impact of Bt technology on cotton production in India:**

- **Introduction** [**to Bt Technology**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/06/18/bt-cotton/) **(2002)**: India adopted genetically modified (GM) cotton hybrids embedded with genes from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) bacterium, which were toxic to certain pests.
- **Significant Boost in Production and Yield**: Between 2000-01 and 2013-14, Bt cotton led to a **remarkable increase in cotton production**, from **140 lakh to 398 lakh bales**, and a doubling of lint yields per hectare from **278 kg to 566 kg**.
    - **Lint** is the fluffy, white fibre of cotton that is used for textiles and fabric production.
- **Subsequent Yield Decline:** However, post-2013-14, cotton production and yields started declining, reaching about 343 lakh bales and 447 kg/hectare by 2022-23.

**Reasons for the decline of cotton Production in India:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Reason**|**Impact on Cotton Production in India**|
|**Development of** [**Pink Bollworm (PBW)**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2018/04/04/insights-into-editorial-a-perfect-storm-in-the-cotton-field/) **Resistance to Bt Cotton**|Initially, Bt cotton protected against pests like the **American bollworm and pink bollworm.** But by 2014, pink bollworms developed resistance to Bt proteins, causing widespread infestations and yield reductions.|
|**Shift from Non-Bt Cotton Cultivation**|Decreased diversity in cotton varieties increased the scale of infestation.|
|**Pest Infestation Discouraging Farmers**|Farmers in some states, like Punjab, avoid cotton cultivation.|
|**Ineffectiveness of Traditional Insecticides**|Conventional insecticides had limited efficacy against PBW larvae, affecting lint quality and yields.|

**Solutions to control the Pink Bollworm (PBW):**

- **Mating Disruption as a Solution:** “Mating disruption” uses synthetic versions of pheromones to confuse male PBW moths, preventing them from mating with females.
    - Products like **PBKnot and SPLAT** were approved for this purpose.

**Government initiatives for the Cotton sector in India:**

- [Amended Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme](https://www.insightsonindia.com/tag/technical-upgradation-fund-scheme/) (ATUFS)
- Market Access Initiative (MAI) Scheme
- [**SAMARTH**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/welfare-schemes/schemes-under-ministry-of-textiles/samarth-scheme/) (Scheme for Capacity Building in the Textile Sector)
- Mega Investment Textiles Parks ([**MITRA**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/10/08/pm-mitra-scheme/))
- [**Production Linked Incentive**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/15/production-linked-incentive-pli-schemes/#:~:text=In%20the%20PLI%20Scheme%2C%20companies,and%20boost%20the%20country's%20economy.) **(PLI) Scheme**to promote the production of MMF Apparel, MMF Fabrics and Products of Technical Textiles

[**The textile sector in India**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/tag/indian-textiles-sector/)**:** 

India **is one of the largest consumers and producers of cotton and jute** in the world. 95% of the **world’s hand-woven fabric comes from India**.

It is the **2nd largest employment provider after agriculture**. India is 2nd largest manufacturer of **PPE and producer of polyester, silk and fibre** in the world.

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/new-currency-next-steps-8933822/)

 **Context:** The article highlights the differences in cryptocurrency regulations worldwide.

**What is** [**cryptocurrency**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/science-technology/communication-and-it-technology/cryptocurrency/) **and how it is different from Central bank currencies?**

Cryptocurrency is a **digital or virtual form of currency that uses cryptography** for security. It operates on **decentralized technology called blockchain**, which records all transactions transparently.

**Unlike** [**central bank currencies**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/science-technology/communication-and-it-technology/central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc/#:~:text=A%20Central%20Bank%20Digital%20Currency,and%20credit%20of%20the%20government.) **(fiat currencies),** cryptocurrencies are **not issued or regulated by a central authority like a government or central bank**. They are **decentralized**, **borderless**, and typically have limited supply, making them immune to government manipulation and often subject to price volatility.

**The current regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in India:**

- **In 2018, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)** banned Indian banks from engaging in cryptocurrency transactions.
- **In 2020, the Supreme Court of India overturned** the RBI’s ban on cryptocurrency transactions.
- **In the 2022-23 Union budget, India proposed a 30% tax** on income generated from digital asset transfers and a **1% Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on cryptocurrency**

**The major view of the IMF and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) paper on cryptocurrencies:**

- **Difficulty in Banning Cryptocurrencies**: Banning cryptocurrencies may not be an effective option as it could lead to activities shifting to **more crypto-friendly jurisdictions and push transactions** outside a country’s oversight, raising financial risks.
- **Regulation Over Ban:** The paper suggests that supervising **licensed crypto-asset issuers and service providers** can help fill information gaps and facilitate the monitoring of cross-border crypto activities.
- **Anti-money Laundering Standards**: It recommends implementing the **Financial Action Task Force’s standard**s to combat money laundering and terrorist financing related to cryptocurrencies.

The G20 Leaders Declaration **endorsed the FSB’s recommendations** and welcomed the paper’s roadmap for **a coordinated and comprehensive policy** and regulatory framework.

**About FSB:**

**The** [**Financial Stability Board**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/tag/financial-stability-board-fsb/) **(founded in 2009; HQ: Basel, Switzerland)** is an international body that **monitors and makes recommendations** about the global financial system. It was established after the G20 London summit (2009) as a successor to the **Financial Stability Forum.**

 **Context**: Indian scientists are gearing up for an ambitious project called [**Samudrayaan**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/09/02/samudrayaan-project/), which involves **sending three people 6,000 meters underwater in a domestically developed submersible named Matsya 6000**.

- This mission aims to **explore the ocean depths** of precious metals and minerals such as cobalt, nickel, and manganese.

**About Matsya 6000:**

Matsya 6000 has been in **development for nearly two years and will undergo its first sea trials in the Bay of Benga**l off the Chennai coast in early 2024. The submersible’s design has been reviewed carefully, **taking into account materials, testing, certification, redundancy, and standard operating procedures.**

The submersible’s **design includes a 2.1-meter diameter sphere made of 80mm-thick titanium alloy,** capable of **withstanding the immense pressure at 6,000 meters depth,** which is 600 times greater than sea level pressure. **The vehicle is designed to operate continuously for 12 to 16 hours, with a 96-hour oxygen supply.**

**About Mission Samudrayaan:**

- The **Samudrayaan mission is part of the Deep Ocean Mission**, and sea trials at a **depth of 500 meters are planned for the first quarter of 2024**. The mission’s full realization **is expected by 2026.**
- It’s **worth noting that only a few countries, including the US, Russia, Japan, France, and China**, have developed manned submersibles.
- In addition to searching for valuable minerals like nickel, cobalt, and manganese, Matsya 6000 will investigate the **chemosynthetic biodiversity in hydrothermal vents and low-temperature methane seeps in the ocean**.

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/mosquito-control-gene-drive-technology-benefits-risks/article67287784.ece)

**Context:** [Genetic engineering](https://www.insightsonindia.com/science-technology/biotechnology/gene-editing/) is being used to **upgrade mosquito control efforts** due to the ongoing **threat of mosquito-borne diseases.**

- Recent advancements in **genome sequencing technology** have **provided researchers with access to mosquito genomes, particularly Anopheles stephensi**, a major malaria vector mosquito.
- Genetic manipulation, including **gene-drive technology, is employed to control mosquito populations by interfering with their reproduction.**

**Gene-drive technology**, originally conceived by Austin Burt in 2003**, alters mosquito DNA to reduce their reproductive capabilities or make them sterile,** preventing the transmission of diseases like malaria. Some approaches involve **enhancing genes in mosquitoes to produce antimicrobial substances, disrupting disease transmission.**

**Genetically modified mosquitoes, such as OX5034**, have been released in **certain areas to reduce mosquito populations,** showing promising results in decreasing disease incidence. However, these technologies come with potential risks, such as **ecological disruptions and unintended consequences in the ecosystem.**

### [New Central Empowered Committee (CEC) for Environmental Issues](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/09/12/new-central-empowered-committee-cec-for-environmental-issues/)

**Source:** [**The New Indian Express**](https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2023/sep/08/centre-sets-up-new-committee-to-replace-scs-watchdog-panel-on-forest-environmental-issues-2612921.html)

**Context:** The **Union Environment Ministry** has established a **new Central Empowered Committee (CEC)** to replace **an ad hoc expert panel** with the same name that has been **assisting the Supreme Court on forest and environmental issues since 2002.**

- This move has **raised concerns about the committee’s independence under government control.**

Under the new structure, the **CEC will consist of a chairperson, a member secretary, and three expert members, all appointed by the Union government**. The chairperson must have **at least 25 years of experience in environmental, forestry, or wildlife fields** or substantial administrative expertise in government, serving a maximum term of three years.

**Need for restructuring:**

- The restructuring of the **CEC comes following the passage of the** [**Forest Conservation (Amendment) Bill, 2023**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/06/forest-conservation-amendment-bill-2023/)**,** which **some critics believe weakens existing safeguards in Indian forest law, potentially facilitating construction projects in ecologically sensitive regions**.
- This change in the committee’s composition has raised questions about its **ability to function independently and issue impartial judgments,** given that its members will now all be civil servants appointed by the government.
