#### **GS Paper 3**

 **Syllabus: Science and Technology**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/hingoli-ligo-us-laser-gravitational-project-chandrayaan-premium-8919363/)

 **Context:** [LIGO-India](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/08/ligo-india-2/#:~:text=Context%3A%20LIGO%2DIndia%2C%20a,Hingoli%20district%20of%20Maharashtra%2C%20India.), part of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, is set to **become a prominent astronomical observatory** in the world, aiming to detect and study gravitational waves, offering a new way to observe the universe.

**What are** [**Gravitational Waves**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/01/gravitational-vibrations/#:~:text=Context%3A%20Scientists%20have%20found%20evidence,collision%20of%20two%20black%20holes.)**?**

Gravitational waves are **ripples in the fabric of space and time** that travel at the speed of light. They are **created by the motion of massive objects**, such as black holes or neutron stars, which **generate gravitational waves** when they orbit or collide with each other.

**The science behind Gravitational waves:**

According to [**Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativity**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/25/unifying-quantum-theory-and-general-relativity/) **(1916)**, any object with mass warps the space-time around it. When two massive objects orbit each other or collide, they produce **ripples or waves in space-time** that propagate outward at the speed of light.

**Why use LIGO?**

Gravitational waves are **extremely weak and difficult to detect**. They were first directly detected by the **Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (**[**LIGO**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/01/09/laser-interferometer-gravitational-wave-observatory-ligo-project/)**) in 2015**, a century after they were predicted by Einstein’s theory.

- The court made this ruling based on **findings of corrupt practices during the election process**.

The court found that the member **had engaged in numerous election corrupt practices**, including **providing false information about the value of his assets**, **concealing his actual bank balance, failing to disclose a loan, and not submitting income-tax returns for relevant periods**.

[**Representation of the People Act (RPA), 1951**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/salient-features-of-the-representation-of-peoples-act/) enables the **High Court to declare an election void on certain grounds (Conviction of certain offences, Corrupt practices, Failing to declare election expenses, Interests in government contracts or works).** The aggrieved person can appeal to **the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court.**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/children-born-out-of-void-voidable-marriages-have-right-on-parents-ancestral-property-sc-8920260/)

 **Context:** The Supreme Court has ruled that **children born from void or voidable marriages** have the **right to claim a share of their parents’ ancestral property**.

- However, this right is **limited to their parents’ share within the Hindu Undivided Family (HUF)** governed by **Mitakshara Law** and **does not extend to the entire HUF’s property.**
- It emphasized that **these children would be considered legitimate and related by legitimate kinship under the** [**Hindu Succession Act (HSA), 1956.**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/08/17/insights-into-editorial-seal-of-justice/)
- **Section 16(3) of the HMA, 1955** explicitly states that the conferment of legitimacy does not grant any rights to the property of anyone other than the parents.

**About Mitakshara Law:**

The **Mitakshara school of Hindu law** is a well-known school of thought that specifies procedures for **succession and inheritance**. The Mitakshara school of thought **states that a son, grandson, and great-grandson have a right to family property through birth**.

The Mitakshara School of Law is followed in every state in India, **except for West Bengal and Assam. The Hindu Succession Act of 1956 governs Hindu family law.** 

Before the [**2005 amendment of the Hindu Succession Act**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/08/12/supreme-court-verdict-on-hindu-womens-inheritance-rights/), a **female could not be a coparcener and was not entitled to partition.**

**Context:** The **Delhi High Court** has allowed **two children with** [**autism**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/17/sansad-tv-perspective-living-with-autism-2/) **spectrum disorder (ASD)** to **undergo** [**stem cell therapy**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/science-technology/biotechnology/stem-cells/) for their condition.

- **This is overturning a previous recommendation** by the **Ethics and Medical Registration Board (EMRB) of the National Medical Commission (NMC) against the use of stem cell treatment for autism spectrum disorder.**
- The EMRB recommended against the use of stem cell therapy for ASD due to concerns about **“predatory marketing” and false hope**, as well as the **lack of a well-established protocol for its use.**

Stem cells are cells from which **all other cells in the body, with specialized functions, are generated.** There are two main categories: **pluripotent stem cells**, which can **differentiate into any cell type in the adult body,** and **adult stem cells,** which are **tissue-specific and can only generate cells for a particular organ.**

Stem cells have been used in medicine, **particularly in regenerative medicine, for over 90 years.** Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, for instance, is used to treat conditions like **leukaemia and lymphoma,** where healthy stem cells are introduced to replace damaged cells.

**Autism spectrum disorder** is a **neurological and developmental disorder affecting communication, behaviour, and learning**. While there is no cure for ASD, **various therapies are used to manage symptoms and improve the individual’s quality of life**.

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/world/study-finds-fish-surprisingly-resistant-to-marine-heatwaves-91502)

 **Context:**  A recent study conducted by **researchers from Canada, Europe, and the United States** reveals that **fish are surprisingly resilient to** [**marine heatwaves**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/02/09/what-are-marine-heatwaves/).

**Key Findings:**

- The study found **no substantial evidence that marine heatwaves have a significant impact on regional fish communities.**
- The study also investigated **whether marine heatwaves caused changes in fish community composition,** such as shifts from **cold-water species to warm-water species** (known as “**tropicalisation**“). However, **no consistent pattern of such changes was observed due to marine heat waves.**

Marine heatwaves, characterized by **prolonged periods of warm ocean temperatures**, can have **devastating effects on marine ecosystems**, including **coral bleaching, seabird deaths, harmful algal blooms, and more**.

Several Southeast Asian countries, including the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Taiwan, have joined India in rejecting **China’s new national map and 9 Dashed Line in the South China Sea**.

India specifically protested **China’s claims over Arunachal Pradesh and Aksai Chin**

**What is a** [**Nine-dash line**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/03/31/south-china-sea-dispute-5/)**?**

The nine-dash line is a **historical demarcation line on a map used by China** to assert territorial claims in the **South China Sea**.

China asserts a claim to **90% of the South China Sea**, primarily based on the **historical U-shaped nine-dash line drawn on a map** in the 1940s and encompassing several islands, notably the **Paracels and Spratlys.**

However, the [**Permanent Court of Arbitration under UNCLOS**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/08/permanent-court-of-arbitration/#:~:text=The%20PCA%20has%20a%20three,led%20by%20the%20Secretary%2DGeneral.) (United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea) has determined that **China’s claim in this region lacks a legal foundation**

 **Context:** The Director General of Foreign Trade emphasized the **government’s commitment to enhanced** [**export control of dual-use items**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/11/export-control/) to prevent them from falling into the hands of **non-state actors and terrorists**.

**What are Dual-use items?**

They are **products, technologies, materials, or equipment** that can have both civilian and military or non-military applications. These items are designed or intended primarily for civilian purposes **but can also be used for military or other prohibited purposes**.

- Examples: precursor chemicals like sarin gas; Components like centrifuges

Currently, **the Directorate General of Foreign Trade** (DGFT) prepares a specialized **SCOMET** (speciality chemicals, organisms, materials, equipment, and technologies) list of dual-use items and these items are regulated as per [**India’s Foreign Trade Policy**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/01/foreign-trade-policy-ftp-2023-announced/)**.**

**The new foreign trade policy** emphasizes expediting the **SCOMET licensing process** to ensure that **sensitive and dual-use goods** are traded in **compliance with international regimes,** including the **Missile Technology Control Regime**.

**What is MECR (Missile and Dual-Use Export Control Regimes)?**

They are voluntary agreements among **major supplier countries aimed** at preventing the proliferation of certain military and **dual-use technologies**, particularly those related to Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).

These agreements are **independent of the United Nations** and apply only to their member countries, with **no obligation for others to joi**n.

**India is a member of three out of the four MECRs**, excluding the **Nuclear Suppliers Group**.

**The four MECRs include:**

- **Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG)** for nuclear technology control
- **Australia Group (AG**) for chemical and biological technology control
- **Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR)** for rockets and aerial vehicles related to WMD delivery,
