#### **GS4/ GS2 Paper** 

 **Syllabus: Corporate Ethics/ Corporate Governance**

**Source:** [**OECD**](https://www.oecd.org/corporate/principles-corporate-governance/)

**Context:** On September 11th (2023), the OECD launched the **revised** [**G20/OECD Principles of Corporate Governance**](https://www.oecd.org/corporate/principles-corporate-governance/), a set of international standards aimed at promoting corporate sustainability, market confidence, and financial stability.

**What is** [**Corporate Governance**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/03/15/mission-2022-mindmap-corporate-governance/corporate-governance-2/)**?**

Corporate governance essentially involves **balancing the interests of a company’s many stakeholders, such as shareholders**, senior management executives, customers, suppliers, financiers, the government, and the community.

**Ethical Issues with Corporate Governance in India:**

- **Conflict of Interest:**The challenge of managers potentially enriching themselves at the cost of shareholders
- **Weak Board:**Lack of diversity of experience and background represents a major area of weakness for these boards.
- **Separation of ownership and management:**In the case of family-run companies, the separation of ownership and management remains a key challenge
- **Independent directors**

**About G20/OECD Principles of Corporate Governance**

The G20/OECD Principles of Corporate Governance are the international standard for corporate governance. It was first issued in 1999 and the revised Principles were endorsed by **G20 Leaders in 2023**.

**Key points of G20/OECD Principles of Corporate Governance 2023**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Principle**|**Key Points**|
|**Objective**|The principles aim to **evaluate and enhance the legal, regulatory, and institutional framework** for corporate governance to support economic efficiency, sustainable growth, and financial stability.|
|**Scope of Corporate Governance**|Corporate governance encompasses relationships among a company’s management, board, shareholders, and stakeholders, providing the structure for achieving objectives and monitoring performance.|
|**Non-Binding Nature**|The principles are **non-binding and don’t replace national law**|
|**Applicability**|The principles primarily focus on publicly traded companies but can benefit smaller and unlisted companies, taking into account their diversity.|
|**Monitoring**|The principles are used as benchmarks globally and **monitored through various mechanisms, such as the OECD Corporate Governance Factbook.**|
|**Structure of the Principles**|**The principles are organized into six chapters.**|
|**Chapter I**|**Ensuring the basis for an effective corporate governance framework:**<br><br>·        Legal and regulatory requirements should be consistent with the **rule of law**.<br><br>·        Due attention to the associated **risks of Digital technologies**|
|**Chapter II**|**The rights and equitable treatment of shareholders and key ownership functions:** Address **conflicts of interest** inherent in related transactions.|
|**Chapter III**|**Institutional investors, stock markets, and other intermediaries:** Prohibition of insider trading and market manipulation|
|**Chapter IV**|**Disclosure and transparency:** Include **Capital structures**, group structures, voting rights, etc. **Annual external audit** by an independent agency|
|**Chapter V**|**The responsibilities of the board:** Treat all shareholders fairly, and ensure a **formal and transparent board nomination** and election process, etc.|
|**Chapter VI**|**Sustainability and resilience:** Corporate governance policies addressing sustainability contribute to a company’s long-term success; **Sustainability-related disclosure frameworks** should be consistent with internationally recognized standards.|

**Suggestions to improve Corporate Governance in India:**

**Recommendations of** [**Uday Kotak Panel**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Role-of-Independent-Directors.pdf)**:**

- **Diverse board members**: Minimum 6 directors to be on the board of listed entities; every listed entity to have at least 1 independent woman director
- **Transparency**: More transparency on the appointment of independent directors
- **The audit Committee** must review the use of loans.
- **Robust risk** management policies
- Effective governance infrastructure
- Evaluation of the **Board’s performance**
- **Communication**: Facilitating shareholder communication with the board is key.

**Good Examples by corporates in India: TATA Groups**

**Tata companies** continually aspire to better ethics, just as they are committed to better business practices. Philanthropic trusts control over **66% of Tata holdings**. While the Tata family has a very small shareholding.

#### **GS Paper 4**

 **Syllabus: Applications of Ethics**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/outrage-in-us-over-death-of-indian-student-us-assures-prompt-action-and-investigation/article67306300.ece)

**Example 1:**

**Context**: The reports on the death of **Indian student Jaahnavi Kandula in Seattle**, who was struck by a speeding **police patrol car** and then her death was laughed at by the officers as having **“limited Value”**

**The incident highlights several ethical issues:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Ethical Issues**|**Description**|
|**Insensitive Behaviour**|Officer Daniel Auderer’s **lack of empathy and dismissive attitude** toward a tragic incident reflects a **lack of compassion**.|
|**Accountability**|**Delay in addressing the incident** and ensuring accountability raises concerns about transparency, fairness, and justice.|
|**Community Trust**|The incident threatens to **erode trust** between the community and law enforcement, raising ethical concerns.|
|**Diversity and Respect**|Comments about the **value of an individual’s life** based on background and her age, raise ethical concerns about **bias and discrimination**.|

**Example 2:**

**Context**: Resignation of **Luis Rubiales**, the chief of **Spain’s football federation** in the wake of a scandal involving allegations of sexual assault for kissing a female player, **Jenni Hermoso**, during the Women’s World Cup medals ceremony.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Ethical Issue**|**Description**|
|**Sexual Assault**|Rubiales faced allegations of sexual assault for kissing a female player, Jenni Hermoso, **without her consent** during a public event.|
|**Abuse of Power**|Accusations were made that **Rubiales abused his position as the chief of Spain’s football federation** to engage in inappropriate conduct with a player.|
|**Lack of Consent**|The incident raised **ethical concerns regarding consent**, as Hermoso stated that she was kissed against her will|
|**Gender Equality**|Rubiales’ actions **sparked discussions about gender equality and respect for women in football,** highlighting issues of gender discrimination and **machismo**.|

Similar accusations have been made **against the former chief of the Wrestling federation in India**. These incidents highlight the issues of lack of ethics in sports.

The [Devadasi system](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/01/15/devadasi-system/#:~:text=Devadasi%20system%20is%20a%20religious,push%20young%20girls%20into%20prostitution.) was a **traditional practice in India** where young girls were **dedicated or married to deities or temples**. However, over time, it degenerated into a system where some Devadasis were **forced into a life of prostitution**.

**Muthulakshmi Reddy** was a prominent figure in the **Madras presidency** and had achieved several milestones in her career, including being the **first Indian woman medical graduate** in Madras in 1912 and holding various **legislative positions**.

**The Trigger for Her Campaign:** Her campaign against the Devadasi system began in 1927 after she received a poignant letter from a **13-year-old girl, Shanpakvalli.** Shanpakvalli came from a family of Devadasis and wanted to avoid her fate as Devadasi.

**Influential Women and Movements:** Muthulakshmi was influenced by her mother, who was also from the Devadasi community and had revolted against the system.

**Empowering Women**: Muthulakshmi advocated for education as a means to liberate women from the system and proposed **granting lands to those women entitled to economic benefits** from the temples.

Despite opposition, including **within the Congress party**, Muthulakshmi persisted. The Devadasi system was **eventually abolished in 1947 by the Madras Legislative Assembly**.

**Her Legacy**: Muthulakshmi Reddy’s campaign against the Devadasi system remains an enduring and **inspiring example of social reform**.

**Usage**: The example can be used as a story in an **Essay/ Ethics** (to show values of **Social Justice, Empowerment, Persistence, Leadership etc.** )/ Indian History/ Indian Society

#### **Facts for Prelims (FFP)**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/webb-telescope-ocean-planet-methane-carbon-8936302/)

**Context:** Scientists using the [**James Webb Space Telescope**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/04/15/james-webb-space-telescope-4/) have discovered **methane and carbon dioxide on the exoplanet K2-18 b**.

- **K2-18 b** is located in the **“Goldilocks zone”** around **the cool dwarf star K2-18**, where it receives just **enough starlight to maintain liquid water**.
- It’s considered a **“Hycean planet,”** a hypothetical **type of water-covered planet with a hydrogen-rich atmosphere** that some scientists believe is a good candidate for the search for signs of life.
- The presence of **methane and carbon dioxide**, along with a **shortage of ammonia, supports the hypothesis that K2-18 b may have a water ocean beneath its hydrogen-rich atmosphere**.
- The study also suggests the possible detection of a molecule called **dimethyl sulphide, which on Earth is primarily produced by life, particularly phytoplankton in the oceans.**

**Context: NASA** recently shared a **captivating image of Mercury**, the solar system’s **smallest planet,** on Instagram.

- The picture, taken by **MESSENGER**, the first spacecraft to **orbit Mercury**, showcases the **planet’s tan and blue hues, along with its cratered surface.**

**About Mercury:**

- **NASA provided intriguing details about Mercury**, emphasizing its diminutive size, **its proximity to the Sun** (about 36 million miles or 58 million km away), and its incredible speed, **travelling at nearly 29 miles (47 km) per second, resulting in a year on Mercury being just 88 Earth days.**
- The post also **highlighted Mercury’s unique characteristics**, such as its **thin exosphere consisting of elements like oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium**.
- Due to its **lack of atmosphere and proximity to the Sun**, the planet experiences extreme temperature fluctuations, **ranging from a scorching 800ºF (430ºC) during the day to a frigid -290 ºF (-180 ºC) at night**.
- Additionally, Mercury possesses a **relatively weak magnetic field, only 1% as strong as Earth’s**, which interacts with solar winds to create magnetic tornados across the planet’s surface.

 **Context:** A **new** [**cybercrime**](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/08/sansad-tv-cyber-crime/) **investigation tool** has been developed to **track cyberattacks that target humans, such as insurance fraud and online matrimonial fraud.**

- This tool, known as the **TTP (tactics, techniques, and procedures)-**based cybercrime investigation framework, **aids in tracking and categorizing cybercrimes**.
- It identifies the **chain of evidence required to solve a case and maps evidence onto the framework to convict criminals.**
- The technology **can create an approximate crime execution path**, suggest a crime path based on **user-derived keywords, compare the modus operandi used in different crimes, manage user roles, and track activity for crime paths**.
- By relying on **criminals’ tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), the TTPs-based investigation framework is expected to be highly effective in convicting cybercriminals quickly and precisely.**

The developed cybercrime investigation framework and tool are now ready for deployment with law enforcement agencies. This advancement is expected to make it easier to track and convict cybercriminals, ultimately reducing cybercrime activities in the country.
