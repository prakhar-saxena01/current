### [New UGC Norms: Foreign universities can set up a campus](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/06/new-ugc-norms-foreign-universities-can-set-up-a-campus/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus:** **Issues relating to the development and management of Social Sector/Services relating to Health, Education, Human Resources**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/education/foreign-universities-in-india-can-decide-their-admission-process-fee-ugc-chairperson-m-jagadesh-kumar-8362763/)

 **Direction:** The article highlights the key provisions, significance and concerns with respect to the draft regulations of the UGC for setting up and operating campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India.

**Context:** The University Grants Commission (UGC) released the draft UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations 2023.

**Background:** The **National Education Policy**, 2020, envisages a legislative framework to allow top global universities to operate in India.

**Highlights of the draft:**

- **It seeks to allow foreign universities** –
    - **To set up their campuses in India**.
    - Decide their admission process, fee structure (to be reasonable), etc.
    - To repatriate funds (to be governed by the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999) to their parent campuses.
- **The operation of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions** **shall not be contrary to the –**
    - Sovereignty and integrity of India
    - Security of the State
    - Friendly relations with foreign States
    - Public order, decency, morality
    - Standards of higher education in India
- **Top 500 global rankings** or “reputed” universities are eligible to apply and will be granted approval **to operate for 10 years**.
- The regulations provide foreign institutions **complete autonomy to hire faculty and other staff** members either from abroad or in India.
- **The UGC will have the right to inspect** the campuses at any time and such campuses will not be outside the purview of anti-ragging and other criminal laws.

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/draft.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/draft.png)**

**The application process:**

- A web-based portal maintained by the UGC will receive proposals → A committee formed by the UGC will evaluate the applications and make recommendations within 45 days → The selected applicants will be given **about 2 years to set up campuses.**
- They will have to **mandatorily impart education in offline mode**.

**Significance of the draft:**

- Allowing foreign universities **will ensure diverse courses**, such as in the fields of urban design and fashion design.
- **Reduce forex reserve depletion.** In 2022 over **5 lahks** (four point five) of Indian students went abroad to study, leading to an outflow of an estimated $28-30 billion.
- Around 40 million students in India, currently pursuing higher education, **will have access to global quality education**.

**Concerns:**

- **The national security clause is too restrictive in nature.** However, any aggrieved party will have the right to approach the judiciary.
- Campuses in Gujarat’s GIFT will remain outside the purview of the UGC regulations.

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus:** **Government Policies and Interventions for Development in various sectors and Issues arising out of their Design and Implementation**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/explained-how-is-india-moving-to-regulate-online-gaming/article66335467.ece)

 **Direction:** The article is a comprehensive coverage of the draft amendments to the IT (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, which is an attempt to regulate online gaming in India.

**Context:** The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has released draft amendments to the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, in relation to online gaming.

**Background:**

- **An inter-ministerial task force** established by the MeitY to propose the contours of national-level legislation to regulate online gaming had previously made several recommendations.
- The draft of the proposed amendments has been released based on these.

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/KYC.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/KYC.png)

**What changes are being proposed?**

- **Defines an ‘online game’:** A game that is offered on the internet and is accessible by a user through a computer resource if s/he makes a deposit with the expectation of earning winnings.
    - Companies offering such online games will be **handled similarly to social media companies** in terms of regulatory compliances and obligations.
- **A self-regulatory body:** Online games would be required to register with a self-regulatory body, and only games approved by the authority will be permitted to function lawfully in India. MeitY can recognise and derecognise all self-regulated bodies.
- **Mandatory KYC norms:** Online gaming companies would be compelled to follow the same rules as entities regulated by the RBI.
- **Banning bets on the outcome:** Online gaming companies will not be permitted to accept bets on game outcomes.
- **Chief Compliance Officer:** The platforms are expected to appoint a senior employee, who would coordinate with law enforcement agencies to ensure compliance with their orders.
- **Nodal Contact Person:** To facilitate the necessary coordination at any point of the day. **Grievance redressal:** The platforms must have in place an appropriate mechanism for the receipt and resolution of grievances.

**Significance of the proposed changes:**

- **Safeguard the interests of users** (especially women and children).
- Addresses the discourse in the sector about the definitions of a **‘game of skill’ (**used in the Public Gambling Act (1867) but had not been defined**) and a ‘game of chance’**. The term ‘game of skill’ had been.
- **Endeavours to provide for greater transparency**. For example,
    - Operators would have to inform the user about the policy related to the withdrawal or refund of their deposit.
    - Addiction is to be combated using repeated warning messages while playing a certain game.
- These rules **will help curb the menace of anti-national** and illegal offshore gambling platforms.

**What are some of the concerns?**

- The rules **group all gaming intermediaries together**, regardless of size or risk.
- They all require **similar compliances**, including the requirement for executives to be based in India.
- This might place an **undue burden on young start-ups** and make it difficult for global players to launch services in India.

**Global practices:**

- **China** has placed strict limits on the time young people may spend playing online games and an online game must obtain approval before its launch.
- **In the U.S.**, Internet casino gaming remains illegal in every state that doesn’t explicitly legalise the games.
- **Germany**’s “Youth Protection” laws aimed at regulating violent games require developers to replace realistic red blood with a green version.
- **Australia** has sought to ban games for including depictions of everything from assault to marijuana use.

**Conclusion:** On the one hand, the proposed rules seek to expand the online gaming market and stimulate innovation, while on the other, they seek to regulate the online gaming market in India in order to protect users’ interests.

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus:** **Government Policies and Interventions for Development in various sectors**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/facebook-meta-data-privacy-advertising-fine-explained-8362699/#:~:text=Impact%20of%20the%20ruling,EU%20have%20to%20do%20currently.) 

**Direction:** The article highlights the implications of a fine imposed on Meta by an Irish agency for breaching the EU’s GDPR.

**Context:**

- Meta has been slapped with fines totalling €390 million by the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) for breaching **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**.
- Meta’s **profit forecasts for 2023 have dropped nearly 50%,** indicating that both users and advertisers are abandoning the platforms (exception – of Instagram Reels and WhatsApp).

**Background:**

- The company’s advertising and data handling practices have been accused of breaching the EU’s overarching privacy law – **GDPR**.
- The legal permission that Meta sought from users to collect their data for personalised advertising, **essentially forced them to accept personalised ads**, in violation of the GDPR.
- As per the GDPR, cross-border cases are handled by the data protection authority in the country where the company is based.

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GDPR-1.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GDPR-1.png)** **[](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GDPR.png)**

**Significance of the ruling:**

- **Strengthens the GDPR’s overarching theme** – the individual’s right over her data and the need for a person to give explicit consent before their data can be processed.
- The decision could imply that **Meta would have to tweak its apps** to ensure that they do not leverage personal data for advertising.

**Impact of the ruling:**

- **The likely ripple effect:** With a focus on privacy and requiring individuals to give explicit consent, the GDPR has substantially influenced legislation in nearly 160 countries.
- **Broadening individual’s right over her data:** A pair of sub-legislation of GDPR –
    - The Digital Services Act (DSA) focuses on issues such as regulating hate speech, etc.
    - The Digital Markets Act (DMA) defines a new category of “**dominant gatekeeper**” platforms and is focused on non-competitive practices and the abuse of dominance/**monopoly** by these players.

**The possible impact of the ruling on India:**

- The Government of India is currently working on a policy framework for the tech sector, which includes –
    - The **new Personal Data Protection bill**
    - A comprehensive Digital India Act that would eventually replace the existing IT Act, and
    - The new Telecom Bill
- Hence, the ruling could have resonance in India too.

 **Syllabus**: Food processing and related industries in India

**Source:** [**The Print**](https://theprint.in/science/biodiversity-of-bee-population-critical-for-ecosystems-research/1294511/)**,** [**PIB**](https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1889006)**,** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/wildlife-biodiversity/world-s-first-vaccine-for-honeybees-gets-conditional-nod-in-us-86970)

**Context**: A report highlighted, that the biodiversity of the **bee population is essential to preserving the ecosystem function of crop pollination, which is crucial to the availability of food for humans.**

**About Bee Cultivation/Apiculture:**

- **Apiculture** is the science and culture of **honeybees and their management**.
- As per the FAO, India **ranked eighth** in 2017-18 in the world in terms of honey production.
- National Beekeeping and Honey mission was launched to achieve the goal of **Sweet Revolution.**

**Opportunities in the Beekeeping sector**

- **Low investment and highly skilled enterprise model**.
- **The demand for good-quality honey has grown**
- **Role in pollination**
- **Scaling up beekeeping will double farmers’ income.**

**Challenges faced by the Beekeeping sector**

- **Indigenous method** of beekeeping: This is the **primitive and unplanned method** of apiculture.
- **Using the Correct Species for Beekeeping**
- **Lack of Technical Knowledge for Efficient Management of Colonies for High Honey Yields**
- **Lack of Infrastructure at the Grass Roots and National Level for Beekeeping**
- **Poor Quality Control for the Production of Honey:** contaminated not only by the use of **sugar syrup in processing** but also **through pesticide and antibiotics use.**
- **Availability of Genetically Superior Queens** for Increased Honey Production
- **Lack of sufficient financial help** from government and lending institutions for the development of beekeeping.
- **No Control on the Use of Pesticides** by Farmers Leading to Death of Bee Colonies in Field Locations.

**Recommendations made by Beekeeping Development Committee under Bibek Debroy:**

- Plantation of **bee-friendly flora at appropriate places** and engaging women SHG in managing such plantations.
- Institutionalizing the **National Bee Board and rechristening it as the Honey and Pollinators Board of India** under the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare.
- Recognition of apiculture as a **subject for advanced research under the aegis of ICAR.**
- **Training and development of beekeepers** by state governments.
- Development of **national and regional infrastructure**
- Simplifying procedures and specifying clear standards for ease **of exporting honey Hi-tech apiaries for commercial bee-farming**
- Research in the **fields of beekeeping, bee-behaviour**

**Related News:**

**World’s first vaccine for honeybees gets the conditional nod in the US**

**Context**: The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has granted a **conditional license for a vaccine for honeybees to curb American foulbrood (AFB**), a fatal **bacterial disease** for the insect.

**About American foulbrood**:

- AFB is caused by the **spore-forming bacterium Paenibacillus larvae.**
- Infected broods usually **die at the pre-pupal or pupal stage**.
- The disease cannot be cured, meaning that the **destruction of infected colonies and hives or irradiation of infected material is the only way to manage AFB.**

**How the vaccine will work:**

The vaccine technology exposes **queen bees to inactive (i.e., “dead”) bacteria**, which enables the larvae hatched in the hive to resist infection

- The vaccine is mixed in **queen candy —** the primary food source for both the queen bees and the attendant bees living in cages.
- **Worker bees** consume the **vaccine with the queen candy**, which is then **digested and transferred to the glands that produce the royal jelly.** Worker bees then feed the royal jelly containing the vaccine to the queen bee.
- **The queen digests the royal jelly and** the **vaccine is transferred to her ovaries**. She is then released into the hive. The vaccine gets transferred to the developing eggs. The developing larvae get vaccinated and are more immune to infection as they hatch.

**About National Beekeeping & Honey Mission (NBHM)**

- NBHM is a Central Sector Scheme, approved under **the Aatma Nirbhar Bharat** announcement, and implemented through **National Bee Board (NBB).**
- NBHM aims for the overall **promotion & development of scientific beekeeping** in the country to achieve the **goal of ‘Sweet Revolution**’ which is being implemented through NBB.

### **India now has 212 indigenous livestock breeds**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/agriculture/india-now-has-212-indigenous-livestock-breeds-after-icar-nbagr-registers-10-new-ones-86957)**,** [**ICAR**](https://icar.org.in/content/ten-new-breeds-indigenous-farm-animals-registered-icar-nbagr#:~:text=These%20breeds%20are%20%2DKathani%20cattle,Wak%20Chambil%20pig%20(Meghalaya).)

**Context**: The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) **has registered 10 new breeds of livestock species**, including **cattle, buffalo, goat and pig**. This has taken the total number of indigenous breeds to 212.

The 10 new breeds included three new **cattle breeds (Kathani, Sanchori, Masilum**), **one buffalo breed (Purnathadi), three goat breeds (Sojat, Karauli, Gujari)** and **three pig breeds (Banda, Manipuri Black, Wak Chambil)**

**Distribution:**

### **New electrolytes found can help better ammonia synthesis**

**Source:** [**PIB**](https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1888858)

 **Context:** A team of Indian scientists has developed a **new aqueous electrolyte** that can help make **electrochemical ammonia synthesis more efficient.**

It will useful for industries **producing green energy or hydrogen.**

**The inefficiency of the present process:**

- The electrochemical ammonia synthesis is largely limited by the **poor solubility of nitrogen (N2)** in the aqueous electrolyte environment as well as the **competitive hydrogen evolution reaction**. The obstacle faced was that **reduction of N2 has actually occurred in the aqueous medium.**

**How new electrolyte works:**

- Scientists from the **Institute of Nano Science and Technology (INST) Mohali,** an autonomous institute of the Department of Science and Technology (DST), have introduced a **new electrolyte called (NaBF4**),
- This electrolyte not only acts as an **N2-carrier in the medium but also works as a full-fledged “co-catalyst”** along with active material transition **metal-doped nanocarbon (MnN4**) to deliver a high yield of ammonia (NH3) at absolutely ambient experimental conditions.

### **98.7 per cent** **decline in Kala-azar cases since 2007 in India: Health Ministry**

**Source:** [**Economic Times**](https://health.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/industry/98-7-per-cent-decline-in-kala-azar-cases-since-2007-in-india-health-ministry/96754715#:~:text=New%20Delhi%3A%20There%20has%20been,country%20by%202023%2C%20it%20said.)

 **Context:** There has been a **98.7 per cent** decline in cases of Kala-azar from 44,533 in 2007 to 834 in 2022 in India

- India is committed to **eliminating Kalaa-Azar** from the country by **2023**
- **Elimination**is defined as **reducing the annual incidence of Kala Azar (KA) to less than 1 case** per 10,000 people at the sub-district level.

**About Kala-azar**

- **Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), also known as kala-azar,** is the most severe form of leishmaniasis and, without proper diagnosis and treatment, is associated with high fatality.
- It is also a **neglected tropical disease (NTD)**
- **Spread**: Caused by **protozoan parasites** of the Leishmania genus (transmitted through the bite of Sand flies), migrates to the internal organs such as the liver, spleen (hence “**visceral**”), and bone marrow.
- **Signs and symptoms**include fever, weight loss, fatigue, anaemia, and substantial swelling of the liver and spleen.
- Kala-azar is considered the **second deadliest parasitic killer** in the world after **Malaria**
- Kala-azar is **endemic to the Indian subcontinent**in 119 districts in four countries (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal)
- It is endemic to **four states** Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and West Bengal
- It is a **treatable disease with anti-leishmanial** medicines
- **Government steps**: National Kala Azar Elimination Programme; National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP)

### **Asian Elephants**

**Source**: [The Hindu](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/endangered-asian-elephant-has-lost-most-of-its-optimal-habitat-in-nilgiri-reserve-study/article66343549.ece#:~:text=Elephants%20winding%20their%20way%20up,terrain%20that%20is%20easily%20negotiable.)

**Context**: A recent study has found that the **endangered Asian elephants** which earlier used to roam freely across South-East Asia, all the way to China, but **“anthropogenic pressures”** have restricted them to mountain chains

**How do Anthropogenic activities fragment Elephant Habitat?**

- **Enclosing reserves** without looking at **how the terrain is distributed leads to fragmentation**. If elephants cannot move from one valley to the next on relatively flat terrain, then population connectivity gets severed
- **The Palghat Gap** (in the Kerela Western Ghats) is a break in the Ghats that is “relatively flat and consequently easily negotiable by elephants”. However, human settlements and crop cultivation have hindered the movement of the elephants, keeping them confined to the hilly areas, considered sub-optimal habitats.

**Impact of fragmentation:**

- **Loss of Habitat**g., Indian Elephant has lost most of its optimal habitat in Nilgiris Reserve
- **On genetic diversity:** If movement is restricted and gene flow reduced, there is more in-breeding, and low genetic diversity, pushing up chances of disease and lowering fertility rates.

**About Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve (NBR)**

- **Name Origin**: From the **blue flower-clad mountains** of the Nilgiris plateau (TN)
- It was the **first biosphere reserve** in India established in the year 1986.
- It is located in the **Western Ghats**and encompasses parts of Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka.
- **The confluence of Biotic zones:**It is at the confluence of **Afro-tropical and Indo-Malayan biotic zones** of the world.
- It is a **Biodiversity Hotspot**
- **Fauna and Flora**: Nilgiri tahr, Nilgiri langur, and Freshwater fishes such as Nilgiri danio, Nilgiri barb and Bowany barb are endemic to this Biosphere Reserve.
- **The river that originates from Nilgiri**: Bhavani, Moyar, Kabini (tributaries of the river Cauvery) and other rivers like Chaliyar, Punampuzha, etc., have their source and catchment areas within the reserve boundary.
- **Tribal**: Todas, Kotas, Irullas, Kurumbas, Paniyas, Adiyans, Edanadan Chettis, Cholanaickens, Allar, Malayan, etc., are native to the reserve.
- **Protected Areas in NBR:** Mudumalai Wildlife Sanctuary, Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary, Bandipur National Park, Nagarhole National Park, Mukurthi National Park and Silent Valley are the protected areas present within this reserve.

### **How do some animals become transparent?**

**Source:** [**The Hindu**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/science-for-all-how-do-some-animals-become-transparent/article66337152.ece)

**Context**:  Recently scientists gleaned insight into **how glass frogs –a species known for this ability** – are able to achieve such transparency.

**About Glass frogs:**

Glass frogs live in the **American tropics and are nocturnal amphibians** that spend their days sleeping **upside down on translucent leaves** that match the colour of their backs — a common camouflage tactic. Their **translucent skin and muscle allow their bones and organs to be visible**.

**How Glassfrog become transparent:**

- Resting glass frogs increase transparency two- **to threefold by removing nearly 90 per cent of their red blood cells from circulation and packing them within their liver**, which contains **reflective guanine crystals.**
- Whenever the frogs need to become active again, **they bring the red blood cells back into the blood, which gives the frogs the ability to move around** — at which point, light absorption from these cells breaks transparency.
- In most vertebrates, aggregating red blood cells can lead to potentially dangerous blood clots in veins and arteries. However, **glass frogs don’t experience clotting.**
