### [Ozone hole is filling up](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/11/ozone-hole-is-filling-up/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus:** **Environment and Conservation**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/ozone-hole-filling-up-now-antarctica-montreal-protocol-greenhouse-gases-climate-change-8374040/)

 **Direction:** The article discusses the efforts made to repair the ozone hole and how these efforts paid off.

**Context:**

- The ozone hole, previously thought to be the most serious threat to planetary life, is now predicted to be completely healed by 2066.
- This is stated in an UN-backed scientific team report titled ‘Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion 2022’.

**Key highlights of the report:**

- **The ozone layer is predicted to return to 1980 levels** over Antarctica by 2066, 2045 for the Arctic, and 2040 for the remainder of the planet.
- The ozone hole has been steadily improving since 2000, thanks to the **Montreal Protocol’s** (1987) effective implementation.
    - The Montreal Protocol mandates countries to phase out production of all main **ozone depleting substances** (ODSs).
    - **The Kigali Amendment** (2016) to the Montreal Protocol aims to phase down 80-90% of the hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) currently in use by 2050.
    - **HFCs have replaced chlorofluorocarbons** (CFCs) in industrial use and the amendment seeks to prevent additional 0.3 to 0.5 degree Celsius of global warming by the end of the century.
    - HFCs do not cause much ozone layer damage, which is why they were not originally prohibited, but they are **extremely powerful greenhouse gases** (GHGs).
- Nearly 99% of the Montreal Protocol-banned substances have now been phased out of usage, resulting in a **slow but steady rebuilding of the ozone layer.**
- The eradication of ODSs has a **significant climate change co-benefit** because these compounds are also potent GHGs, expected to prevent 0.5 to 1 degree Celsius of warming by 2050.

**Is it possible to use the success of repairing the ozone hole to slow the rate of global warming?**

- The success of the Montreal Protocol in closing the ozone hole is widely mentioned as a **model for climate action.**
- However, the parallels between the eradication of ODSs and the reduction of GHGs are limited because **the usage of ODSs (though widespread) was limited to a few specific industries and their replacements were readily available.**

**The case of fossil fuels is very different**:

- CO2 emissions are directly related to energy production and it is **produced by almost every economic activity.**
- **Even so-called renewable energies**, such as solar and wind, have significant carbon footprints due to the use of fossil fuels in their manufacturing, transportation, and operation.
- **Methane** emissions, the other primary GHG, are primarily caused by agricultural operations and livestock.

**Conclusion:**

- The influence of reducing GHG emissions is **not restricted to a few economic sectors**, but affects the entire economy, as well as human lifestyles, habits, and behaviours.
- Without a question, dealing with climate change is a considerably more challenging and complex problem than dealing with ozone depletion.

### **What is Recession?**

 **Source:** [**ET**](https://bfsi.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/industry/world-bank-recession-a-looming-threat-for-global-economy/96891441#:~:text=The%20global%20economy%20will%20come,World%20Bank%20warned%20on%20Tuesday.)

 **Context:** According to the World Bank’s annual report, the global economy will come “dangerously close” to a recession this year, **owing to poorer growth in all of the world’s top economies** – the United States, Europe, and China.

**Warning signs:**

- The WB has reduced its forecast for global growth this year by nearly half, **to 1.7%, from 3% previously.**
- If that projection is correct, it will be the **third-weakest yearly expansion** in three decades, trailing only the massive recessions caused by the 2008 global financial crisis and the 2020 coronavirus pandemic.

**The impact of a global downturn:**

- It would fall particularly hard on poorer countries in such areas as Saharan Africa, which is home to 60% of the world’s poor.
- Weakness in growth and business investment will **exacerbate the already terrible reversals in education, health, poverty, and infrastructure**, as well as the rising demands of climate change.

### **Title 42**

 **S****ource:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/what-is-the-us-title-42-immigration-policy-explained-8369060/)

 **Context:** The US announced to extend COVID-19 pandemic-era restrictions, known as Title 42, to expel migrants from Nicaragua, Cuba and Haiti caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border back to Mexico.

**Background:** At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, U.S. health authorities issued Title 42 to allow border agents to rapidly send migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border back to Mexico or other countries.

### **What is a cold wave?**

 **Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/what-is-cold-wave-northwest-india-shivering-8373312/)

 **Context:** Delhi and other parts of northwest India have been currently reeling under a cold wave spell.

**Background:** In Delhi (the Safdarjung weather station), the lowest minimum temperature recorded this month was **1.9 degrees Celsius** on January 8.

**What is a cold wave?**

- In the plains, the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) **marks a cold wave in terms of minimum temperatures** –
    - When the minimum temperature is 4 degrees or less or
    - When the minimum temperature is less than 10 degrees and 4.5 to 6.4 degrees below the normal.

**Reasons for the temperature drop in north and north-west India:**

- **Large-scale fog cover**, preventing sunlight from reaching the surface and affecting the radiation balance**.**
- **Light winds and high moisture near the land surface** have been contributing to the fog.
- Foggy or cloudy nights are usually associated with warmer nights, **but if the fog remains for two or three days, cooling begins even at night.**
- While **westerly and north-westerly winds** of around 5 to 10 kmph in the afternoon have also been contributing to the dip in temperature.
- Absence of **western disturbances** over the region. Western disturbances are storms from the Mediterranean region, which are associated with a change in wind direction, bringing easterly winds to northwest India.

### **Section 6A of the Citizenship Act, 1955**

 **Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/section-6a-case-up-for-preliminary-determination-by-sc-constitution-bench/article66362225.ece#:~:text=Section%206A%20was%20a%20special,heritage%2C%20linguistic%20and%20social%20identity)

**Context:** A Constitution Bench led by Chief Justice of India said it will first take up for preliminary assessment if Section 6A of the Citizenship Act, 1955 suffers from any “constitutional infirmity”.

**Background:**

- Petitions were filed to challenge Section 6A’s “**discriminatory**” nature in granting citizenship to illegal immigrants.
- The petitioners said that the special clause violated **Article 6 of the Indian Constitution**, which established July 19, 1948 as the threshold for awarding citizenship to immigrants.

**Section 6A:**

- It was a specific provision incorporated into the 1955 Act in pursuance of the ‘**Assam Accord**,’ which was signed on August 15, 1985 by the then-central government with the leaders of the Assam Movement.
- The Accord came at the culmination of a six-year campaign by the All-Assam Students Union (AASU) to **identify and deport illegal immigrants** (entered after March 25, 1971) **from the state**, largely from neighbouring Bangladesh.
- Under Section 6A, foreigners who had entered Assam **before January 1, 1966**, and been “ordinarily resident” in the State, would have all the rights and obligations of Indian citizens.
- Those who had entered the State **between January 1, 1966 and March 25, 1971** would have the same rights and obligations except that they would not be able to vote for 10 years.

### **Very Short-Range Air Defence System or VSHORAD**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/vshorad-missile-systearmy-mountain-warfare-prowess-8375754/)

**Context:** The Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) accorded Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) to procure the Very Short-Range Air Defence System or VSHORAD (Infrared Homing) missile system, **designed and developed by the DRDO**.

**Background:**

- The development comes amid the ongoing military standoff with China at the LAC in eastern Ladakh.
- India has been in talks with Russia since 2018 to procure the **Igla-S air defence missiles** at a cost of $1.5 billion under the VSHORAD programme in a bid to replace the Russian **Igla-M** systems which have been in use with the Army.
- However, there has been little progress on that front with the government pitching for **Atma Nirbharta (self-dependence) in defence**.

**What is the missile system?** Meant to kill **low altitude aerial threats at short ranges**, VSHORADS is a man portable Air Defence System (MANPAD) designed and developed indigenously by DRDO in a way to ensure easy portability.

**How will it help India?**

- Being man portable and lightweight, it can be deployed in the **mountains close to the LAC** at a short notice.
- Others like the Akash Short Range Surface to Air Missile System are **heavier with a theatre air defence umbrella** of up to 25 km.
