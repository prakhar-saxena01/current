### [Why the Indian rupee fell 10% against the US dollar in 2022?](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/02/why-the-indian-rupee-fell-10-against-the-us-dollar-in-2022/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus:** **Indian Economy and related issues**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/why-rupee-fell-against-the-us-dollar-in-2022-explained-8355720/#:~:text=The%20Indian%20rupee%20depreciated%20by,surrounding%20the%20Russia%2DUkraine%20conflict.)

**Direction:** The article highlights the reasons behind the depreciation of the Indian Rupee and presents an outlook for 2023.

**Context:** The Indian rupee depreciated by around 10% against the US dollar in 2022.

**Depreciation** reduces the value of a country’s currency when compared with the currency of other countries (say ₹), measured by the exchange rate of the local currency (wrt ₹)

**The performance of the Indian rupee in 2022:**

**Worst-performing Asian currency in 2022:**

- It witnessed a fall of around **10%** against the US dollar, falling **to a lifetime low of 83.2** the dollar.
- Compared to the rupee, the Chinese Yuan, Philippine Peso and Indonesian Rupiah fell by around **9%** and the South Korean Won and Malaysian Ringgit declined by nearly **7 and 6%**, respectively.

**Reason for this decline in India:**

- **The US Fed aggressively raised interest rates** (by 425 basis points (bps) in 2022) in its fight against inflation, **leading to a higher interest rate differential between the US and India**
- As a result, **investors pulled out money** from the domestic market and started investing in the US market **to take advantage of higher rates.**
- **For example,** foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) pulled out **Rs 1.34 lakh** crore from the Indian markets in 2022, **putting pressure on the rupee**.
- **The Russian invasion of Ukraine** accentuated the FPI withdrawals with the global economic slowdown making inflows tougher.

**Steps taken to arrest this decline:**

- The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) **heavily intervened** in the foreign exchange (forex) market to defend the rupee.
- As a result, **the country’s forex reserves have fallen by $70 billion (**$562.81 billion as of December 23, 2022) since the beginning of 2022.
- However, the central bank is **now starting to again build up its reserves** and that would act as a buffer in times of uncertainty.

**The outlook on the rupee for 2023:** India remains the **fastest-growing economy and** Indian Rupee will recover

**Q. How would the recent phenomena of protectionism and currency manipulations in world trade affect the macroeconomic stability of India? (UPSC 2018)**

**Prelims Links:** **(UPSC 2022)**

With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following statements:

1. An increase in Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) indicates the appreciation of the rupee.
2. An increase in the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) indicates an improvement in trade competitiveness.
3. An increasing trend in domestic inflation relative to inflation in other countries is likely to cause an increasing divergence between NEER and REER.

Which of the above statements is/are correct?

1. 1. 1. 1 and 2 only
        2. 2 and 3 only
        3. 1 and 3 only
        4. 1, 2 and 3

**Ans: 3**

**Explanation:** An increase in the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) indicates a **loss** in trade competitiveness. An increase in the REER implies that exports become more expensive and imports become cheaper.

### [Why has loan recovery via Lok Adalat jumped four-fold?](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/02/why-has-loan-recovery-via-lok-adalat-jumped-four-fold/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus:** **Indian Economy and issues relating to Planning, Mobilization of Resources**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/express-plus/today-newsstand/)

**Direction:** The article highlights why the number of stressed accounts reported to Lok Adalats by banks increased dramatically in 2021-22 and contains explanatory infographics on Lok Adalats and NPAs.

**Context:**

- In 2021-22, the number of non-performing assets (NPAs) referred by banks to various recovery channels, including Lok Adalat and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), increased fourfold over 2020-21.
- Among all channels, the number of stressed accounts reported to **Lok Adalats** by banks **increased dramatically** in 2021-22.

**[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/lokadalat.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/lokadalat.png)**

**Background:**

 **Bank’s Loan recovery mechanisms:** 

- **Lok Adalat:** Conducted by NALSA, the awards of Lok Adalat are final and binding on all parties
- **IBC:** Introduced in 2016 and amended in 2021, IBC provides a time-bound process of resolving the insolvency of corporate debtors (330 days)
- **Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs):** Along with Debts Recovery Appellate Tribunals (est. Under Recovery of debts and Bankruptcy Act, 1993) for expeditious adjudication and recovery of debts.
- **Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of the Security Interest Act (SARFAESI Act 2002):** Under this, banks can take control of securities pledged against the loan and manage or sell them to recover dues without any court intervention. 

**Why cases referred to Lok Adalats increased dramatically?**

- Banks send stressed accounts worth **up to Rs.20 lakh to Lok Adalats**, which are organised by **banks in collaboration with the district legal service authority.**
- The number of cases referred to Lok Adalats is high since the **cost of recovery through this route is lower** than through DRTs or SARFAESI.
- However, the rate of recovery through this route has been very low (2.3% in 2021-22 and 4% in 2020-21), **as it is very difficult to recover loans from defaulters in the small-ticket loan segment.**

### [The danger of deep fakes](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/02/the-danger-of-deep-fakes/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus:** **Role of Media and Social Networking Sites in Internal Security Challenges**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/the-danger-of-deepfakes/article66327991.ece)

**Direction:** The article explains deepfakes, threats as a result of malicious deepfakes, steps taken by countries across the world and some solutions to curb them.

**Context:** The disinformation threat has a new tool in the form of deep fakes.

**What are deepfakes?**

- **Deepfakes are digital media** – video, audio, and images **edited and manipulated using Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to inflict harm on individuals and institutions.
- **AI-Generated Synthetic media or deepfakes** have clear **benefits** in certain areas, such as accessibility, education, film production, criminal forensics, and artistic expression.
- However, it can be **exploited** (hyper-realistic digital falsification) **to damage the reputation**, fabricate evidence, defraud the public, and undermine trust in democratic institutions with **fewer resources** (cloud computing, AI algorithms and abundant data).

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/face_1.jpg?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/face_1.jpg)**

**[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/face_2.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/face_2.png)**

**Threats:**

- **96%** of deepfakes are pornographic videos, **reducing women to sexual objects** and causing emotional distress.
- Deepfake can **depict a person as indulging in antisocial behaviours** and can create **social discord, increase polarization**, and can even influence the **election outcome**
- Deepfakes can accelerate the **trust deficit in traditional media** and could be used by **nation-state actors** to create chaos in the target country, undermining trust in institutions and
- Misuse by **non-state actors (**terrorist organisations), **to stir anti-state sentiments among people**.
- The threat of the **liar’s dividend** – an undesirable truth is dismissed as deepfake or fake news, giving more credibility to denials.
- **Weaponisation of deepfakes,** use of fake news and alternative-facts narrative to **dismiss an actual piece of media and truth.**

**What countries are doing to combat deep fakes?**

- **China:** A new policy that requires service providers and users to ensure that any doctored content using the technology is explicitly labelled and can be traced back to its source.
- **The European Union**: an updated **Code of Practice**, that requires tech companies including Google, Meta, and Twitter to take measures in countering deepfakes on their platforms.
    - If found non-compliant, these companies can face fines of as much as **6% of their annual global turnover.**
- **The U.S: T**he bipartisan **Deepfake Task Force Act** to assist the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to counter deepfake technology by conducting an annual study of deep fakes.
- **In India**, there are **no legal rules** against using deep fake technology. However, specific laws can be addressed for misusing the tech, which includes Copyright Violation, Defamation and cybercrimes.

**Case of Canada:**

- While Canada does not have any regulations to tackle deep fakes, **it is undertaking some of the most cutting-edge AI research** with a number of domestic and foreign actors.
- Also, **Canada is a member and leader** in many related multilateral initiatives (**Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace, Global Partnership on AI**), which can be utilised to create deepfake policy in different areas.

**Solutions:**

- **Media literacy** for consumers is the most effective tool to combat disinformation and deep fakes.
- **Meaningful regulations** with a collaborative discussion with the technology industry, civil society and policymakers to disincentivise the creation and distribution of malicious deepfakes.
- **Easy-to-use and accessible technology solutions** to detect deepfakes, authenticate media, and amplify authoritative sources.
- **Social media platforms are taking cognizance** of the deepfake issue, and almost all of them have some policy or acceptable terms of use for deepfakes.

**Conclusion:** We must all take responsibility for being critical Internet media consumers, thinking and pausing before sharing on social media, and being part of the solution to this **‘infodemic**.’

### **Mission Parivartan**

**Direction:** The example can be used to show changes in society but also deep-seated mentality remains an obstacle to women’s empowerment.

It is a joint venture of the **Delhi government and automaker Ashok Leyland** to induct women drivers into **Delhi Transport Cooperation and cluster buses** for promoting **women’s safety in public transport**. Under this programme, the women drivers underwent a comprehensive training programme where they were also taught **how to repair a bus** in case it breaks down.

**However, they face various issues in doing their jobs:**

- Bus driving and transport sector is seen as a **male-dominated field** and women are often not accepted
- **Lack of respect for women** drivers
- **Heated arguments** by male passengers often while being drunk
- **Taunts by men peers**: E.g. “If you don’t know how to drive, why did you even become a driver?”

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/women_driver.jpg?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/women_driver.jpg)**

### **Aymanam**

**Direction**: The example can be used for inclusive, sustainable and gendered tourism

**Aymanam is a model Responsible Tourism** (RT) village in Kottayam (Kerela), where  about 80% of the work – including accommodation, food and community tours, is being managed by women

- It is a part of the **Kerala government’s initiative** to create a women-friendly tourism network in the State.

**Significance:**

- It will **redress the gender balance** in the tourism sector by showcasing women’s talent.
- Turn the village into a hub of women-friendly destinations
- It will give women an equal voice in the tourism
- Help empower women at the grassroots level by highlighting what they do and sell.

**Responsible Tourism** is about “making better places for people to live in and better places for people to visit.” Responsible Tourism requires that operators, hoteliers, governments, local people and tourists take responsibility, and take action to make tourism more sustainable.

### **Ethylene Glycol (Quality Control) Order, 2022**

**Source**: [DTE](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/health/uzbekistan-fallout-union-government-issues-ethylene-glycol-quality-control-order-2022--86857#:~:text=Published%3A%20Thursday%2029%20December%202022&text=The%20Department%20of%20Chemicals%20and,Order%2C%202022%20on%20December%2029.)

**Context**: The **Department of Chemicals and Petrochemicals** under the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers issued a gazette notification titled **Ethylene Glycol (Quality Control) Order, 2022**

- Recently, Uzbekistan alleged **18 child deaths** in Samarkand from the consumption of medicinal syrup manufactured by an Indian drugmaker (Marion Biotech’s cough syrup Dok 1 Max). The syrup is manufactured containing **ethylene glycol**
- Previously, In October, **four sub-standard India-made** products typically used to treat cough symptoms had caused the deaths of **66 children** in Gambia (Africa)

**Under ‘Conformity to standards and compulsory use of the standard mark’, the order stated:**

- **Certification and enforcement authority:** In respect of specific goods or articles, **the Bureau of Indian Standards** shall be the certifying and enforcing authority.
- **Penalty for contravention**: Any person who contravenes the provisions of this Order shall be punishable under the provisions of the said Act.

**About Ethylene glycol:**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/glycol-1024x1024.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/glycol.png)

Ethylene glycol is a useful industrial compound found in many consumer products. Examples include **antifreeze, hydraulic brake fluids, some stamp pad inks, ballpoint pens, solvents, paints, plastics, films, and cosmetics**. It can also be a pharmaceutical vehicle.

**Why is ethylene glycol toxic to humans?**

Ethylene glycol’s toxicity mainly results from the accumulation of its toxic **metabolites**. Ethylene glycol is a **central nervous system (CNS) depressant** that produces acute effects similar to those of ethanol. (more in the Infographic above)

**How can Cough syrups kill children?**

If glycerine, a key ingredient in cough syrup, is replaced with toxic industrial solvents **diethylene glycol (DEG)** or **Ethylene Glycol (EG)**, the cough syrups become toxic.

**How can they end up in cough syrup?**

DEG and EG are **cheap**, so they are sometimes used illegally, as a **substitute solvents**. If consumed in high doses, they can cause kidney failure

### **Satyendra Nath Bose**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/birth-anniversary-satyendra-nath-bose-indian-scientist-achievements-8355163/)

- Satyendra Nath Bose (1 January 1894 – 4 February 1974) was a Bengali mathematician and physicist **specialising in theoretical physics.**
- He is best known for his work on **quantum mechanics** in the early 1920s, in developing the foundation for **Bose-Einstein statistics** and the theory of the **Bose condensate.**
- A Fellow of the Royal Society, he was awarded India’s second-highest civilian award, the **Padma Vibhushan** (in 1954) by the Government of India.
- The class of particles that obey Bose statistics, **bosons**, was named after Bose by Paul Dirac.

### **Gelbots**

**Source:** [**The Hindu**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/what-are-gelbots/article66288742.ece)

**Context**: Made out of **gelatin**, a **gelbot** is a significant advance in the **world of ‘soft robotics**,’ or robots that are fashioned out of organic and non-metallic materials.

**About the Gelbots:**

- A **3D-printed device**
- Move **without requiring an extra power source**.
- Feels like a Fruit gum rather than hard metallic surfaces of robots.
- **Extremely promising materials for soft robotics**.
- They rely on the principle that **gels that swell or shrink in response to temperature can be used to create smart structures.** 
- **Cheap and easy to mass produce**

**Uses**:

- To deliver **targeted medicines**.
- Deployed as **marine robots, patrolling and monitoring the ocean’s surface**.
- **Minimally invasive** technology for biomedical diagnosis and treatment.

**Context**: WALLABY, or the **Widefield ASKAP L-band Legacy All-sky Blind survey,** is a radio telescope in Western Australia that is helping astronomers build a **three-dimensional map of the night sky, mapping galaxies as far as a billion light years away.**

Radio astronomy involves tracking the **signals from radio waves and helps detect and trace stellar objects that cannot be traced by light.** 

**What will it do?**

- **Provide pictures of where galaxies are actually located in relation to one another in three-dimensional space**.
- It will be able to tell apart galaxies that appear clustered together but are actually millions of light years apart.

### **IISC-Bangalore develops ‘green’ tech to rid air filters of germs**

**Source:** [**The Hindu**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/iisc-bangalore-develops-green-tech-to-rid-air-filters-of-germs/article66284835.ece)

Context: A research team at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, has developed a **germ-destroying air filter that can inactivate germs using ingredients like polyphenols and polycationic polymers commonly found in green tea.**

**Why the need?**

With prolonged use, air **filters become a breeding ground for captured germs.** The growth of these germs **clogs the pores of the filter, reducing their life.**

**New Technology:**

- The air-filtering technique **was granted a patent in 2022.**
- It is found to be **24% effective against SARS-CoV-2 (delta variant).**
- The technology **was transferred to AIRTH**, a start-up that is replacing the existing germ-growing air filters.
- Can play a crucial role in the **fight against air pollution and mitigate the spread of air-borne pathogens such as several coronaviruses.**
