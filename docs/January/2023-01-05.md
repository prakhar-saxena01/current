### [50 ASI-protected monuments disappear](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/05/50-asi-protected-monuments-disappear/)

#### **GS Paper 1**

**Syllabus: Arts and Culture**

**Source:** [**Indian Express**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/asi-protected-monuments-untraceable-missing-8359347/)

 **Context**: The Ministry of Culture recently told Parliamentary Standing Committee that **50 of India’s 3,693 Centrally Protected Monuments (CPM)** were missing

- Previously in **2013, a CAG report** said that at least **92 centrally protected monuments** across the country had gone missing. But since then, 42 CPMs have been identified by ASI.
- **Examples of monuments missing**: Barakhamba Cemetery (Delhi), Guns of Emperor Sher Shah, Tinsukia (Assam); the Ruins of Copper Temple, Paya, Lohit (Arunachal Pradesh) etc.

**What are protected monuments?**

A protected monument means an **ancient monument** which is declared to be of **national importance** by or under the Ancient Monuments and Archeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958.

- AMASR Act regulates the **preservation of monuments and archaeological sites** of national importance
- The Act protects monuments and sites that are **more than 100 years old**, including temples, cemeteries, inscriptions, cannons, etc.
- According to the provisions of the AMASR Act, **ASI officials are supposed to regularly inspect the monuments**, assess their conditions, issue show cause notices for removal of any encroachment, etc.

**How can a monument go “missing”?**

**Many of the monuments documented more than a century ago can no longer be found at their designated sites. The reasons can be:** 

- **Government focus on the social issue rather than heritage: In the decade following the independence, the** focus of successive governments was on health, education and infrastructure, rather than protecting heritage.
    - Even within the scope of heritage, the aim was to **uncover more monuments** and sites, instead of conservation.
- **Rapid urbanization**: 14 monuments have been lost to rapid urbanisation
- **Submergence by reservoir/dams**: 12 are submerged by reservoirs/dams
- **Difficulties in tracing in remote locations**: 24 are untraceable

**Recommendations by the Standing Committee**

- **Mandatorily survey** **all the CPMs sites physically**: ASI had previously admitted that a comprehensive physical survey of all monuments has never been conducted after Independence
- **Provide budgetary allocation** and assess security requirements
- **Involving local community** including local Panchayats and Police
- **Use of technology such** as GPS, Geo-location, and Geo-tagging to trace monuments
- **Enhance manpower of ASI:** ASI currently faces an acute manpower shortage to physically man all the big and small monuments which may fall under a particular region

**Previous recommendation by CAG: A periodic inspection of each protected monument** be carried out by a suitably ranked officer.

**Can the ‘missing CPM’ be deleted from the List of national Monuments?**

- **Deleting the lost/untraceable monuments** from the protected list is possible but is **a long-drawn process**
- The deletion requires **denotification of the said monument under Section 35 of the AMASR Act.**
- However, **experts say that deleting untraceable monuments is not advisable** from the list, because once that is done, there would be no imperative to find them.

**About ASI:**

**Archeological Survey of India (ASI)** is an **attached office of the Ministry of Culture (MoC)** and is in charge of the protection and maintenance of centrally protected monuments (declared under **Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR)** Act, 1958).

- The ASI was founded in **1861 by Alexander Cunningham** when he realised the need for a permanent body to oversee archaeological excavations and conservation.
- **Lord Curzon (1899-1905) passed the law in 1904**(Ancient Monuments Preservation Act, 1904) that made the destruction of Ancient Monuments as an offence and directed officials to collect and preserve ancient monuments.

### [Rubber plantations in Tripura affecting monkeys, vegetation, suggests paper](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/05/rubber-plantations-in-tripura-affecting-monkeys-vegetation-suggests-paper/)

#### **GS Paper 1**

**Syllabus: Indian Geography**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/wildlife-biodiversity/rubber-plantations-in-tripura-affecting-monkeys-vegetation-suggests-paper-86942)

**Context:**  The research article, Impact of Monoculture Rubber Plantation on non-Human Primates and Plant Diversity in South Tripura, has warned against monoculture farms and suggest eco-friendly measures to increase biodiversity

**Major findings**:

- The conversion of tropical forests into monoculture plantations has a major effect on **non-human primates and plant species**.
    - g., **Turning the forests into natural rubber plantations** in Tripura is negatively impacting **non-human primate species and vegetation** in the region.
- **Humans are overusing the world’s tropical forests**: As per the WWF, every year, about 140,000 square kilometres of forests have been lost
    - **A large proportion of primary forest** in India has been converted into **monoculture plantations** like tea, oil palm, teak and natural rubber
- **Impact on animals:** The number of monkeys in the rubber plantation area is **much lower than** in the nearby forests and the primates spend less time in rubber plantations
    - Due to the **growing rubber plantations**, they do not get enough food, which makes their survival difficult. This threatens the **species and the primates can go extinct,** disrupting the environment’s natural state.

**What is the importance of Non-human primates?**

- Non-human primates are of central importance to **tropical biodiversity and various ecosystem**
- They are **humans’ nearest biological relatives** and play a significant role in many societies’ livelihoods, cultures and religions, the paper said.
- These primates help in the **pollination, seed dispersion and seed germination** of many plants and they are essential seed predators in some ecosystems.

**Solutions suggested**:

- **Building eco-friendly rubber plantations**: Growing fruiting plants in rubber plantation areas, maintaining specified distance, so animals are more attracted to them.
- **Various plants should also be kept intact** at the edges of the rubber plantation and around the water bodies, which provide shelter or food habitat for many animals in these areas
- **The agroforestry system allows rubber plants**, forest vegetation, and edible and useful plants planted together and kept at proper intervals, which is economically suitable and also will help conserve biodiversity.

**Other impacts of Monoculture farming:**

- Continuous monoculture, or “**monocropping**” where the **same species is grown year after year**, can lead to **unsustainable environments** such as building up **disease pressure** and reducing particular nutrients in the soil. Under certain circumstances, **monocropping** can lead to **deforestation**
- It reduces the **availability of certain nutrients and degrades the soil**. Monocultures may therefore also **lead to soil exhaustion** when the soil becomes depleted of these nutrients.

**Primates**: They are a member of the **most developed and intelligent group of mammals**, including humans, monkeys, and apes.

**Fourteen species of nonhuman primates occur in India**—six species of macaques, five of langurs, two of looses, and one species of **gibbon** (ape)

### [High-powered committee for Ladakh](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/05/high-powered-committee-for-ladakh/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus: Polity: 5th and 6th Schedule**

**Source:** [The Hindu](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/explained-why-has-a-high-power-ladakh-committee-been-formed/article66339539.ece)

**Syllabus**: Indian Constitution- historical underpinnings, evolution, features, amendments, significant provisions and basic structure

**Context**: Recently a **high-powered committee** has been formed in the **Union Territory of Ladakh**.

**Need for the committee:**

- There has been increasing demand for the **inclusion of Ladakh under the 6th**
- Civil society groups in Ladakh have been **demanding the protection of land, resources and employment for the past three years** after the special status of the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370.
- The committee will discuss measures to protect the **region’s unique culture and language** taking into consideration its **geographical location and strategic importance; ensure the protection of land and employment for the people of Ladakh;** strategies for inclusive development and discuss issues related to the empowerment of the Ladakh Autonomous Hill District Councils of Leh and Kargil.

**Sixth Schedule**

The sixth schedule under **Article 244** of the Constitution protects the **autonomy of tribal populations** through the creation of **autonomous development councils** which can frame laws **on land, public health and agriculture**. As of now, ten autonomous councils exist in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram.

**NCST Recommendation:**

- The National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST) has recommended that the **Union Territory (UT) of Ladakh be included in the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution.**

**Reasons behind the demand:**

- It is estimated that more than **90% of Ladakh’s population is tribal**. The primary Scheduled Tribes (STs) in Ladakh are **Balti Beda, Bot (or Boto), Brokpa (or Drokpa, Dard, Shin), Changpa, Garra, Mon and Purigpa.**
- The Ladakh region has several distinct cultural heritages by communities such as **Drokpa, Balti and Changpa, among others, which need to be preserved and promoted.**

**What is the government’s stand?**

- Not **keen to give any special status to Ladakh**, the **MHA informed a parliamentary standing committee** recently that the **objective for inclusion of the tribal population under the sixth schedule** is to ensure their overall socio-economic development, which, the **UT administration has already been taking care of and that sufficient funds are being provided to Ladakh to meet its overall developmental requirements**.
- The Ladakh administration recently increased the reservation for the Scheduled Tribes in direct recruitment from **10% to 45% which will significantly help the tribal population in their development.**

### [Ethical animal research](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/05/ethical-animal-research/)

#### **GS Paper 4**

**Syllabus: Applications of Ethics**

**Source:** [The Hindu](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/what-is-ethical-animal-research-a-scientist-and-veterinarian-explain/article66177724.ece)

**Context**: Globally **there is concern about ethical issues related to animal research. Recently, a** proposed measure in **Switzerland would have made that country the first to ban medical and scientific experimentation on animals** but it failed to pass with only 21% of voters in favour.

**About Animal research:**

Animal research or Experimentation involves the **use of animals to develop and test the safety of new medicines, drugs, cosmetics, medical procedures and other industry products**.

 **Ethical issues involved in animal research:**

- The moral status of an animal.
- Innate rights of animals
- Distinguish between testing on animals and infants or disabled humans
- The inability of the animals to consent.
- Lack of proven benefits to humans, out of these methods.

**Arguments in favour of Animal research:**

- Life-saving cures and treatments
- No proper alternative for testing.
- Overcome **ethical considerations** involved in the **use of human subjects**
- Shorter life cycles of animals.
- **Animal treatments** are developed during their experimentation

**Arguments against Animal research:**

- Time- and resource-intensive
- In many cases, do not correctly predict real-world human reactions and do not ensure safety
- **Anatomic, metabolic, and cellular differences** between animals and humans.

**Alternatives to animal testing:**

- In vitro methods i.e. **using human cell cultures and tissues**g. organs-on-a-chip
- In silico methods i.e. **advanced computer-modelling**
- Engagement of human volunteers
- **Using simulators** for medical training.

**Guidelines for Animal Research: As followed by Federal Agency and EU**

**Ethical aspects followed in other countries:**

In the U.S., the **Animal Welfare Act protects all warm-blooded animals except rats, mice and birds bred for research**. Rats, mice and birds are protected – along with fish, reptiles and all other vertebrates – by the **Public Health Service Policy.**

The basic national standards for humane treatment, research institutions across 47 countries, including the U.S., may seek **voluntary accreditation by a nonprofit called the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care**, or AAALAC International. AAALAC accreditation recognizes the maintenance of **high standards of animal care and** use.

**Conclusion:**

Animal research benefits both humans and animals. Numerous medical advances exist because they were initially studied in animals – from treatments for cancer and neurodegenerative disease to new techniques for surgery, organ transplants and non-invasive imaging and diagnostics.

### **Urban Forestry and Urban Greening in Drylands**

**Source**: [FAO](https://www.fao.org/3/cc2065en/cc2065en.pdf)

**Context**: **The food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)** has released this report, under the framework of **FAO’s Green Urban Oases Programme**

**Key points highlighted by the report:**

- **35% of the world’s largest cities** (including New Delhi, Mexico City etc.) are built on the world’s dryland
- **Urban policies** have yet to incorporate **forestry and greening strategies** in the majority of dryland cities

**Recommendations:**

- Select local trees for green spacing
- Build local capacity and involve the community to create a sense of ownership
- Create policies for urban greening

**About the Green Urban Oases (GUO) Programme:**

GUO program contributes to FAO’s Green Cities Initiative (2020) which aimed to improve the livelihoods of urban and peri-urban populations in at least 100 cities in the next 3 years.

**The objective of the programme**:

- Turn dryland cities into **“green urban oases**”
- **Strengthen their overall resilience** to climatic, health, food, and economic crisis
- **To reduce the impact of urbanization on biodiversity** and the surrounding natural environment

**What are drylands?**

**United Nations Environment Programme (**UNEP) defines drylands according to an **aridity index (AI),** which is the ratio between average **annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration**; drylands are lands with an AI of less than **0.65** (Zero Point six five)

Dryland systems **are ecosystems characterised by a lack of water**. They include cultivated lands, scrublands, shrublands, grasslands, savannas, semi-deserts and true deserts. It makes up around 41% of the earth’s land ( mainly in Asia and Africa).
