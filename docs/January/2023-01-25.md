### [Developing schools without barriers](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/25/developing-schools-without-barriers/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus:** Social empowerment

**Source:** [**The Hindu**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/developing-schools-without-barriers/article66427806.ece)

 **Direction**: Highlight issues and solutions that can be implemented to make schools inclusive for differently-abled children

**Issues affecting children with disability/disabilities (CWD):**

- **‘State of the Education Report for India 2019: Children with Disabilities’** by **UNESCO**mentioned that CWD **comprises 1.7%** of the total child population in India (Census 2011).
- **Physical**:
    - Inaccessible school buses
    - Inaccessible facilities in schools (drinking water facilities, canteens, and toilets)
    - Inappropriate infrastructure in classrooms (uncomfortable seating, slippery flooring, and low illumination)
- **Institutional**: Lack of policy implementation by agencies
- **Social**: Misinformed attitudes and perceptions among parents, teachers, staff, and communities
- **Communication** **barriers**
- **Economic** burden and lack of opportunities

**Solutions to deal with these issues:**

- **Policy level:**
    - **Actualizing the zero-rejection policy** in schools (e.g., as is done in Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan)
    - **Infrastructure should include**: Equitability, Usability, Durability, Affordability, Cultural adaptability, and Aesthetic appeal
- **Institutional Level:**
    - **Awareness and sensitization programmes** for children, parents, and caregivers
    - **Training trainers for upskilling of school** faculty and special educators
    - **Technical training for local government** departments
    - **A co-learning platform** for knowledge-sharing between all
- **Civil Society and organizations**:
    - **UN-Habitat India: ‘Leave No One Behind’ Project** (main pillar of Accessible India Campaign (Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan))
- ICT Solutions to Support **Universal Design for Learning**
- **Storybooks in local spoken** and **sign languages**

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus:** **Indian Economy and issues relating to Planning, Mobilization of Resources, Growth, Development and Employment**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/oxfam-inequality-report-taxing-obscenely-wealthy-may-not-right-solution-8391292/)

 **Direction:** The article highlights that instead of excessively taxing the wealthy, the need of the hour is to raise the income of all to reduce income inequalities.

**Context:**

- Evidence of “excessive” wealth concentration and uneven income growth is mentioned in the recently released **Oxfam “Survival of the Richest” report**.
- **The gap in income recovery** between the top income categories and those at the bottom as a result of the economic crisis post-COVID-19 pandemic.

**India-specific findings in the report:**

- There are now 166 billionaires, up from **106** in 2020.
- **The top (30%) earners hold the majority (90%) of the wealth.** This contrasts with the global figure, where it is believed that the richest 1% have amassed about two-thirds of all new wealth.

**Ramifications of the above findings:**

- This can stir the debate for an **equalising wealth tax** (a progressive wealth tax where the tax rate increases as the wealth of an individual increase. The goal is to redistribute wealth and reduce inequality among citizens.)
- Oxfam argues that indirect taxes are regressive and suggests –
    - A **wealth tax** – a tax on unrealised capital gains and higher taxes on corporates.
    - **Tax on incomes, capital gains and wealth are interrelated** and the changes cannot be recommended in isolation.

**Tax collection depends upon** The mix of taxes that a country raises as a function of its institutional capacity, the structure of the tax base and the desire for simplification.

**Case of India – The report raises two important points:**

- **The lower corporate tax rate** in lieu of incentives and the introduction of GST – a costly experiment of tax policy in India.
    - The corporate tax cuts brought the statutory tax rate down from 30 to 25.17%, leading to a revenue loss of Rs 1.03 lakh crore.
- **The GST and its disproportionate impact on the lowest earners.**
    - Oxfam uses NSS 2011-12 to establish that the **bottom 50% pays six times more indirect tax** as compared to the top 10%.
    - The current income tax system **exempts incomes up to Rs 5 lakh from tax and the GST rate structure places a higher burden on luxuries**.

**Issues with the Oxfam report’s calculation:**

- Although the report carries the right message about **rising inequalities and the need for tax reform**, it gets lost in assumptions.
    - **For example**, India will gain 10% more in taxes than it currently collects indirect taxes from the introduction of the wealth tax.
- A wealth tax has historically been utilised by nations, including India, **but the revenues were dismal**, making it an expensive tax to operate.
- Hence, **a compartmentalised approach to tax policy** that links several taxes that are levied against the same base is meaningless.

**Way ahead:** Taxes do not always solve problems, and **it is important to consider the impact of other macroeconomic measures** like low-interest rates and regulatory actions.

**Conclusion:** Rather than depending on a tax that depends heavily on volatile asset values, the same goal can be achieved with a gradual increase in wealth and income of all. This will **reduce inequalities without penalising the corporates.**

**InstaCurious:**

The **Gini index** measures the extent to which the distribution of income among individuals or households within an economy deviates from a perfectly equal distribution. A Gini index of 0 represents perfect equality, while an index of 100 implies perfect inequality. For India, it was **35.7 in 2019**(World Bank Data)

### [What ails the Ken-Betwa River link project?](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/25/what-ails-the-ken-betwa-river-link-project/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus:** **Issues related to the development**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/explained-what-ails-the-ken-betwa-river-link-project/article66419523.ece#:~:text=In%20December%202021%2C%20the%20Union,Bundelkhand%20region%20in%20Uttar%20Pradesh.)

 **D****irection:** The article highlights the issues related to the Ken-Betwa Link Project.

**Context:** The Steering Committee of the Ken-Betwa Link Project (KBLP), chaired by the Secretary of the Department of Water Resources, Ministry of Jal Shakti, held its third meeting in New Delhi.

**What is the KBLP?**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/mapping.jpg?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/mapping.jpg)

- It is a “flagship” project that is critical for the **water security and socio-economic development of the Bundelkhand region** (of MP and UP).
- The project costs Rs 44,605 crore in 2021 to water the Bundelkhand region.
- The link will be in the form of a **canal** (flow through Chhatarpur, Tikamgarh and Jhansi districts) that will be fed by the **new Daudhan Dam on the Ken**, to be built **within Panna Tiger Reserve**.
- The dam will generate **103 MW of hydroelectric power** and is expected to **irrigate 6.3 lakh hectares** of land every year.

**Concerns:**

- **Hydrological and ecological concerns:** The ‘surplus and deficit’ model has little basis in science (as these could be seasonal phenomena too) and it may **endanger the water security of the Panna district** (Ken – a non-perennial river).
    - The project has not yet received **a complete forest clearance**.
    - The NGT is currently hearing a challenge to the project’s environmental approval.
- **The legal problems:**
    - Approval by the National Board for Wildlife violates Section 35(6) of **the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972** – improvement and better management of wildlife.
    - According to the SC, the creation of a high reservoir dam on the Ken River in the Panna National Park and Tiger Reserve for the KBLP is ultra vires to the WPA 1972.
    - The destructive impact of the proposed dam on the flow of water into and outside of the **Ken Gharial Sanctuary** (downstream of the Panna national park) is evident.
- **Impact on Panna’s tigers and other wildlife:**
    - The deep gorges of Panna will be drowned if the new dam is built.
    - **By 2009**, there were no tigers in the Panna Tiger Reserve, **necessitating an incredible effort** that lasted almost a decade to reintroduce them.
    - The key wildlife species that will be affected include **endangered vultures, mahseer fish, and the critically endangered Gangetic gharial** (Gavialis gangeticus) in the Ken Gharial Sanctuary.

**Way ahead:**

- The government is developing a larger ‘**Panna Tiger Landscape**’, which should be created in any case for Panna’s tigers.
- An “**independent**” hydrological investigation of the Ken.
- **Restoring Bunderlkhand’s erstwhile Chandel-period lakes and ponds**.
- The developmental project should not destroy the ecology of fragile ecosystems and important tiger habitats in the country.
- The approach should be **eco-centric** and **not anthropocentric**.

**Conclusion:** Due diligence and expert scrutiny during the project-approval stage are cornerstones of sound environmental governance.

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus****:** Issues related to health.

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/food/5-billion-people-globally-exposed-to-toxic-trans-fat-linked-to-heart-disease-who-87276)

**Context**: **Five billion people globally are exposed to harmful trans-fat**, increasing their heart disease and death risk, according to a **new report “Countdown to 2023” by the World Health Organization (WHO).**

- The report monitors global progress **towards the 2023 target for the global elimination of industrially produced Trans-Fatty Acids (TFA).**

**About TFA:**

- TFAs are **unsaturated fatty acids** that are of two types –
    - **Naturally occurring trans-fat occurs in some dairy and meat products.**
    - **Industrially produced** trans-fat adds **hydrogen to liquid vegetable oils to make them more soli** It is found in packaged foods, baked goods, cooking oils and spreads.

**Key Findings from the report:**

- Trans fat intake is **accountable for up to 500,000 early deaths from coronary heart disease annually.**
- **Nine countries** — Australia, Azerbaijan, Bhutan, Ecuador, Egypt, Iran, Nepal, Pakistan and the Republic of Korea — of the 16 nations with the highest estimated percentage of coronary heart disease fatalities attributed **to trans-fat consumption** do not currently have best-practices strategy.
- **Two best-practices policy options**:
    - Mandatory **national limit of two grams** of industrially produced trans-fat per 100 grams of total fat in all foods;
    - Mandatory **national ban on the production or use of partially hydrogenated** oils (a major source of trans fat) as an ingredient in all foods.

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/best.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/best.png)**

**Harmful effects of TFA:**

- TFAs pose a **higher risk of heart disease than saturated fats** – they raise total cholesterol levels, and **reduce the good cholesterol (HDL), which helps to protect one against heart disease.**
- It is also associated with a higher risk of **developing obesity, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, infertility, and certain types of cancers**and can also lead to compromised fetal development causing harm to the yet-to-be-born baby.

**Steps taken to regulate TFA:**

**National:**

- FSSAI launched a “**Trans Fat-Free” logo for voluntary labelling** to promote TFA-free products in shops for preparations containing TFA not exceeding 0.2 per 100 g/ml.
- Campaign **“Heart Attack Rewind**” to eliminate industrially-produced trans-fat in the food supply by the year 2022.
- FSSAI limits the content to **not more than 2% by mass of total oils and fats from January 2022.**
- **Swasth Bharat Yatra, an initiative started under the “Eat Right” campaign** is a Pan-India cyclothon to engage citizens on issues of food safety, combating food adulteration and healthy diets.

**Global**:

- TFA **REPLACE strategy by WHO**.

**Case Study: Cuban HealthCare**

 **Context**: Recently, Cuban revolutionary Che Guevara’s daughter Aleida visited India.

**Success:**

- **Life expectancy in Cuba** is higher than that of the US (**72.****5 vs. 71.9) (India’s 70.19)**
- Cuba has eliminated **polio, tuberculosis, typhoid fever, and diphtheria**
- **Malnutrition** incidence among (1-15 years old) is **0..****7%** compared with 5% in the US
- Impressively **high ranking on major health indicators**, despite economic handicaps

**How has Cuba developed one of the best healthcare systems?**

- **Government-Run Healthcare:**
    - The Cuban government operates a **national health system**
    - The Cuban government has assumed **fiscal and administrative** responsibility for the health care of all its citizens.
    - **There are no private hospitals or clinics** as all health services are government-run.
    - It regards **accessibility to healthcare as a fundamental right** of its citizens.
- **Preventive Healthcare:**
    - Cuba’s health policy emphasizes **prevention, primary care, services** in the community, and the active **participation** of citizens.
    - It offers the simplest check-up to the most complex surgery, free of charge
- **India’s Connection:**
    - PM Modi’s **‘One Earth-One Health’ proposal** is inspired by the global health philosophy of the late Cuban leader Castro.
    - **Cuba sends surplus physicians (“Army of white coats”)** and health professionals abroad annually (including India): “Cuban doctors are always the first to arrive and the last to leave.”

**Quote on Healthcare**: Dr Martin Luther King once remarked, “**_Of the forms of injustice, inequality in healthcare is the most shocking and inhumane._**”

### **SEBI ban on Agri Commodity Trade**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/sebi-ban-agri-commodities-trade-farmers-8399662/)

 **ontext:** The farmer’s union, Shetkari Sanghatana, launched a protest over the Securities and Exchange Board of India’s (SEBI) decision to keep the trading of derivatives in seven agricultural commodities suspended.

**Background:**

- In 2021, the capital markets regulator suspended futures trading in seven commodities, viz., wheat, paddy (non-basmati), moong, chana, etc., on the exchanges, in an effort **to reduce food inflation**.
- The ban was intended to stop speculative trade in these commodities.

**How does the derivatives trade in commodities work?**

- Agricultural commodities like cotton, paddy, soybean, soya oil, mustard seed, etc., are traded on the National Commodities and Derivatives Exchange (**NCDEX**) and the Multi Commodity Exchange (**MCX**).
- **Derivatives are short-term financial contracts** that are bought and sold in the market.
- Profits are made **by predicting price movements** of the asset that underlies the contract.
- The derivatives trade can be in **futures and options. In a futures contract**, a supplier pledges to sell a certain quantity at a fixed price at a future date.
- Also, farmers can put fixed amounts of their produce, which fits the quality standards of the exchange, to be sold at a fixed price – a**lmost like price insurance.**
- Both contracts can be terminated by either the producer or the trader by paying a margin price to the exchange.

**Context:** In the wake of the energy crisis fueled by the Russia-Ukraine war, the **Geneva-based particle physics laboratory CERN,** known for discovering the ‘god particle’ in 2012, has reduced its energy intake.

- The laboratory has **shortened the running period of its Large Hadron Collider (LHC)** by a month

**What is LHC?**

**The Large Hadron Collider** is a giant, complex machine built to study particles that are the smallest known building blocks of all things.

- **Structure**: LHC is a **27-km-long track-loop buried 100m underground** on the Swiss-French border.
- **Operation**: In its operational state, it fires **two beams of protons** almost at the speed of light in opposite directions inside a ring of superconducting electromagnets.

**Achievements:**

- **‘God Particle’ discovery:** In scientists at CERN announced the discovery of the Higgs boson or the ‘God Particle’ during the LHC’s first run.
    - This led **to Peter Higgs and his collaborator François Englert** being awarded the Nobel Prize for physics in 2013.
- The Higgs boson is **the fundamental particle associated with the Higgs field, a field that gives mass to other fundamental particles such as electrons and quarks**.
- **‘New Physics’ beyond Standard Model:** After the discovery of the Higgs boson, scientists have started using the data collected as a tool to look beyond the **Standard Model**, which is currently the best theory of the most elementary building blocks of the universe and their interactions.
