### [Lessons from COVID: Jharkhand’s 1st survey of migrants](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/28/lessons-from-covid-jharkhands-1st-survey-of-migrants/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus:** **Governance, Indian Economy and issues relating to Planning, Mobilization of Resources, Growth, Development and Employment**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/lessons-from-covid-jharkhands-first-survey-of-migrants-8406842/)

 **Direction:** The article tries to give an overview of migration in India and the reasons for internal migration and the size of the migrant labour force, issues faced by them, etc.

**Context:** The first Jharkhand Migrant Survey (JMS) was recently conducted across 24 districts of the state.

**Background:**

- **Nearly 8.5 lakh migrant** workers belonging to the state travelled back to Jharkhand during the Covid crisis.
- The lessons from that journey have now prompted the state government to launch a key exercise for its migrant population,
    - **To map the major sectors of engagement for migrant workers,**
    - **Find the social security benefits** available to their families and
    - Identify the health hazards they face.
- The initiative is part of the state’s **Safe and Responsible Migration Initiative** (SRMI), which was launched in 2021-end and includes the preparation of a database of migrant workers.
- Jharkhand is not the only state to conduct migrant labour surveys. **Kerala has been a pioneer in this field**, followed by states like Tamil Nadu and Punjab.
- But there is a basic difference in labour movement between Kerala and Jharkhand. In Kerala, workers mostly go abroad (mainly to Gulf countries). However, the issue is **internal migration in Jharkhand.**

**Overview of Migration:**

- Migration is the **movement of people away from their usual place of residence**, across either internal (within the country) or international (across countries) borders.
- As per the 2011 Census data, India had **6 crore migrants in 2011** (38% of the population) compared to 31.5 crore migrants in 2001 (31% of the population).
- **99% of total migration was internal** and immigrants (international migrants) comprised 1%.
- **Internal migrant flows** can be classified on the basis of origin and destination.
    - One kind of classification is i) r**ural-rural (largest – 54%), ii) rural-urban, iii) urban-rural and iv) urban-urban**
    - Another way to classify migration is **(i) intra-state, and (ii) inter-state**. In 2011, intra-state movement accounted for almost 88% of all internal migration (39.6 crore persons).
    - As of 2011, UP (83 lakh residents) and **Bihar were the largest source of inter-state migran**ts while **Maharashtra (60 lakh people) and Delhi** were the largest receiver states.

**Reasons for internal migration and size of the migrant labour force:**

- Overall, 8% of people moved within a state for work (21% of male migrants and 2% of female migrants).
- Movement for work was **higher among inter-state migrants** – 50% of male and 5% of female interstate migrants.
- As per the Census, t**here were 5 crore migrant workers in 2011,** which, according to the Working Group Report on Migration, underestimates the migrant worker population.

Apart from this, one of the major reasons for inter-state or intra-state migration among **women** is **Mairrage** (Push factor).

**Issues faced by migrant labour:**

- **Article 19(1)(e) of the Constitution**, guarantees all Indian citizens the right to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India, subject to reasonable restrictions in the interest of the general public or protection of any scheduled tribe.
- However, people migrating for work face key challenges including:
    - **Lack of social security and health benefits** and poor implementation of minimum safety standards law,
    - **Lack of portability of state-provided benefits** especially food provided through the public distribution system (PDS) and
    - **Lack of access to affordable housing** and basic amenities in urban areas.

**Steps taken by the government with regard to migrant labour:**

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/steps.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/steps.png)**

**Way ahead: Four labour codes** – Code on Wages 2020, Industrial Relations Code 2020, Social Security Code 2020 and Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code 2020 – needs to be notified soon.

 **Conclusion:**

- In India, the **Concurrent List** includes the subject of labour. Therefore, it is necessary for the central and state governments to work together to develop a plan for the welfare of migrant workers.
- Before executing such a plan, **an accurate estimation of migrant workers** is required.

### [The Indus Waters Treaty, and why India has issued notice to Pakistan seeking changes](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/28/the-indus-waters-treaty-and-why-india-has-issued-notice-to-pakistan-seeking-changes/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus:** **International Relations**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/india-pakistan-notice-indus-waters-treaty-8408109/)

 **Direction:** The article covers the Indus Waters Treaty and why it is a bone of contention between India and Pakistan.  It also briefly covers the current state of India-Pak relations.

**Context:** New Delhi has issued a notice to Islamabad seeking modification of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT).

**Background:**

- The notice follows Pakistan’s continued “intransigence” in implementing the treaty, by raising repeated objections to the construction of hydel projects on the Indian side.
- India is **invoking** Article XII (3) of **the treaty** to bring changes to the 1960 pact.

**IWT and its dispute redressal mechanism:**

- IWT is **a water-distribution treaty between India and Pakistan**, brokered by the World Bank (WB), to use the water available in the Indus River and its tributaries. It is often cited as an example of **the possibilities of peaceful coexistence** despite the troubled relationship.
- **It was signed in Karachi in 1960** by then-Indian PM Jawaharlal Nehru and then-Pakistani president Ayub Khan.
- The Treaty gives control over the waters of the **three “eastern rivers” – the Beas, Ravi and Sutlej (BRS)- to India,** while control over the waters of the three **“western rivers**” – the **Indus, Chenab and Jhelum** -has been given **to Pakistan**.
- India has about 20% of the total water carried by the Indus system while Pakistan has 80%.
- The treaty **allows India to use the western river** waters for **limited irrigation use and unlimited non-consumptive** use for such applications as power generation.
- **India has the right to generate hydroelectricity through run-of-the-river (RoR) projects on the western rivers** which, subject to specific criteria for design and operation, is unrestricted.
- The dispute redressal mechanism provided under the IWT is a **graded** 3-level mechanism.
- Under the IWT, whenever India plans to start a project, it has to inform Pakistan. The concerns have to be cleared at the levels of the **Indus Commissioners → Neutral Expert → Court of Arbitration**, in a graded manner.

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/indus-660x1024.jpg)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/indus.jpg)

**The history of the dispute over the hydel projects:**

- There has been **a longstanding dispute over two hydroelectric power projects** – one on the Kishanganga river (a tributary of Jhelum) and the other on the Chenab (Ratle).
- Pakistan has raised objections to these projects, and **dispute resolution mechanisms under the Treaty have been invoked multiple times**. But a resolution has not been reached.
- In 2022, the WB announced to concurrently appoint **a Neutral Expert and a Chair of the Court of Arbitration** to resolve the dispute, which as per India poses practical and legal challenges.
    - Pakistan had demanded the constitution of a **Court of Arbitration**, while India demanded a **Neutral Expert** to resolve the dispute.

**What conclusions can be drawn from India’s most recent decisions?**

- India has not fully utilised its rights over the waters of the Indus system.
- Over the last few years, especially since the Uri attack, there has been a growing demand in India **to use the IWT as a strategic tool**, considering that India has a **natural advantage being the upper riparian state**. In the aftermath of the Uri attack, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said**_, ‘blood & water can’t flow together at the same time.’_**
- Accordingly, India has been working to start several big and small hydroelectric projects that had either been stalled or were in the planning stages.

The treaty has remained “uninterrupted” because India respects its signatory and **values transboundary rivers as an important connector in the region in terms of both diplomacy and economic prosperity.**

India-Pakistan relations:

**The current state:**

●        **Prior to 2016**: Characterised by intense engagement, terror attacks, Indian responses, a breakdown of talks and eventual resumption of talks.

●        **Post-2016**:  The Pathankot airbase attack followed by a terror attack in Uri, prompted India to respond via ‘**Surgical Strikes”** and practical ‘Freezing of Relations’.

●        **Pulwama Terror Attack (2019):** India retaliated through the **Balakot airstrike**.

●        **Abrogation of Article 370:** further deepened the divide.

●        Age of **C****old peace**:  on the Line of Control, inside Kashmir and in the verbal exchanges between the two sides.

○        A state of relative peace between two countries characterised by mistrust and hostile internal policies between the two governments and citizens is referred to as **cold peace.**

●        **Indications of improved relations:** thanks to **cricket diplomacy**, India may visit Pakistan in 2023 following a 15-year gap.

●        **Pakistan’s PM wish to offer a white flag to India** in a recent interview for the betterment of the Pakistani economy and its people.

●        **India’s invitation to Pak PM** after 12 years to attend a high-level SCO meet being hosted by India at Goa.

 **Key challenges ahead for India-Pak relations:**

●        **The China-Pakistan axis in Asian geopolitics:** Pakistan and Chinese leaders describe their ties using metaphors such as **“higher than the mountains” and “deeper than the oceans”.** Pakistan’s economic dependence on Beijing has increased in recent years. **Due to Pakistan’s current economic crisis** as a result of declining foreign exchange reserves and mounting debt, India may face growing Chinese influence in South Asia as a whole and Pakistan in particular (CPEC).

●        Terror atmosphere: brooded by Pakistan is hampering India’s efforts to peace.

**Conclusion:**

Multilateral settings are often viewed as opportunities for countries with problematic relations to find a way forward. India should utilise this opportunity to iron out differences with Pakistan.

### [Fighting The Big G](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/28/fighting-the-big-g/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus: Indian Economy**

**Source**: [TOI](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-editorials/fighting-the-big-g-googles-walled-garden-business-model-is-being-slowly-dismantled-thats-good-for-digital-economy/)

**Context**: Google this week began to change the **business model used in India** to push its Android operating system (OS) and the Google Play Store.

- The change was triggered by the **Supreme Court setting January 26** as the deadline for Google to comply with the Competition Commission of India’s rulings.

**The Changes made by Google:**

- In the new model, **instead of creating a bouquet of apps**, smartphone makers can license individual apps from Google.
- Google’s search engine **will not necessarily** be the default setting

**What is the ‘****walled garden approach****’ adopted by Google:**

Android’s dominance (under-walled garden approach) is based on a complex model of cross-subsidies. Google offers free services such as a search engine and email, thereby making a huge user base. This user base is then monetised for **advertising revenue**. **Even** **third-party apps** cannot all wish away Google. Google controls both sides of this advertising ecosystem- the users as well as third-party app developers, making it a walled garden.

**Other initiatives taken to break Google’s monopoly:**

- **South Korea**: It imposed curbs on the **proprietary billing system** of Google and Apple.
- **EU’s upcoming Digital Markets Act**: It will prevent “**gatekeepers**” from engaging in anti-competitive behaviour. It will no longer be business as usual for the **Android OS ecosystem**

Previously, the **Competition Commission of India (CCI)** had imposed a penalty ( and upheld by the supreme court) on Alphabet-owned Google for “**abusing its dominant position**” in markets related to the Android mobile device ecosystem.

- The CCI stated that **Google contravened competition law** due to mandatory pre-installation of the entire **Google Mobile Suite (GMS)**and there was no option to uninstall the same.

**What are anti-trust laws?** 

**Antitrust laws are regulations** that encourage competition by **limiting the market power of any particular firm**. Essentially, these laws prohibit business practices that unreasonably deprive consumers of the benefits of competition, resulting in higher prices for products and services. In India, The Competition Act, 2002 regulates such activities.

About CCI

The Competition Commission of India (CCI, constituted in **2009**) is a **statutory body** of the Government of India responsible for enforcing the Competition Act, 2002. The **Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1969 (MRTP Act)** was repealed and replaced by the **Competition Act, 2002**, on the recommendations of the **Raghavan committee**.

- It consists of **one Chairperson and six Members**who shall be appointed by the Central Government.
- **The Competition Act, 2002 (amended in 2007) prohibits anti-competitive agreements**, and abuse of dominant position by enterprises and regulates combinations (acquisition, acquiring of control and M&A), which cause or are likely to cause an appreciable adverse effect on competition within India.

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus:** **Environment, Conservation**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-inks-pact-with-south-africa-to-bring-cheetahs/article66438846.ece#:~:text=India%20has%20signed%20an%20agreement,by%20February%2015%2C%20he%20said.)

 **Direction:** The article highlights the significance of cheetah reintroduction in India.

 **Context:** India has signed an agreement with South Africa to translocate 12 cheetahs (seven male and five female) to the **Kuno Palpur National Park (KNP)** in Madhya Pradesh.

**Background:**

- ‘Cheetah’ **(_Acinonyx Jubatus Venaticus_)** originates from Sanskrit and means **‘the spotted one’**.
- The Cheetah is the **fastest land animal in the world**.
- Its **historical range** includes the **majority of Sub-Saharan Africa and extends eastward to India.**
- It is the **only large carnivore** that went ‘Extinct’ in India **due to overhunting and habitat loss.**
- The last cheetah died in the Koriya district of present-day Chhattisgarh in 1947 and the species was declared extinct in **1952**.
- According to the Wildlife Institute of India’s (WII) “**Action Plan for Reintroduction of Cheetah in India**,” **50 wild cheetahs** that are ideal for starting a new cheetah population would be imported as a founder stock over five years initially.
- The PM of India released the **first batch of eight cheetahs** (five females and three males) from Namibia into a quarantine enclosure at Kuno last year.
- Some modifications have been made to the current **bomas** (wildlife cages constructed often for the treatment or quarantine of animals).

**Significance of reintroducing cheetahs:**

- In- situ Conservation of species.
- **Beneficial to the entire ecosystem** → save its prey base comprising certain threatened species and endangered species of the grasslands and open forest ecosystems.
- They pose **no danger to humans** or large livestock.

**Why is KNP given the highest priority for reintroduction?**

- Suitable habitat and adequate prey base.
- Assessed to be capable of supporting 21 cheetahs.
- **Devoid of human settlements:** Villages have been completely relocated from within the park.
- **Enables the coexistence of the four big cats** found in India – the tiger, lion, leopard, and cheetah, as they have in the past.

**Why are cheetahs coming from Africa?**

- Asiatic cheetahs found in Iran are categorised as critically endangered.
- The **highest genetic variation**, which is essential for a founding population stock, is found in African cheetahs.
- African cheetahs have been determined to be **the ancestors of all other Cheetah**

 **Source**: [BS](https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/asi-should-come-up-with-substantive-criteria-eac-on-national-monuments-123012600661_1.html#:~:text=%22Archaeological%20Survey%20of%20India%20(ASI,)%2C%22%20the%20report%20said.)

**Context**: The **Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM)** has suggested that the government should come up with a **detailed procedure for declaring ‘Monuments** of National Importance’ (MNI)

 **K****ey points from the report titled ‘Monuments of National Importance – Urgent Need for Rationalisation’:**

- **Absence of definition of term ‘National Importance’**
- **Allocation of funds** for the protection of MNI should be increased
- ASI should **publish a book of notifications** for all MNI
- **Remove unimportant ones:**g. around 75 British cemeteries/graves are considered as MNI currently.
- **24 monuments** of national importance are **untraceable,** but still considered as MNI
- **Minor monuments and antiquities** should be **denotified** as MNI and monuments with local importance should be transferred to **respective states for protection**
- **Over 60 per cent of MNI are located in just 5 states** – Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. While the city of Delhi alone has 173 MNI

**India currently has 3,695 MNI** that are under the protection of **ASI**. The **Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act (AMASR Act), 1958, (amended in 2010)** provides for the declaration and conservation of ancient and historical monuments and archaeological sites and remains of national importance. **The Central Government** is authorised to maintain, protect and promote the monuments.

**Criteria for declaration of the monument as national importance**

- Ancient monument or archaeological site is **not less than 100 years old**
- It has a **special historical, archaeological or artistic** interest
- **No objection** from interested public

### **Ramcharitmanas of Tulsidas**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/ramcharitmanas-of-tulsidas-and-criticism-of-the-holy-book-8408589/)

 **Context:** In news due to a recent controversial statement made by a state minister against Ramcharitmanas.

**The Ramcharitmanas:**

- The **poem** was written in the **16th century** in the **Awadhi**
- It is divided into **seven chapters** (Kand) that tell the **story of Lord Ram from birth to his becoming King of Ayodhya**.
- The Ramcharitmanas is based on the **Ramayana** – sage Valmiki’s great epic.

**Goswami Tulsidas:**

- Tulsidas, a Brahmin whose original name was **Ram Bola Dubey**, composed the **Ramcharitmanas** on the bank of the Ganga in Varanasi.
- Tulsidas was a contemporary of **Emperor Akbar**, and it is believed that he was in touch with Abdurrahim Khan-e-Khanan, the son of Akbar’s commander **Bairam Khan.**
- Tulsidas made the story of Lord Ram popular among the masses because he wrote in the **regional dialect that most people understood**.
- This attracted the wrath of ancient Sanskrit scholars, and Tulsidas recorded his pain in his **Kavitawali**.

**Pashmina:**

- The term ‘Pashmina’ has been derived from the Persian word “Pashm” meaning **wool**.
- It is a **GI-certified wool** that has its origin in the **Kashmir** region of India.
- Due to the high quality of the wool used and the labour-intensive process required to make each individual piece, pashmina shawls are **quite expensive.**
- **The Changthangi goats** (Capra Hircus), domesticated in Ladakh, are the source of the wool used to weave Pashmina Shawls.
- The C**hangpa tribes** of Ladakh who herd the Changthangi goats harvest the raw Pashm.

**Shahtoosh:** It is the name given to the wool of the Tibetan chiru (Endangered in the IUCN Red List) antelopes.

### **Genetically Engineered Trees**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/environment/a-wild-thought-are-genetically-engineered-trees-really-the-future--87154)

 **Context: USA is debating** whether to allow a **genetically engineered (GE) version** of the American chestnut tree (currently functionally extinct) to spread in the wild.

- The US has already developed and field tested the GE version, **known as Darling 58**, and is now awaiting clearance from government agencies to grow them in the wild.
- **The population of the American chestnut**, a deciduous tree native to North America, dwindled in the first half of the 20th century when a fungal blight, **_Cryphonectria parasitica_**, killed over four billion trees.

**Initiatives by other countries for GE Trees:**

- **China allows commercial plantation of GE Poplar Tree (insect-resistant)**
- **India experimenting with GE Rubber tree( extreme climatic stress-tolerant):** This is made possible by inserting **MnSOD gene** (manganese-containing Superoxide Dimutase)

**What are GE Trees?**

A genetically modified tree (GMt, GM tree, genetically engineered tree, GE tree or transgenic tree) is **a tree whose DNA has been modified using genetic engineering techniques**. It can help in fighting climate change by sequestering more carbon; boost biofuel production;  help in growing more timber, pulp etc.

**Concerns**: GE Trees may contaminate other trees along with animals; also not many scientific studies done on the long-term impact of GE trees

 **Context**:  The Aditya-L1 mission will be launched by ISRO to the L1 orbit (which is the first Lagrangian point of the Sun-Earth system)

- Aditya-L1 is the first Indian space mission to observe the Sun and the solar corona
- **L1 orbit allows** Aditya-L1 to look at the Sun continuously
- It will be launched aboard **a PSLV-XL launch vehicle**

**The objective of the mission:**

To study solar upper **atmospheric (chromosphere and corona) dynamics** and understand the physics of the solar corona and its heating mechanism.

**Payloads:** 

Aditya-L1 has seven payloads in total, of which the primary payload is the **Visible Emission Line Coronagraph(VELC)**.

- VELC is a solar coronagraph capable of simultaneous **imaging, spectroscopy and spectro-polarimetry**
- **Significance**: No other solar coronagraph in space has the ability to image the solar corona as close to the solar disk as VELC can. It can image it as close to 1.05 times the solar radius.

**About Lagrange points:**

**The Lagrange points are points of equilibrium for small-mass objects** under the influence of two massive orbiting bodies. At Lagrange points, the **gravitational pull of two large masses precisely equals** the **centripetal force** required for a small object to move with them. These points in space can be used by spacecraft to reduce fuel consumption needed to remain in position.

### **Kelp forests losing unique traits due to climate change**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/climate-change/kelp-forests-losing-unique-traits-due-to-climate-change-says-study-87331#:~:text=Published%3A%20Wednesday%2025%20January%202023&text=Kelp%20forests%20provide%20underwater%20habitats,researchers%20wrote%20in%20the%20paper.)

 **Context:**

- According to a new study, **Kelp forests (l**arge **brown algae seaweeds**) are declining because of climate change.

**What is a Kelp Forest?**

- They are **underwater** ecosystems formed in **shallow water** by the dense growth of several different species.

- **Kelp can also persist at lower latitudes**, aided by cool water upwelling or in deep-water refugia where they are protected by thermocline (_transition layer between the warmer surface water and the cooler deep water_).
- **Keystone Species**: They provide underwater **habitats to hundreds of species** and thus have great **ecological and economic value.**
- **Provide Ecosystem Services: such as coastal protection and carbon sequestration.**
- They also provide **recreational and tourism value** for scuba diving, snorkelling, and kayaking.
- Their loss will lead to a decline in the unique biodiversity that they support.

**Findings of the study:**

- Kelp populations at **equatorward-range edges** are **most vulnerable to climate change** as these locations are undergoing warming beyond **thermal tolerance thresholds**.
- The unique adaptive **genetic diversity** that the rear-edge populations (populations in warm, low-latitudes) may contain **is also under threat due to rapid warming.**

**What is the thermal tolerance threshold?**

**The ability of an organism to withstand high temperatures after prior exposure to moderate temperatures. For example,** _Ecklonia radiata_, the dominant and most widely distributed Laminarian kelp in the southern hemisphere, rapidly succumb to warmer temperatures in spring and summer when temperatures exceed 27 degrees Celsius.

**Way ahead:** Kelp forests are incredibly important ecosystems that are worth protecting and preserving for their **ecological, economic, and social benefits**. To ensure that genetic diversity is protected, it is essential to identify refuge areas, which are places that support a lone or extinct population of a once more common species.

**InstaCurious:**

Kelp forests are often referred to as **“underwater rainforests**” because of their high biodiversity and productivity.
