**Conclusion:**

As we celebrate the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav, let us also recall how the **Gandhian values of non-violence, inclusiveness and communal harmony enabled India to establish a unique democracy** achieving momentous economic and social transformation through the ballot box rather than through the barrel of the gun**.**

**Insta Curious:**

 **World Leprosy Day** always takes place on the last **Sunday** of January. This date was chosen by French humanitarian, **Raoul Follereau** as a tribute to the **life of Mahatma Gandhi**, who did much work with persons affected by leprosy and died at the end of January 1948.

### [Coal India Ltd to Launch M-Sand Projects in a Big Way](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/30/coal-india-ltd-to-launch-m-sand-projects-in-a-big-way/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus: Science and Technology, Environment Conservation**

**Source**: [PIB](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1894047)

 **Context**: Coal India Ltd (CIL) has envisaged processing the **fragmented rock (known as Overburden Rocks (OB)** for sand production in mines.

- **OB material** contains about **60% sandstone by volume** which is harnessed through crushing and processing of Overburden.

**What is M Sand?**

M sand is a form of **artificial sand, manufactured by crushing large hard stones**, mainly rocks or granite, into fine particles, which are then washed and finely graded. It is widely used as a **substitute for river sand** for construction purposes, mostly in the production of concrete and mortar mix.

**Need for M Sand**

- **Due to high demand**, regulated supply and a complete ban on sand mining during monsoon to protect the river ecosystem, finding an alternative to river sand became necessary.
- **The Supreme Court** banned illegal mining on riverbeds in 2017
- **Sand Mining Framework (2018)** prepared by the Ministry of Mines envisages alternative sources of sand in the form of Manufactured Sand (M-Sand) from crushed rock fines (crusher dust), and sand from Overburden (OB) of coal mines.

**Why Coal India Ltd?**

During **Opencast mining** of Coal India, the o**verlying soil and rocks are removed as waste to extract coal and the fragmented rock** (Overburden or OB) is heaped in dumps. Most of the waste is disposed of at the surface which occupies a considerable land area and requires extensive planning and control to minimize the environmental impact of mining.

**Difference between M Sand and Natural River sand** 

**[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/sand.jpg?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/sand.jpg)**

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/sand_1.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/sand_1.png)**

**Process of extraction of M-Sand:**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/sand_2-1.jpg?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/sand_2-1.jpg)**[](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/sand_2.jpg)**

**Benefits of Manufactured Sand (M-Sand):**

- **Cost-effectiveness**: As it can be produced in large quantities at a lower cost.
- **Consistency**: in grain size and shape, which can be beneficial for construction projects that require a specific type of sand.
- **Environmental benefits**: Helps reduce the need for mining natural sand, which can have negative environmental impacts.
    - Additionally, **using the overburden from coal mines** can help to repurpose materials that would otherwise be considered waste.
    - **Lesser Sand extraction from the river** will reduce erosion of channel beds & banks and protect the water habitat
    - Help **maintain the water table**

- **Reduced water consumption:** This helps reduce the amount of water required for construction projects, as it does not require washing before use.
- **Better workability**: Since it’s more angular and has a rougher surface, which makes it more workable for construction projects.

**Concerns regarding M Sand:**

- **Due to its smooth and angular textures**, it leads to more water and cement requirements to achieve the expected workability, thereby increase in overall costs.
- If the M Sand contains a **large number of micro fine particles**, it can affect the **strength** and **workability** of concrete.

**About Sand:**

**Sand** is a mixture of small grains of rock and granular materials which is mainly defined by size, being finer than **gravel** and coarser than **silt**.

- Sand is classified as a **“minor mineral”,** under The Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulations) Act, 1957 (MMDR Act)
- **Administrative control** over minor minerals vests with the **State Governments**

### [In Good Faith: Pranam vs Pramana — why faith and science must co-exist](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/30/in-good-faith-pranam-vs-pramana-why-faith-and-science-must-co-exist/)

#### **GS Paper 4**

**Syllabus****: Ethics and Human Interface**

**Source****:** [**Indian Express**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/pranam-vs-pramana-why-faith-and-science-must-co-exist-8404676/)

 **Direction**: The article highlights the **difference between science & religion** & how they can co-exist for the development of all.

**Context**: The Covid-19 pandemic saw **widespread use of science**, but it also provided a **fertile ground for promoting faith and questioning science.** 

**Difference between Science and Religion:**

- **Freedom to Question vs. Blind Acceptance:** In a science-based society, unlike in a faith-based society, **people have the freedom to question, seek answers and then choose their way forward** based on their own understanding & assessment.
- **Acceptance of Change:** Another important difference **pertains to the acceptance of the change.** Science thrives on change. Whereas, faith and dogma are constants and don’t accept questioning.
- **Constant change in Science vs. Constancy in Tradition:** What was scientifically appropriate at a given time and has become a tradition, **may change at a later stage**. **This constant change in scientific thinking is often pointed out as its weakness, and constancy as a strength of tradition**.

**Etymology of Pranam and Pramana:**

- **Pranam**: derived from Sanskrit- “pra” means “**forward, outward, in front, before”** while “ānama” means “**bending or stretching**”. Together, pranama **means “bending, bowing in front**” or “prostration”. It’s a common **Hindu traditional custom of greeting a person.**
- **Pramana**(Sanskrit word), **means “proof” and adds “mā” which means measurement to the “pra” and alludes to the concept of objectivity and science**. It’s the means that **can lead to knowledge**. Three of the many pramanas are **pratyakṣa (eyewitness/personal experience), anumāna (logical inference), and śabda (expert opinion).**

**Examples of how faith undermines Science:**

- **Taboos related to menstruation**: Rather than treating it as a biological phenomenon, a lot **of semi-religious customs have been built around it, all adversely affecting a girl’s health.**
- Health issues around **childbirth, breastfeeding, and contraception**. New mothers often find it difficult to navigate when caught between a **doctor’s scientific advice on breastfeeding (as early as possible, giving of colostrum, exclusivity, no pre-lacteal feed) and traditional customs recommended by the elders(waiting till a family member washes breast, use of ghutti, jaggery water, discarding of colostrum)**.
- Access **to safe abortions:** a fight between faith and science.
- **Heliocentric vs Geocentric theory:** The latter says that the earth is at the centre of the universe, and the planets, the sun, the moon, and the stars circle around it. While, heliocentric models consider the sun as the centre, and the planets revolve around the sun.
- **The banned practice of Sati.**
- **Racism –** Aryan theory to be superior.   
    

**Examples of when science prevails:**

- Acceptance of vaccines and modern contraceptive methods
- A scientific theory is **that all humans are the same species** – everyone has red blood and the same internal organs.

**Platforms for dialogue & harmonious coexistence between the 2 critical pillars of society:**

- Teachers or parents, should **encourage children to ask questions and give them access to resources to enable them to decide for themselves**.
- Health professionals **must not belittle faith**.
- We need to **understand the need for both for our societal well-being**. & have more **faith in science as a solver to our pressing problems.**

**InstaCurious:**

**In today’s society, the 3 forms of** _**pramana**_ **are under threat due to the rise of:**

- **Confirmation Bias**
- **Echo Chambers &** **filter bubbles.**
- **Post-Truth** society

### **Manipur’s traditional theatre form of Shumang Leela**

**Source**: [The Hindu](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/in-frames-the-art-of-gender-bending/article66446184.ece#:~:text=Manipur's%20traditional%20theatre%20form%20of,and%20entertain%20down%20the%20ages&text=Shumang%20Leela%20is%20a,men%20are%20played%20by%20women.)

 **Context**: Shumang Leela is a traditional form of **theatre in Manipur** where the roles of women are all played by men, called **Nupi Shabis**.

- In the case of women’s theatre groups, the roles of men are played by women.

 **A****bout Shumang Leela:**

- **‘Shumang’** means ‘open courtyard’and **‘Leela’** means play and the literal meaning of Shumang Leela is “play of the open courtyard”.
- **Origin**: It started as a comic genrepresented before the kings and noblemen, which ultimately developed into the present form of courtyard-enacted play.

**Context**: **Tibeto-Burman communities** were pre-historic Himalayan settlers, and their East Asian ancestry can be traced back to **Neolithic immigration**, mostly from Tibet around 8000 Years Ago, says a genetic study of the population.

**Impact of this migration**: The migration led to genetic drift, endogamy, admixture, isolation, and natural selection that have contributed to genetic diversity among the Nepalese population

 **Origin of Modern Human**

Modern humans originated in Africa within the past 200,000 years and evolved from their most likely recent common ancestor, Homo erectus (‘upright man’)

### **Supreme Court presses the need for reform on tedious bail processes**

 **Source**: [TH](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/supreme-court-presses-need-for-reform-on-tedious-bail-processes/article66443774.ece)

 **Context**: Judge says that unless the government thinks **“out of the box”** and refrains from fighting every case of bail, it could take the **top court 300 to 700 years to dispose** of the current backlog

**What is bail?**

 Bail is the temporary release of a person accused of a crime in exchange for a monetary pledge in exchange for the accused’s appearance in court when the time comes.

- The person who **pays the money or undertakes a money bond** acts as the surety.

**Issues with the Bail processes:**

- **Almost every case of bail** is being **challenged** all the way to the Supreme Court, forming more than **one-third of the cases** in the Supreme Court
- **A huge number of under-trials**: As per NCRB data over **77% of prisoners** are under trial in India
- **Supreme Court decided to give priority to pending bail petitions** by having every Bench of the court hear 10 bail cases every day before normal work.

In July last year (2022), a Supreme Court judgment urged the government to bring a **new Act exclusively to simplify and streamline bail**.

**Legal aspects:**

- The CrPC **does not define the word bail** but only categorises offences under the Indian Penal Code as ‘bailable’ and ‘non-bailable’.
    - It empowers **magistrates** to grant bail for bailable offences as a matter of right.
- **Articles applicable:** Article 20 (Protection against indiscriminate arrest); Article 21 (Protection of Life and Personal Liberty); Article 22 (Protection Against Arrest and Detention)

**_Quote:_**

- **_“In a democracy, there can never be an impression that it is a Police State”_**
- **Rule of “bail, not jail”**

**With reference to India, consider the following statements: (UPSC 2021)**

1. Judicial custody means an accused is in the custody of the concerned magistrate and such an accused is locked up in a police station, not in jail.
2. During judicial custody, the police officer in charge of the case is not allowed to interrogate the suspect without the approval of the court.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only  
(b) 2 only  
(c) Both 1 and 2  
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Answer: B**

In Judicial custody, an accused is in the custody of the concerned Magistrate and lodged in jail. Hence, statement 1 is not correct.

### **XR Startup Program**

 **Source**: [PIB](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1894084)
