**Context:**  Archeological Survey of India (ASI) has discovered **two 1200-year-old miniature votive stupas** during landscaping activities near Sarai Tila mound on the premises of ‘Nalanda Mahavihara’, a world heritage site in Nalanda district.

- The stupas, carved from stone, depict Buddha figures.

**What are stupas?**

A Stupa is a hemispherical structure which **symbolizes the burial mound of Buddha**. It rose to prominence after the advent of Buddhism and peaked during **Ashoka’s reign**. Stupas evolved as **Chorten in Tibet and pagodas in East Asia**.

**What is a votive stupa?**

The form of the stupa, with its distinctive domelike drum, **originates in eight cylindrical structures in which the Buddha’s relics were placed after his death**.

- **Votive stupas were offered in fulfilment of a vow**. Beginning in the **7th century CE in India**, small miniature terracotta stupas became popular as votive offerings.

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/stupa.jpg?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/stupa.jpg)**

### [Green steel](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/14/green-steel/)

#### **GS Paper 1**

**Syllabus: Geography/ Environment/ Science and Steel**

**Source:** [**DTE**](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/renewable-energy/-green-steel-cement-for-clean-energy-not-yet-there-says-iea-here-s-why-87118)

**Context: I**ntergovernmental organisation International Energy Agency has released a document saying that **most net-zero emission (NZE) routes** for **steel and cement production** are not yet commercially available including for ‘**green steel’**

**What is Green Steel?**

Green Steel is the manufacturing of steel using **renewable or low-carbon energy sources** such as hydrogen, coal gasification, or electricity instead of the traditional carbon-intensive manufacturing route of coal-fired plants.

**What does the document of IEA say?**

- Key technologies such as **carbon capture, utilisation and storage for cement and steel industries** and hydrogen-based steel manufacturing are still in prototype and demonstration stages.
- Experience shows that the innovation process usually takes **20 to 70 years from prototype to commercialization**
- **Solar and wind energy units require more steel, aluminium** and in some cases, cement per unit of capacity than fossil fuel-based generating technologies.
- **Energy resources being concentrated in one geographical area** pose a threat to the world’s energy security
- Currently, China is the dominant producer of **solar panels, wind, Electric Vehicle (EV) batteries, electrolysers** and heat pumps.
- **Lithium**, a key metal for producing electronic vehicles, is mostly concentrated in **Australia, Chile and China**. Meanwhile, **70 per cent of the world’s cobalt** is produced in the Republic of Congo.

**Government programmes for green steel:**

- **National Hydrogen Energy Mission (NHM**) capitalizes on hydrogen for a cleaner alternative fuel option
- **Petroleum and Natural Gas Ministry launched Pradhan Mantri Urja Ganga Project**in Eastern India in 2019 to provide gas to all steel plants located in the area

### [Case in Supreme Court: Can an underage Muslim girl marry after attaining puberty?](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/14/case-in-supreme-court-can-an-underage-muslim-girl-marry-after-attaining-puberty/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus:** **Laws, institutions and Bodies constituted for the protection of vulnerable sections**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/supreme-court-to-examine-whether-an-underage-muslim-girl-can-marry-after-attaining-puberty-what-is-the-case-8380620/#:~:text=The%20Supreme%20Court%20on%20Friday,her%20choice%20after%20attaining%20puberty.)

 **Direction:** The article discusses the issue of the age of marriage in India and the challenges as the legal age of marriage is not uniform across communities.

**Context:** The SC agreed to examine whether girls as young as 15 years old can enter into marriage on the basis of custom or personal law although such marriages are illegal under statutory law.

**Background:**

- Last year, Punjab and Haryana HC declared in a Habeas Corpus petition that a Muslim girl is free to marry whoever she wants **after reaching puberty** if she is under the age of 18.
- **The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights** (NCPCR) had moved the SC against the HC ruling, arguing that the HC’s ruling essentially allowed a child marriage violating the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, which is secular legislation.
- While agreeing to hear an appeal on the case, a bench headed by the Chief Justice of India said that the **HC’s decision should not be relied on as a precedent in any other case**.
- The SC’s intervention opens up the **issue of regulating the minimum age of marriage for women** and the impact it has on personal law.

**How is the age for marriage determined in India?**

- **Personal laws** that govern marriage for communities prescribe certain criteria for marriage, **including age**.
- For example, **The Hindu Marriage Act, of 1955**, sets a minimum age of 18 for the bride and 21 for the groom (same for Christians under the Indian Christian Marriage Act, 1872 and the Special Marriage Act).
- **For Muslims**, the criterion is attaining puberty, which is assumed when the bride or groom turns 15.
- This means that the legal age of marriage is **not uniform across communities.**

**Laws for the prohibition of child marriage:**

- **The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006:** Any marriage below the prescribed age is illegal and the perpetrators of forced child marriage can be punished.
    - But the law **does not have any provision that says the law would override** any other laws on the issue.
    - Also, child marriages are illegal but not void and they are voidable at the option of the minor party.
- **The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012:** The law does not recognise consent for sexual activity by minors (less than 18).

**Can personal laws be overridden?**

- The SC ruled in **‘Shayara Bano v Union of India’** (2017) that the practice of instant triple talaq is unconstitutional, despite the fact that it is permitted under Muslim law.
- The Karnataka HC (2013) ruled that no Indian citizen on the ground of his belonging to a particular religion can claim immunity from the **Prohibition of Child Marriage Act**.

**The Prohibition of Child Marriage (Amendment) Bill, 2021:**

- It was introduced by the Union Minister for Women and Child Development to increase the age of marriage for women, and **ensure harmony in the age limit across religions**.
- During the Parliamentary debate, however, the Bill was criticised as unconstitutional since it **breaches Article 25 of the Constitution**, which provides freedom of conscience as well as free profession, practice, and propagation of religion.

**Conclusion:**

- Poverty, and lack of access to quality **health and education are larger issues** that must be addressed in order to address issues such as child marriage.
- As penal laws do not result in societal change, it will be the government’s duty to **make the shift acceptable as a social norm.**

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus:** **Functions and Responsibilities of the Union and the States, Issues and Challenges Pertaining to the Federal Structure, Devolution of Powers**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/centre-vs-delhi-govt-on-control-over-services-timeline-of-a-dispute-8380698/)

 **Direction:** The article highlights the protracted legal battle between the Centre and the Delhi government and SC’s verdicts on this dispute.

**Context:** A five-judge Constitution Bench of the SC is hearing the dispute between the Centre and the Delhi government over matters pertaining to control over the transfers and the overall functioning of administrative services in the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi.

Article 239AA:

- **Article 239 AA** was inserted in the Constitution by the **69th Amendment Act, 1991**, and conferred **Special Status upon Delhi** following the recommendations of the **S Balakrishnan Committee** (set up in 1987 to look into Delhi’s demands for statehood).
- According to this provision, the NCT of Delhi will have an **Administrator and a Legislative Assembly.**
- The Legislative Assembly shall have the power to make laws for the whole or any part of the NCT with respect to any matters in the State List or Concurrent List **except on the subjects of police, public order, and land.**

 **Timeline of the dispute** 

**The 2017 Delhi HC verdict:**

- For administration purposes of the NCT, the Lieutenant Governor (**LG) is not bound by the aid and advice** of the Council of Ministers in every matter.
- On appeal, the SC referred the matter to decide the interpretation of **Article 239AA** of the Constitution.

**The 2018 SC verdict:**

- A five-judge Bench laid down broad parameters for the governance of Delhi.
- The court **limited the LG’s jurisdiction to matters involving land, police, and public order**, stating that for all other matters, he must act with the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.

**The SC’s 2019 split verdict:**

- The verdict was essentially delivered **to decide the contentious issues based on the law settled by the five-judge Constitution Bench in 2018**.
- A two-judge Bench settled several issues relating to the powers of the LG, however, on the issue of **control over services, the two judges ruled differently**.
- In the case of a split verdict, the case is heard afresh by a larger Bench assigned by the CJI.

**The SC’s 3-judge Bench and the Centre’s argument to refer it to a larger Bench:**

- The Centre argued that because Delhi is the **national capital** and the “face of the nation,” it needed the authority to order transfers and postings of personnel there.
- The court agreed that the **scope of the legislative and executive powers** of the Centre and NCT of Delhi would need an authoritative pronouncement under **Article 145(3)** of the Constitution.
    - **Article 145(3):** The minimum number of Judges who must sit to decide any case involving a substantial question of law concerning the interpretation of the Constitution **shall be five.**
- The court noted that the primary contention is related to the interpretation of **Article 239 AA(3)(a)** of the Constitution, which deals with special provisions for the NCT of Delhi.
- Hence a three-judge Bench had referred this case (last year) to a larger Bench on the Centre’s plea for “**further examination**”.

### [Disaster risk reduction: CEA releases disaster management plan for power sector](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/14/disaster-risk-reduction-cea-releases-disaster-management-plan-for-power-sector/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus:** **Disaster and Disaster Management**

**Source:** [**BL**](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/cea-releases-disaster-management-plan-for-power-sector/article66361805.ece)

**Direction:** The article highlights the approach for disaster mitigation, preparedness, emergency response and recovery efforts in the power sector.

**Context:** The Central Electricity Authority (CEA) has released the **disaster management plan** (DMP) for the **power sector** in a bid to evolve a proactive and integrated approach to strengthen disaster mitigation, preparedness, emergency response and recovery efforts.

**Background:**

- **The Power Sector** is one of the most important infrastructures of the country, as the growth of this sector is **directly correlated with the economic growth** of the country.
- Any disruption in the power sector due to **disaster creates a hardship** for human beings, as every aspect of human life is **directly or indirectly associated with electricity.**
- The DMP comes as the Government is investigating instances of **land subsidence in the Uk’s Joshimath**, the gateway to pilgrimage sites, such as Badrinath and Hemkund Sahib.
- The DMP is also in conformity with the **10-point agenda** articulated by the PM at the Asian Ministerial Conference on disaster risk reduction in 2016. It includes –
    - **Investing in risk mapping globally.**
    - Creating a network of universities working on disaster-related issues.
    - Leveraging social media and mobile technologies for **disaster risk reduction** (DRR).
    - Building local capacities for disaster management, reduction and relief, etc.

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/disaster_.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/disaster_.png)

**Highlights of the DMP:**

- It provides **a framework and direction** to the utilities in the power sector for all phases of the disaster management cycle.
- **It is intended to guide** all agencies within the sector with a general concept of potential emergencies and roles and assignments before, during, and following emergency situations.
- To estimate threats to power infrastructure, it is pertinent that **fragility and vulnerability analysis is carried out for civil structures** like buildings and foundations in transmission and distribution facilities.

**Objectives of the DMP:**

- **To find out the quantitative risk** involved in power networks.
- To devise effective strategies for **prevention, mitigation, response, and recovery**.

**Significance of DMP:**

- Accurately assessing climate risks is difficult, hence, **electric utilities can manage risks by considering different climate scenarios and potential impacts** on their assets.
- This will **ensure a reliable power supply and quick restoration** even in times of extreme weather events and natural disasters.
- This will be helpful for **policy and decision-makers** to evaluate strategies and measures for **critical infrastructure** planning and protection.

**Way ahead suggested in the DMP:**

- Social media has become an important tool for disaster management since it may be used for **rescue, rehabilitation, and relief**.
- Hence, **the use of social media** on an organisational level can be conceived in two broad categories –

1. **Passively**, disseminate information and receive user feedback via incoming messages.
2. **Proactively,** as an emergency management tool, for –
    1. Conducting emergency **communications** and issuing warnings;
    2. **Monitoring** user activities and posts to establish situational awareness;
    3. Using uploaded images to create damage **estimates**, etc.

### [Corruption in Public Life](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/14/corruption-in-public-life/)

#### **GS Paper 4**

**Syllabus: Challenges of Corruption**

**Source:** [**Indian Express**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/the-story-of-de-la-rue-currency-printing-firm-at-centre-of-cbis-mayaram-case-8380691/)

**Context:** The CBI has registered an FIR against former **finance secretary Arvind Mayaram** for alleged cheating, criminal conspiracy, and corruption.

- Previously, **Jharkhand IAS officer Pooja Singhal** was suspended for misappropriation of funds in MGNREGA

**What is the case agains Mayaram?**

He is accused of **extending undue favours to the UK-based company De La Rue** by giving a three-year extension to its “expired contract” for the supply of exclusive colour shift security thread for **Indian currency notes** when he was finance secretary.

**What is Corruption?**

Corruption refers to **unethical behaviour, which is characterized by misuse of public or organizational power**, causing harm not only to organizations but also to society.

- The word corrupt is from the Latin word ‘corruptus’ meaning to **break or destroy**
- Corruption is an important **manifestation of the failure of ethics**
- Corruption misuse of **entrusted power for private gain**

 **[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/corruption.jpg?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/corruption.jpg)**

**The Wheel of corruption:**

In India, corruption, and abuse of office are aggravated by the following factors:

- **The colonial legacy of unchallenged authority**, the propensity to exercise power arbitrarily – easy to deviate from ethical conduct
- **Enormous asymmetry of power** – eco, social inequalities, caste legacy, 90% workforce in unorganized sector

**The issue with blood loss?**

Worldwide, uncontrolled haemorrhage is the leading cause of traumatic death during accidents or injuries among the military and civilian populations. Severe bleeding triggers trauma due to shock, hypothermia, coagulopathy, tissue damage, and organ failure that often causes mortality.

- The Hemo-halt bandage can **reduce blood loss before treatment**, save lives, and reduce disabilities on the battlefield. It can also contribute to the reduction in hospitalization costs.
