#### **GS Paper 1**

**Syllabus**: Geography

**Source:** [The Hindu](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/south-asian-black-carbon-aerosols-increase-glacial-mass-loss-over-tibetan-plateau/article66329434.ece)

 **Context**: A recent study has found that **Black carbon aerosols have indirectly affected the mass gain of the Tibetan Plateau glaciers** by changing **long-range water vapour transport from the South Asian monsoon region.**

- The South Asia region adjacent to the Tibetan Plateau **has among the highest levels of black carbon emission in the world.**

**About Black Carbon:**

- Black carbon is a **short-lived climate pollutant with a lifetime of only days to weeks after release in the atmosphere.**
- Black carbon is formed by the **incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, wood, and other fuels**

**Impact of Black Carbon on Cryosphere**

- **Rapid melting of Glaciers**
    - **Asian Brown Cloud (ABC)**: A man-made cloud of carbon emissions, dust, and other pollutants causes less sunlight, less rain, and an inverse warming effect, which causes glacier melting to accelerate.
- **Glacier retreat**: Gangotri glacier retreated 850 meters between 1996 and 1999; as a result of **black carbon deposits** due to **stubble burning** and **forest fires**
- **Increasing Glacial lakes**
- **Changes in Snow Albedo**
- **Livelihood impact**
- **Respiratory and cardiovascular** health impacts on **humans**

**Short-term and Long term impacts**

**Way Forward:**

- **Policies in place to reduce black carbon emissions** – Enhancing fuel-efficiency standards, phasing out diesel vehicles, promoting electric cars etc.
- **Aggressively curbing black carbon emissions**
- **New economically and technically feasible policies** can help to contain glacier melt.
- **Regional cooperation** to protect these resources will pay important dividends for the **health and well-being** of the people in the region.

### [Supreme Court upholds demonetisation: What was the challenge about?](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/03/supreme-court-upholds-demonetisation-what-was-the-challenge-about/)

#### **GS Paper 2**

**Syllabus:** **Government Policies and Interventions for Development in various sectors and Issues arising out of their Design and Implementation**

**Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/supreme-court-upholds-demonetisation-what-was-the-challenge-about-8356303/)

 **Direction:** The article highlights the background in which the issue of demonetisation reached the SC, arguments in favour and against demonetisation and the recent SC verdict.

**Context:** The Supreme Court upheld the government’s decision to demonetise currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 by a 4:1 majority.

**Background:**

- On November 8, 2016, the PM of India announced that the two notes would no more be legal tender, with immediate effect.
    - Introduced new notes of Rs 2,000 and Rs 500 for public circulation.
    - **Two primary reasons:** to curb fake currency notes and reduce black money stored as cash.
- Though supported by many, **58 petitions** have been filed in the SC challenging various aspects.
- The petitioners accused that **Section 26(2) of RBI Act, 1934**, was not followed: On the **recommendation of the [RBI] Central Board**, the Central Government may, by notification in the Gazette of India, declare that any series of bank notes of any denomination shall cease to be legal tender.
- The court was to consider whether the **recommendation for the policy came from the government or the RBI.**

**Arguments for and against demonetisation presented in the SC:**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Against (by petitioners)**|**For (by RBI and government)**|
|●        As per **Section 26(2)**, the recommendation should have emanated from the RBI.<br><br>●        In this case, the **government had advised the central bank**, following which it made the recommendation.<br><br>●        Earlier governments had demonetised currency (in 1946 and 1978), **by way of a law made by Parliament.**|●        The said Section **does not talk about the process of initiation.**<br><br>●        The **quorum** as determined by RBI General Regulations, 1949, was met for the Central Board meeting.<br><br>●        Though consultations with the RBI began in Feb 2016, the **process was kept confidential.**<br><br>●        The RBI had not agreed to the previous demonetisation decisions, but the earlier governments made the law.|

**The SC’s (4:1) verdict on demonetisation:**

[![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/judgment_1-1.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/judgment_1-1.png)

- The Centre’s notification was **valid and satisfied the test of proportionality** – a reasonable nexus between the objectives and the means to achieve the objectives.
- From the record, it appears that there was **a consultative process** between the central government and RBI for over 6 months before the decision was taken.
- The Decision-making process **cannot be faulted merely because the proposal emanated from the centre** (as the government and RBI are not in ‘isolated boxes’) and the court cannot replace the wisdom of the executive with its wisdom.
- The action taken by the Central Government has been validated by the **Specified Bank Notes (Cessation of liabilities) Act, 2017**, which prohibited and penalised the holding or transferring or receiving of demonetised currency.

**The dissenting judgement:**

- While the measure was “**well-intentioned**”, it was to be declared **unlawful purely on legal grounds** as the record demonstrates that there was **no independent application of mind** by RBI.
- Violation of Section 26(2), as the proposal for demonetisation, is **to emanate from the central board of the RBI** and the demonetisation has to be done **through legislation rather than through executive notification.**

**Conclusion:** Most policy decisions carry the risk of unintended consequences, which must be carefully balanced against the potential benefits of such decisions.

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus:** **Environment and Conservation**

**Source:** [**TH**](https://epaper.thehindu.com/reader)

**Direction:** The article discusses the new Forest (Conservation) Rules, 2022 and the apprehension of these rules being in violation of the Forest Rights Act, 2006.

**Context:** The conflict between the government and the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST) over the Forest (Conservation) Rules, 2022, seems to be escalating.

**Background:**

- The Union Environment Ministry notified the Forest (Conservation) Rules, 2022, under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, thus **replacing the Forest (Conservation) Rules, 2003**
- NCST had raised concerns about the provision in the new rules that **proposes to do away with the consent clause for the diversion of forest land for other purposes** and recommended putting these rules on hold.
- However, the government insisted that the rules were framed under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 and that the NCST’s apprehension of these rules being in violation of the Forest Rights Act, 2006, **is not legally admissible**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**The Forest (Conservation) Act (FCA), 1980**|**The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 or the Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006**|
|●        **It regulates deforestation** by prohibiting the felling of forests for any “non-forestry” purpose without prior approval from the central government.<br><br>●        **The clearance process** includes obtaining permission from local forest rights holders as well as wildlife authorities.<br><br>●        The Centre has the authority to deny such requests or to grant them with legally binding conditions.|●        It recognizes forest-dwelling tribal communities’ and other traditional forest dwellers’ **rights to forest resources** on which these communities rely for a variety of needs.<br><br>●        It imposes on the **Gram Sabha** and rights holders the responsibility of biodiversity conservation and protection, by preventing any destructive practices affecting these resources.<br><br>●        Under the Act, **the Gram Sabha is a highly empowered body** that allows the tribal population to have a decisive say in determining local policies and schemes that affect them.|

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**The Forest Conservation Rules, 2003**|**The Forest (Conservation) Rules, 2022**|
|●        There are two stages of approval (**‘In-Principle’ and ‘Final’,** after given conditions are met) prescribed for any application by any entity to use the forest land.<br><br>●        Nodal Officer —> Divisional Forest Officer and the District Collector —> Conservator of Forests —> State Administration —> MoEFCC<br><br>●        **The District Collector** shall complete the process of recognition and vesting of forest rights in accordance with the provisions of the FRA (**obtain the consent of each Gram Sabha**).|●        The Central Government can give its final approval and thereafter leave it to the state government to pass an order for de-reservation or diversion or assignment.<br><br>●        It is then left to the state government now to make sure that the claims of forest dwellers are settled.<br><br>●        **However, the collector is not required to obtain the consent of Gram Sabhas before the In-principle approval.**|

**Concern about the new Rules:** The Gram Sabha’s approval had significant persuasive power and could influence decisions to proceed with the diversion process. However, the new Rules eroded Gram Sabha’s role.

Consider the following statements:

1. As per a recent amendment to the Indian Forest Act, of 1927, forest dwellers have the right to fell the bamboo grown in forest areas.
2. As per the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, bamboo is a minor forest produce.
3. The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 allows ownership of minor forest produce to forest dwellers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

1. 1. 1. 1 and 2 only
        2. 2 and 3 only
        3. 3 only
        4. 1, 2 and 3

**Ans: 2**

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is not correct. Under the original Act, the definition of a tree includes palms, bamboo, stumps, brushwood, and canes.  The amendment act amends this definition of the tree to remove the word bamboo.

### [Crypto awareness campaign](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/03/crypto-awareness-campaign/)

#### **GS Paper 3**

**Syllabus**: Awareness in the fields of IT, Space, Computers, robotics, nano-technology, bio-technology and issues relating to intellectual property rights.

**Source:** [The Hindu](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/explained-what-is-the-crypto-awareness-campaign/article66324992.ece)

**Context**: The Investor Education and Protection Fund (IEPF) will launch an outreach programme soon to **create awareness of cryptocurrencies and online gaming.**

**About Investor Education and Protection Fund (IEPF)**

- It is managed by the **IEPF Authority**, which was set up in **2016 under the provisions of Section 125 of the Companies Act, of 2013**.
- It comes under the aegis of the **Ministry of Corporate Affairs**.
- The Authority is entrusted with the responsibility of **administration of the IEPF,** which, **besides promoting awareness among investors, makes refunds of shares, unclaimed dividends, matured deposits and debentures and so on to rightful claimants**.

**About Cryptocurrency:** A digital currency is one in which transactions are verified and records maintained by a decentralized system using cryptography, rather than by a centralized authority.

**Online gaming**

- The **Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has been appointed** the nodal industry for online gaming in India; **for e-sports,** the **nodal agency is the Department of Sports**, under the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports.
- A glance at the rulings of the Supreme Court and several High Courts clearly establishes **‘Games of Skill’ as legitimate business activities protected under Article 19(1)(g) of the Indian Constitution**. These rulings have also emphasized a clear distinction between ‘Games of Skill’ and ‘Games of Chance’.

**Issues with Online Gaming:**

- There is confusion about the **definitions of a ‘game of chance’ like fantasy games, and a ‘game of skill’,** a term, which has been used in the Public Gaming Act (1867) but has not been spelt out.
- There are **risks from cybercrimes** as well.
- Despite court rulings, online skill games have **faced restrictions in a few States due to addiction,** **financial losses and the thin line between skill and chance**.

**How Cryptocurrency creates regulatory hurdles:**

- **Cybersecurity threats**
- **Misuse of cryptocurrency** is hard to detect
- Controlling monetary policy like **inflation, growth would become an issue**
- The **anonymity of transactions** may lead to tax evasion
- **Geopolitical issues**: Countries may manipulate their cryptocurrency e.g. Experts say China’s eCNY will threaten dollar dominance and can be a tool for a currency war
- The high **volatility of cryptocurrency and the highly fragmented** market

**Measures taken to tackle this at the national level.**

- India recently decided to **tax cryptocurrencies, a 30%** on the transfer of such assets as well as a **1%TDS on every transaction.**
- RBI exploring **DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology**) based **Central Bank Digital Currency.**
- In July 2022, The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recommended a ban on cryptocurrencies citing **‘destabilizing effects on the country’s monetary and fiscal health’.**

**Source:** [**Indian Express**](https://indianexpress.com/article/education/in-6-years-special-loans-for-higher-education-at-1-3rd-of-target-8355594/)

**Context:** HEFA has fallen short of the government’s target of **mobilizing Rs 1 Lakh** crore by 2022

**Reasons for the shortfall:**

- **The reluctance of the institute to take loans due to weak internal source of finances:** IIT Bombay administration had to clarify it was forced to resort to a fee hike – which triggered student protests – to repay HEFA loans
- **Fund crunch** during Covid19 time
- **Revision in the funding pattern** in 2020

**About HEFA:**

- HEFA was set up by the **Centre in 2017** to upgrade the education infrastructure in the higher education institutions under the Government of India.
    - It has sanctioned **144 loans worth Rs 35,000** crore so far, falling short of the government’s target of mobilising Rs 1 lakh crore by 2022
- HEFA, which was set up as a **non-profit Non-Banking Financing Company** (NBFC), is a joint venture between the **Union Ministry of Education and the Canara Bank** to finance infrastructure development in educational institutions through long-term loans.
    - While the premium is paid by the **institute**, **interest** is paid by the government.
- The **government expanded the scope of HEFA** in 2018 under the **Revitalizing Infrastructure and Systems in Education or RISE by 2022 initiative**, bringing **schools and medical colleges** under its ambit, and making it the nodal body in infrastructure financing in the education sector.
