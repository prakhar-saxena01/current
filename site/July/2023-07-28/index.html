<h4 id="gs-paper-2"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Important Aspects of Governance, Transparency and Accountability</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/jan-vishwas-amendment-bill-2023-monsoon-session-parliament-bill-explains/article67095334.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Jan Vishwas (Amendment of Provisions) Bill 2023 is set to be taken up during the ongoing Monsoon Session of the Parliament.</p>
<p><strong>Objective of the Bill:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To redefine the regulatory landscape of the country with decriminalisation of minor offences under 42 Acts.</li>
<li>To reduce compliance burden and promote ease of living and doing business in the country.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>More about the Bill:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Bill was tabled in Parliament by the Union Ministry of Commerce and Industry (December 2022) and then referred to a Joint Parliamentary Committee.</li>
<li>As per reports, most recommendations of the JPC have been approved by the Union Cabinet, clearing the way for its passing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Salient provisions of the Bill:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decriminalising:</strong> 180 offences across 42 laws governing environment, agriculture, media, industry and trade, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Completely remove/ replace imprisonment clauses:</strong> With monetary fines.</li>
<li>Compounding of offences in some provisions.</li>
<li>Removes all offences and penalties under the Indian Post Office Act, 1898.</li>
<li><strong>Changes in grievance redressal mechanisms</strong>: Appointment of one or more Adjudicating Officers for determining penalties.</li>
<li><strong>A periodic revision of fines and penalties:</strong> An increase of 10% of the minimum amount every 3 years for various offences in the specified Acts.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Some key laws covered in the Bill:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981</li>
<li>The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986</li>
<li>The Indian Forest Act, 1927</li>
<li>The Agricultural Produce (Grading &amp; Marking) Act, 1937</li>
<li>The Information Technology Act, 2000</li>
<li>The Copyright Act, 1957</li>
<li>The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988</li>
<li>The Cinematograph Act, 1952</li>
<li>The Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, etc</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Need for the Bill:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A large number of compliances govern doing business in India:</strong><ul>
<li>Currently, there are 1,536 laws which translate into around <strong>70,000 compliances</strong> that govern doing business in India.</li>
<li>Among these, <strong>26,134 have imprisonment clauses</strong> as a penalty for non-compliance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Lengthy processing times for the needed approvals:</strong> Escalating costs and dampening the entrepreneurial spirit.</li>
<li><strong>Implications:</strong><ul>
<li>Excessive compliances have proved burdensome for business enterprises, especially <strong>MSMEs</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Creating barriers</strong> to the smooth flow of ideas and the creation of jobs, wealth and GDP.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance of the Bill:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reducing the compliance burden gives <strong>impetus to the business ecosystem and improves the well-being of the public.</strong></li>
<li>Smoother processes will attract more investment.</li>
<li><strong>It will reduce judicial burden,</strong> as settlement by compounding method, adjudication and administrative mechanism will save time, energy and resources.</li>
<li>In short, the Bill seeks to bolster <strong>‘trust-based governance’</strong> – promoting ease of doing business and ease of living.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Concerns:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quasi-decriminalisation:</strong> The monetary fines or penalties are not a good enough attempt at decriminalisation.</li>
<li><strong>Remove the deterrence effect of the environmental legislation:</strong> The blanket removal of imprisonment provision might remove deterrence, especially for large corporations profiteering from the offence.</li>
<li><strong>Adjudicating Officers may lack the technical competence:</strong> Necessary to decide all penalties under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1981 and the Environment (Protection) Act 1986.</li>
<li><strong>Many offences</strong> (like theft or misappropriation of postal articles) proposed to be removed have nothing to do with its objective of decriminalisation to promote ease of doing business<strong>.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The cornerstone of <strong>democratic governance</strong> lies in the government trusting its own people and institutions and <strong>a web of outdated rules and regulations causes trust deficit</strong>.</li>
<li>After resolving the above issues, <strong>the Jan Vishwas Bill will help to clear the burdensome collection of old and outdated legislation.</strong></li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Rajya Sabha passed the Cinematograph (Amendment) Bill 2023, which cracks down on film piracy along with changing how movies are certified by the censor board.</p>
<p><strong>The background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Cinematograph (Amendment) Bill 2019</strong> was introduced in the Rajya Sabha proposing changes <strong>related only to film piracy</strong>.</li>
<li>This Bill was referred to the Standing Committee on Information Technology, whose recommendations included <strong>age-based categories of certification.</strong></li>
<li>The revised Cinematograph (Amendment) Bill 2021 and the final version (2023 Bill) were drafted after consultations with industry stakeholders and the public.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About the 2023 Bill:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Introduced by the Ministry of I&amp;B, the Bill seeks to amend <strong>the Cinematograph Act 1952.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The 1952 Act authorises the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC)</strong> to require cuts in films and clear them for exhibition in cinemas and on television/ refuse the exhibition of a film.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why does the Cinematograph Act 1952 need amendments?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To harmonise the law</strong> with various executive orders, SC judgements, and other legislations like the Copyright Act, 1957 and the IT Act (IT) 2000.</li>
<li><strong>To improve the procedure</strong> for licensing films for public exhibition by the CBFC, and</li>
<li><strong>To expand the scope</strong> of categorisations for certification.</li>
<li><strong>To curb the menace of piracy,</strong> there was a huge demand from the film industry to address the issue of unauthorised recording and exhibition of films, which is causing them huge losses (Rs 20,000 crore annually).</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Concerns:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>OTT platforms out of the purview of the Bill:</strong> What if an uncut movie is broadcast on OTT?</li>
<li><strong>Age-appropriate categories are self-regulatory:</strong> It places the onus on parents and guardians to determine if the material is appropriate for viewers of a particular age range.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Offshore Areas Mineral (Development and Regulation) Amendment Bill 2023 to amend the offshore areas mineral law was introduced in Lok Sabha.</p>
<p><strong>About the bill:</strong></p>
<p>The bill, prepared by the <strong>Ministry of Mines</strong>, seeks to amend the Offshore Areas Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act <strong>2002</strong>, to allow auction of minerals mined offshore.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose behind amending the 2002 Act:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To mine rocks under the sea:</strong> Under the original Act, not even a single rock could be not mined out from the sea bed mainly due to pending litigations.<ul>
<li>Hence, the Bill allows the use of the national wealth in the sea for the use of the people of the country.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>To provide an auction of minerals mined offshore:</strong> The original Act does not allow the auction of such minerals.</li>
<li><strong>To facilitate private sector participation:</strong> In the mining of non-atomic minerals in India’s territorial waters and continental shelf.<ul>
<li>Meanwhile, the bill includes a provision to grant mineral concession without competitive bidding to Government companies or corporations.</li>
<li>However, private companies might be encouraged <strong>to contribute cutting-edge technologies for the execution of complex mining operations</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>To improve transparency in the allocation of mineral resources</strong>: With a provision for granting production leases only through auction, Mint reported.</li>
<li><strong>To grant an exploration licence or production lease:</strong> Only to a government company in case the quality of minerals in that particular area is equal to or above the threshold value decided by the Centre.</li>
<li><strong>To propose area under a production lease:</strong> Such areas shall comprise contiguous standard blocks and shall not exceed an area of 15 minutes latitude by 15 minutes longitude.</li>
<li><strong>To promote ease of doing business</strong>: A provision has been made for easy transfer of exploration licence, composite licence or production lease.</li>
<li><strong>To remove discretion in the grant of renewals</strong>: The provisions for renewal of production leases have been removed and the period of production lease has been increased to 50 years.</li>
<li><strong>To grant powers to the central government:</strong> To revise the order made by the Administering Authority, issue directions and call for information from the Administering Authority, in the public interest.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What India gains from this Bill?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As India aims to become a high-growth economy, it needs to harness its maritime resources to its optimal capacity.</li>
<li>The bill encourages the participation of the <strong>public-private sector.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The private sector</strong> will bring the necessary expertise and technology to explore and mine the mineral resources present in the EEZ.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Jharkhand government has released draft rules for public consultation to implement <strong>The Provisions of the</strong> [<strong>Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act (PESA) enacted in 1996</strong>.](https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/functions-and-responsibilities-of-the-union-and-the-states-issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure-devolution-of-powers-and-finances-up-to-local-levels-and-challenges-therein/devolution-of-powers-and-finances-up-to-local-levels-and-challenges-therein/73rd-amendment-act-panchayati-raj/pesa-act-1996/#:~:text=Panchayats%20(Extension%20to%20Scheduled%20Areas,Scheduled%20Areas%20of%20the%20country.)</p>

<li>The PESA Act was enacted in 1996 <strong>“to provide for the extension of the provisions of Part IX of the Constitution relating to the Panchayats to the Scheduled Areas”.</strong></li>
<li>Part IX, <strong>comprising Articles 243-243ZT of the Constitution</strong>, contains provisions relating to municipalities and cooperative societies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under the Act, Scheduled Areas are those <strong>referred to in Article 244(1),</strong> which says that the provisions of the Fifth Schedule shall apply to the <strong>Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes in states other than Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.</strong></p>
<p>The Fifth Schedule provides for <strong>a range of special provisions for these areas.</strong></p>
<p>Ten states — Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Rajasthan, and Telangana — <strong>have notified Fifth Schedule areas that cover (partially or fully) several districts in each of these states.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong></p>
<p>Self-governance recognises the right of tribal communities and empowers Gram Sabha.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the <strong>international exhibition-cum-convention Centre (IECC) complex</strong> named <strong>Bharat Mandapam</strong> at Pragati Maidan in New Delhi.</p>
<ul>
<li>The IECC complex is India’s largest <strong>MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences, and exhibitions) destination</strong> and features <strong>state-of-the-art facilities</strong>, including a <strong>convention centre, exhibition halls, and an amphitheatre.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>architectural design of the convention centre incorporates elements from India’s traditional art and culture</strong>, representing the <strong>nation’s rich heritage and modern achievements</strong>.</p>
<p>The term <strong>‘Bharat Mandapam’ is derived from</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/24/basavanna-2/"><strong>Lord Basaveshwara’s</strong></a> <strong>concept of ‘Anubhav Mantapa,’</strong> which was a significant institution in the 12th century. Anubhav Mantapa is considered one of the <strong>earliest parliaments in human history</strong>, where poets and socio-spiritual reformers known as <strong>Sharanas</strong> discussed and deliberated on various reforms.</p>
<p><strong>In this historical context:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prabhudeva</strong>, a renowned Yogi, served as the President, while Lord Basaveshwara acted as the Prime Minister.</li>
<li>The members of the Anubhav Mantapa were <strong>not elected by the people</strong>; instead, they were chosen or nominated by the higher authorities of the Mantapa.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas stated that India’s decision to restrict exports of certain types of rice could contribute to food price inflation and should be reversed.</p>
<p>Previously, <strong>India has implemented</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/08/agricultural-exports-imports/"><strong>restrictions on non-basmati white rice exports</strong></a> to ensure <strong>sufficient availability in the domestic market</strong> at reasonable prices. The export ban is also intended to support the <strong>ethanol-blending program</strong>, reduce costly oil imports, and benefit the animal husbandry and poultry sectors by <strong>lowering animal feed costs</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>India’s status in rice exports:</strong></p>
<p>India is the <strong>second-largest producer of rice</strong> in the world, after China. India has become the <strong>largest rice exporter globally,</strong> accounting for <strong>nearly 40% of global rice exports in 2022/23</strong>. Non-basmati white rice constitutes <strong>approximately 25% of</strong> the total rice exported from the country.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of the ban</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>IMF predicts a potential <strong>rise of 10-15% this year</strong> in international rice prices.</li>
<li><strong>Countries in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa,</strong> which heavily rely on India as a major supplier of rice, may face vulnerability due to potential disruptions in the rice market.</li>
