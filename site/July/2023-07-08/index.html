<h4 id="gs-paper-2"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Structure, Organization and Functioning of the Executive and the Judiciary</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/due-process-clause-or-basic-structure-doctrine/article67054681.ece#:~:text=It%20is%20the%20due%20process,Unlawful%20Activities%20(Prevention)%20Act."><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Supreme Court of India provided two safety devices for the natural rights of the citizenry – namely, the <strong>due process clause and the basic structure doctrine</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The due process of law:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Taken from:</strong> The due process clause is an <strong>American</strong></li>
<li><strong>Based on natural laws:</strong> The term ‘law’ in the due process clause stands for natural law. Natural law, as higher law, renders state-made laws invalid when the state-made laws are contrary to natural law.</li>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law. Due process has two aspects –<ul>
<li><strong>Substantive due process:</strong> It anticipates that the substantive/ fundamental provisions of any legislation should be rational and not arbitrary in nature, and</li>
<li><strong>Procedural due process:</strong> It refers to the general procedures that must be followed before a person’s life, liberty, or property can be taken from him.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The debate in the Constituent Assembly of India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The leading members of the Assembly agreed on the idea that the <strong>due process clause must be incorporated into the Constitution.</strong></li>
<li><strong>However, the prominent opposers</strong> (like GB Pant) of the clause believed that the clause would be a <strong>hurdle in the implementation of social reform laws</strong> such as the abolition of the zamindari system.</li>
<li>The drafting committee dropped the due process clause from the draft and replaced it with ‘<strong>except according to procedure established by law</strong>’ – a term borrowed from the <strong>Japanese</strong> Constitution of 1946.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The resurrection of due process: In Maneka Gandhi vs Union of India (1978)</strong>, the SC held that when ‘personal liberty’ under Article 21 was affected by any law, courts would seriously interrogate and probe the <strong>purpose, rationale, and legitimacy of the law</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Significance of the judgement:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Court has not used ‘due process’ to invalidate social welfare legislation (which the Constitution makers fear).</li>
<li>In fact, the Court has used due process doctrines <strong>to protect the interests of vulnerable sections of society</strong> such as pavement dwellers and prisoners.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The basic structure doctrine:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It is a judicial creation</strong> enunciated by the SC in the <strong>Kesavananda Bharati case (1973)</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>A 13-judge Constitution Bench</strong> of the SC (with a 7-6 majority) redefined the relationship between Parliament and the Constitution by ruling that the “<strong>basic structure</strong>” of the Constitution is inviolable, and cannot be amended by Parliament.</li>
<li>While the Parliament had vast powers to amend the Constitution, <strong>certain parts</strong> (“basic structure”) <strong>are so inherent and intrinsic to the Constitution</strong> that even Parliament cannot touch it.</li>
<li>While parliamentary democracy, fundamental rights, judicial review, and secularism are all held by courts as basic structures, <strong>the list is not exhaustive</strong> (decided by the court on a case-by-case basis).</li>
<li>The basic structure doctrine (origins are found in the German Constitution) has <strong>formed the bedrock of judicial review</strong> of all laws passed by the Indian Parliament.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Comparing the two doctrines:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike the basic structure doctrine, the due process clause was <strong>duly discussed</strong> by the Constituent Assembly.</li>
<li>The due process clause <strong>has a splendid place in the constitutional history</strong> of the world.</li>
<li>It is the due process clause, not the basic structure doctrine, <strong>that offers a surer guarantee for the citizen’s natural rights</strong>.</li>
<li>Hence, the due process clause <strong>must be firmly embedded</strong> in the constitutional architecture of India and incorporated into the constitutional text.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> As the basic structure doctrine highlighted in the Kesavanada Bharati case has touched 50 years, its efficacy to protect the natural rights of the citizen in relation to the due process clause is worth examining.</p>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/data-protection-bill-approved-by-cabinet-content-concerns-8780035/#:~:text=The%20Bill%20is%20learnt%20to,public%20order%20among%20other%20things."><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Union Cabinet cleared the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Bill.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/journey.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/journey.png" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>With the Union Cabinet’s approval, <strong>the Centre has made a 2nd attempt at framing legislation for the protection of data.</strong></li>
<li>The Bill is expected to be tabled in <strong>Parliament’s Monsoon Session</strong> that begins on July 20.</li>
<li>The Bill, once it becomes law, will play <strong>a crucial role in India’s trade negotiations with other nations</strong>, especially regions like the EU, whose General Data Protection Rules (GDPR) are among the world’s most exhaustive privacy laws.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Digital Personal Data Protection Bill:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/decodoing.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/decodoing.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It will apply to the processing of digital personal data</strong> within and outside (if it is done for offering goods or services or for profiling individuals) India.</li>
<li><strong>It requires entities that collect personal data</strong>/ <strong>data fiduciaries</strong> to maintain the accuracy of data, keep data secure, and delete data once their purpose has been met.</li>
<li><strong>It is expected to allow “voluntary undertaking”</strong>, which means that organisations who violate its rules can bring it up to the <strong>data protection board</strong> – an adjudicatory body that will deal with privacy-related grievances and disputes.<ul>
<li><strong>The board may decide to stop legal action</strong> against the organisation by accepting settlement payments.</li>
<li>Higher financial penalties may be imposed for similar offences committed repeatedly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The highest penalty</strong> – to be levied for failing to prevent a data breach – has been prescribed at Rs 250 crore <strong>per instance</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What changes are likely from the original version (proposed in Nov 2022)?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cross-border data flows to international jurisdictions:</strong> Moving from a ‘whitelisting’ (where personal data of Indian citizens can be transferred) approach to a ‘blacklisting’ mechanism.</li>
<li><strong>A provision on “deemed consent” could be made stricter for private entities</strong>, while allowing government departments to assume consent while processing personal data on grounds of national security and public interest.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the significance of privacy law?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Considering the dramatic expansion of the digital economy</strong> in the country, bringing in a robust data protection architecture is of critical importance.</li>
<li><strong>The Bill is a crucial pillar of the overarching framework of technology regulations</strong>, which also includes the Digital India Bill, the draft Indian Telecommunication Bill 2022, and a policy for non-personal data governance.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are the concerns around the draft Bill?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Largely retained the contents of the original version</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Wide-ranging exemptions</strong> for the central government and its agencies, were among the most criticised provisions of the previous draft.</li>
<li><strong>The central government can exempt</strong> “any instrumentality of the state” from adhering to the provisions on account of <strong>national security, relations with foreign governments, maintenance of public order</strong>, etc.</li>
<li><strong>The control of the central government</strong> in appointing members of the data protection board and <strong>determining the terms and conditions of their service</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>The definition of “per instance” is subjective</strong> and is open to interpretation by the data protection board on a case-by-case basis.</li>
<li><strong>The law could dilute the Right to Information (RTI) Act</strong>, as the personal data of government functionaries is likely to be protected under it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Comparing India’s proposal with other countries:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>According to the UNCTAD, <strong>137 out of 194 countries</strong> have put in place legislation to secure the protection of data and privacy.</li>
<li><strong>Africa and Asia</strong> show 61% (33 countries out of 54) and 57% (34 countries out of 60) adoption respectively.</li>
<li><strong>Only 48% of Least Developed Countries</strong> (22 out of 46) have data protection and privacy laws.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> This Bill needs to go through a process of extensive discussion in Parliament. The provisions need to be tightened, ambiguities removed, and discretion minimised.</p>

<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Effects of Liberalization on the Economy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/choose-a-new-palette-for-indias-creative-economy/article67046426.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The creative economy is one of the youngest and fastest-growing sectors, with unique challenges that often go unnoticed by public and private investors.</p>
<p><strong>What is the creative economy?</strong></p>
<p>The creative economy refers to <strong>the intersection of culture, creativity, and commerce. It encompasses economic activities</strong> that are based on creative and cultural products and services, such as arts, design, media, entertainment, and technology.</p>
<ul>
<li>The creative industries include <strong>advertising, architecture, arts and crafts, design, fashion, film, video, photography, music</strong>, performing arts, publishing, etc.</li>
<li>They are also considered an important source of <strong>commercial and cultural value.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Digital platforms and technology</strong> have enabled Indian artists and artisans to reach wider audiences.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>India’s creative economy:</strong> It is estimated to contribute ~<strong>8% of the country’s employment</strong>, much higher than the corresponding share in Turkey (1%), Mexico (1.5%), Australia (2.1%), etc.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages for the Indian economy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pay reasonably well</strong> – 88% higher than the non-creative ones.</li>
<li>Contribute ~20% to the nation’s overall GVA.</li>
<li>Can help <strong>encourage India’s soft power</strong> by creating an ecosystem of innovative technology-based start-ups.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Economic sustainability</strong>, market access, digital divide and the preservation of traditional art forms in a rapidly changing society.</li>
<li><strong>Crime in the art world</strong> includes art theft, copyright infringement, forgery, fraud, and illicit trafficking.</li>
<li>India’s creative <strong>exports</strong> ($121 billion in 2019, out of which services accounted for almost $100 billion) <strong>are only one-tenth</strong> of those of the People’s Republic of China.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MONDIACULT 2022:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recognising the economic importance of culture</strong>, the UNESCO World Conference on Cultural Policies and Sustainable Development (MONDIACULT 2022) was held.</li>
<li>The goal was to share <strong>a vision for the future of cultural policies</strong> and to reaffirm the international community’s commitment to <strong>leveraging culture’s transformative power for sustainable development.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Government initiatives</strong> to provide financial assistance, training programmes, and opportunities for artists to exhibit their work.</li>
<li><strong>A collaborative model promoting cultural economy</strong> and providing guidance, technical support, infrastructure, access to investors, and networking opportunities.</li>
<li><strong>Promote contemporary artists as brands</strong> and ensure equal representation and financial assistance.</li>
<li><strong>Increased security measures, international cooperation</strong>, public awareness, and advanced technology for authentication and tracking.</li>
<li><strong>Regular audits of acquired artworks</strong> can enhance trust and preserve a collection’s integrity.</li>
<li><strong>Leveraging the latest ICT tools to enhance</strong> their participation in the business ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Seeing the economic and cultural significance of the creative economy in India, <strong>a facilitation mechanism</strong> should support the growth and development of the sector.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has launched the <strong>“Bharat Internet Utsav”</strong> to celebrate the power of the Internet.</p>
<p>It aims to highlight the <strong>transformative role of the internet by encouraging citizens</strong> to share their stories of how the internet has <strong>positively impacted their lives</strong>.

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-destroys-last-of-its-declared-chemical-weapons-closing-a-deadly-chapter-dating-to-world-war-i/article67055340.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p>Context: The United States has completed the <strong>destruction of its declared chemical weapons stockpile (</strong>rockets filled with GB nerve agent<strong>),</strong> marking a significant milestone in the history of warfare dating back to World War I.</p>
<p><strong>The deadline:</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. faced a Sept. 30 deadline to eliminate its remaining chemical weapons under the International <strong>Chemical Weapons Convention</strong>, which took effect in 1997 and was joined by 193 countries.</p>
<p><strong>Significance</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The destruction of the stockpile is seen as a <strong>defining moment for arms control efforts globally</strong> and sets an example for other countries to follow.</li>
<li>This achievement fulfils the <strong>US commitment under the International Chemical Weapons Convention</strong> and sends a message that such weapons are <strong>no longer acceptable</strong> on the battlefield.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About the Convention:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Chemical Weapons Convention</strong> is a multilateral treaty banning chemical weapons and requiring their destruction within the stipulated time. It makes it mandatory to destroy old and abandoned chemical weapons.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>India signed</strong> the treaty in January 1993.</li>
<li><strong>Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW)</strong> was formed (in 1997) under the Convention. It implements and enforces the terms of the CWC. It reports to the UN. It was awarded Nobel Peace Prize in 2013</li>
</ul>
<p>India passed <strong>Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000</strong> to implement the CWC.</p>
<p>It provided for the establishment of a <strong>National Authority for Chemical Weapons Convention or NACWC (</strong>formed in 2005), as a chief liaison between the government of India and the OPCW.</p>
<p><strong>About GB nerve agent:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sarin (military designation GB) is</strong> a nerve agent (chemicals that affect the nervous system) that is one of the most toxic of the known chemical warfare agents. It is generally odourless and tasteless. Exposure to sarin can cause death in minutes. Other examples of nerve agents are: soman (GD), tabun (GA), Mustard agent and VX</p>
<p><strong>About Chemical Weapons:</strong></p>
<p>Chemical weapons were first used in modern warfare in World War I, where they were estimated to have killed at least 100,000. Despite their use being subsequently banned by the Geneva Convention, countries continued to stockpile the weapons until the treaty called for their destruction. Besides US stocks, some parties to the convention, particularly Russia and Syria, still possess <strong>undeclared chemical weapons stockpiles</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> LIGO-India, <strong>a new gravitational-wave observatory</strong>, is set to put India on the research map and contribute to our understanding of the Universe.</p>
<ul>
<li>Currently, there are two LIGO setups in the US, and a third one will be built in the <strong>Hingoli district of Maharashtra, India.</strong> The facility’s construction is expected to be completed by 2030.</li>
</ul>
<p>LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory) is a physics experiment designed to <strong>detect gravitational waves</strong>, which are ripples in the fabric of spacetime caused by massive objects in accelerated motion.</p>
<p><strong>What are Gravitational Waves?</strong></p>
<p>Gravitational waves are ripples in the <strong>fabric of space and time</strong> that travel at the speed of light. They are created by the <strong>motion of massive objects</strong>, such as black holes or neutron stars, which generate gravitational waves when they orbit or collide with each other.</p>
<p>According to <strong>Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativity</strong>, any object with mass warps the space-time around it. When two massive objects orbit each other or collide, they produce ripples or waves in space-time that propagate outward at the speed of light.</p>
<p>Gravitational waves are <strong>extremely weak and difficult to detect</strong>. They were first directly detected by <strong>the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (</strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/01/09/laser-interferometer-gravitational-wave-observatory-ligo-project/"><strong>LIGO</strong></a><strong>) in 2015, a century after they were predicted by Einstein’s theory</strong>.</p>

<p>Recently, NGT highlighted the <strong>failure of the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority</strong> to follow environmental rules for <strong>construction on Khazan land</strong> at Cavelossim.</p>
<p><strong>Khazans are coastal wetlands of Goa</strong>. They were reclaimed from mangrove forests (in the pre-Christian Era) by an intricate system of dykes, sluice gates and canals and put to multiple productive uses such as agriculture, aquaculture and salt panning. <strong>They are low-lying, saline water-logged areas.</strong></p>

<p>After more than a century of curiosity, scientists have finally unravelled the mystery behind <strong>Antarctica’s Blood Falls, a bright red waterfall that flows from Taylor Glacier</strong>. The iconic red hue is caused by the <strong>presence of small “iron-rich nanospheres</strong>” (various elements such as iron, silicon, calcium, aluminium, and sodium) in the water.</p>
<p><strong>The Taylor Glacier is an Antarctic glacier</strong> about 54 kilometres long, flowing from the plateau of Victoria Land into the western end of Taylor Valley, north of the Kukri Hills, south of the Asgard Range.</p>

<p>India is set to establish its <strong>first Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) campus</strong> outside the country in Zanzibar, Tanzania. This move aligns with <strong>India’s National Education Policy 2020</strong> and aims to enhance educational cooperation between the two nations.</p>
<p><strong>Zanzibar is a Tanzanian archipelago</strong> off the coast of East Africa. It is Stone Town, a historic trade centre with Swahili and Islamic influences.</p>
<p><strong>Tanzania</strong> is an East African country known for its vast wilderness areas. They include the plains of Serengeti National Park, populated by the “big five” game (elephant, lion, leopard, buffalo, rhino), and Kilimanjaro National Park, home to Africa’s highest mountain.</p>
