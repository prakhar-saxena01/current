<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While global hunger numbers have stalled between 2021 and 2022, there are <strong>many places in the world facing deepening food crises.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Largely women and residents of rural areas</strong> did not have consistent access to nutritious, safe, and sufficient food in 2022.</li>
<li>Child malnutrition is still alarmingly high.</li>
<li><strong>By 2050, it’s projected that 70% of the global population will reside in cities</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This significant demographic shift necessitates a <strong>reorientation of food systems</strong> to cater to these new urban populations and eradicate hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition.</li>
<li><strong>The policy can strengthen intensification and increase productivity in farming</strong> close to small and intermediate cities and towns (SICTs).</li>
<li><strong>This will improve connectivity</strong> between farms and input and output markets, thus reducing the cost of access to markets and fostering farmers’ access to and use of modern inputs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A case study from India – The Role of urban proximity in agricultural intensification:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bangalore</strong> and its surroundings provide evidence of the essential role of SICTs in increasing the use of modern agricultural inputs in rural areas.</li>
<li>Farmers located farther from Bangalore show a higher use of modern inputs due to the influence of the town of <strong>Doddaballapura</strong> – a City in Bangalore’s Rural district.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The agrifood systems governance mechanisms and institutions must bridge sectoral and administrative borders and rely on subnational and local governments in order to implement these solutions.</p>
<p><strong>About the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It is an annual flagship report</strong> jointly prepared by the –<ul>
<li>Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO),</li>
<li>International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD),</li>
<li>United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF),</li>
<li>World Food Programme (WFP) and</li>
<li>World Health Organisation (WHO)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>It aims to inform on progress towards ending hunger,</strong> achieving food security and improving nutrition and to provide an in-depth analysis of key challenges for achieving this goal in the context of the SDG.</li>
<li>The report targets a wide audience, including <strong>policy-makers, international organisations, academic institutions and the general public</strong>.</li>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: Indian PM will be the <strong>Guest of Honour at France’s Bastille Day parade in Paris</strong>. The visit coincides with <strong>25 years of strategic partnerships with France.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Significance of the PM’s visit to France:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increasing investment:</strong> The visit will help diversify France and European economic ties away from China</li>
<li><strong>Boosting regional security:</strong> The visit will help boost India’s comprehensive national power and help India stabilise the balance of power in Asia</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Current analysis of India-France relations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Characteristics</strong>: The relationship between the two countries is characterized by strategic autonomy, independent foreign policies, and a shared vision of a multipolar world.</li>
<li><strong>Security objectives prominent</strong>: Unlike Indo-German relations, which are focused on trade, India and France prioritize security objectives.<ul>
<li>France has helped <strong>India diversify its pool of arms suppliers beyond Russia and the US</strong>, especially when sanctions were imposed on India in the past.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Balancing China:</strong> The relationship aims to <strong>balance China’s influence</strong> in the Indian Ocean and have a shared concern about Chinese expansionism.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-dimensional</strong>: The partnership between India and France has seen advancements through joint strategic visions, logistic support agreements, and military exercises in recent times</li>

<p><strong>Challenges in the relationship:</strong></p>
<p>India and France <strong>don’t have Free Trade Agreement</strong>, which limits the potential for increased trade and economic cooperation. Also, there is a <strong>trade imbalance in favour of France</strong> (France exporting more to India). Also, France has many times expressed concern on India’s stance at WTO, Climate summit and on <strong>India’s protection of intellectual property rights</strong></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>While military cooperation remains important, the Indo-French relationship could expand beyond arms sales. Initiatives like the International Solar Alliance and <strong>exploring minilateral and multilateral cooperation in the Indo-Pacific</strong> could bring additional dimensions to their partnership.</p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-3"><strong>GS Paper 3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Issues related to the Indian economy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/28-per-cent-tax-online-gaming-gst-council-8830353/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council, in its 50th meeting, decided to levy a uniform 28% tax on full face value for online gaming, casinos and horse racing.</p>
<p><strong>Decision to levy 28% uniform tax on online gaming:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Earlier, the ministerial panel had discussed the option of levying tax on gross gaming revenue or platform fee – the charge paid to avail the gaming services, <strong>but this did not find favour.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The uniform levy of 28% tax will be applicable on –</strong><ul>
<li><strong>The face value</strong> of the chips purchased in the case of casinos,</li>
<li>The full value of the bets placed with the bookmaker/totalisator in the case of horse racing, and</li>
<li>The full value of the bets placed in the case of online gaming.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The government will bring in amendments to the GST-related laws</strong> to include online gaming and horse racing as taxable actionable claims – goods under the CGST Act, 2017.</li>
<li>So far, lottery, betting, and gambling were classified as actionable claims.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How will the tax work in real life?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>At present, <strong>most gaming companies were paying a tax of 18%</strong> applicable on the platform fees.<ul>
<li><strong>Let’s assume that the platform fee is 10%.</strong> So, for every Rs 100 deposited in the game, the platform makes Rs 10 and 18% GST on Rs 10 means that effectively, on every Rs 100, the GST is Rs 1.8.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Under the new structure</strong>, a GST of 28% will be applicable on the entire face value of the bet or the consideration paid, and not the platform fee.<ul>
<li>Meaning that for every Rs 100 deposited, the GST on it will be Rs 28 – <strong>an increase of around 15.6 times.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How big is the online gaming market in India?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The industry grew at a <strong>CAGR of 38% between 2017-2020</strong>, as opposed to 8% in China and 10% in the US.</li>
<li>It is expected to grow at a <strong>CAGR of 15% to reach Rs 153 billion in revenue by 2024</strong>.</li>
<li>India’s percentage of <strong>new paying users (NPUs)</strong> in gaming has been the fastest-growing in the world.</li>
<li><strong>Transaction-based games’</strong> revenues grew 26% in India, with the number of paying gamers increasing by 17% from <strong>80 million in 2020 to 95 million in 2021.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Who gets impacted?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Online gaming is perhaps the only segment of the internet economy that has multiple highly profitable companies.<ul>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> Dream11 had a net profit of Rs 143 cr on revenues of Rs 3,841 crore in FY22.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The decision has been <strong>applied indiscriminately</strong> to gaming and gambling platforms.<ul>
<li>This includes companies that have spent years in <strong>lobbying efforts to create a distinction between a game of skill and a game of chance</strong>/gambling platforms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How have online gaming companies reacted?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The government’s move was “<strong>extremely unfortunate</strong>” as it will lead to “<strong>a nearly 1000% increase in taxation</strong>.”</li>
<li>The GST Council’s decision is “<strong>unconstitutional, irrational, and egregious</strong>” and will wipe out the entire Indian gaming industry and lead to <strong>lakhs of job losses.</strong></li>
<li>The only people benefitting from this will be <strong>anti-national illegal offshore platforms</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The government’s intention:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The moral question:</strong> The industry can’t be encouraged to such an extent over essential goods and services.</li>
<li><strong>Gaming a speculative and addictive activity:</strong><ul>
<li>Every week there is a story of <strong>suicides</strong> because of debts incurred due to online gaming.</li>
<li>The addiction has <strong>mainly impacted children and teenagers</strong> and along with higher taxes, the government needed to put in restrictions on the basis of age, income etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Goods and Services Tax (GST):</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>It is an <strong>indirect tax</strong> (not directly paid by customers to the government) that came into effect on July 1, 2017, as a result of the <strong>101st Amendment to the Indian Constitution</strong>.</li>
<li>It is imposed on both manufacturers and sellers of goods, as well as suppliers of services.</li>
<li>For tax collection, it is divided into five tax slabs – <strong>0%, 5%, 12%, 18%, and 28%.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About GST Council:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is <strong>an apex committee</strong> to modify, reconciles or make recommendations to the Union and the States on GST, like the goods and services that may be subjected or exempted from GST, model GST laws, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Article 279A</strong> of the Indian Constitution empowers the President of India to constitute a joint forum of the Centre and States called the GST Council.</li>

<h4 id="gs-paper-3_1"><strong>GS Paper 3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Environmental Pollution</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/pollution/air-pollution-impacts-villages-and-cities-almost-equally-but-pollution-control-funds-only-for-urban-india-shows-analysis-90611"><strong>DTE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> According to a CSE analysis, air pollution impacts villages and cities almost equally but pollution control measures target only urban India.</p>
<p><strong>Findings of the analysis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Particulate matter (PM) 5</strong> is an extremely potent air pollutant that can penetrate deep into the lungs and trigger a range of diseases including fatal ones.</li>
<li>In 2022, the annual average of the most toxic air pollutant – <strong>ultrafine particulate matter (PM) 5</strong>, was as poor in rural India as in urban India (~46 microgrammes against the national limit is 40 microgrammes).</li>
<li>The rural PM 5 pollution was found to be <strong>significantly high in Delhi</strong> (87 microgrammes) and states like Bihar, Haryana, UP, Rajasthan and West Bengal.</li>
<li><strong>The rural population suffers more than its urban counterpart</strong> when it comes to the length of losing life span due to exposure to the toxic pollutant.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steps taken – The National Clean Air Plan (NCAP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It was declared in 2019, with a tentative national level target of 20-30% reduction of PM 2.5 and PM 10 concentration by 2024.</li>
<li>So far it has released around <strong>Rs 9,000 crores mainly for 131 cities</strong> – called non-attainment ones – consistently going above the national air pollution limits.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Takeaways from the findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>They put under scanner the <strong>Union government’s policy of only investing in selected urban areas</strong> of the country for controlling toxic air pollution.</li>
<li>Most rural areas <strong>do not even have any on-ground pollution measuring mechanism</strong>; forget about combating it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Air pollution is a transboundary problem that knows no borders.</li>
<li>There is <strong>an urgent need to track pollution levels</strong> and develop policies for rural regions.</li>
<li><strong>A larger network of high-spatial-resolution</strong> systematic, robust and continuous air pollutants monitoring over the rural and non-urban regions is the need of the hour.</li>
<li>Instead of selected cities, the <strong>air shade arrangement model</strong> needs to be pursued.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The air pollution issue in the country in the recent decade would not be resolved unless the rural parts are taken into account. Therefore, the time is ripe for formulating policy and action in rural India as well.</p>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/energy/huge-phosphate-discovery-in-norway-could-fully-charge-the-electric-vehicle-industry-90559"><strong>DTE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> A huge deposit of a <strong>valuable mineral called phosphate</strong>, which can be used to power electric cars and solar panels, <strong>has been discovered in Norway.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There are up to <strong>70 billion tonnes of phosphorus in the deposit, enough to meet demand for the next 50 years.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Phosphorous:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Phosphorus is a <strong>mineral which comes from phosphate rock.</strong></li>
<li>It is a finite resource which means there is only a <strong>certain amount in the world and it will eventually run out.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Around 90% of mined phosphate is used to produce fertiliser</strong> for the agriculture industry.</li>
</ul>
<p>Previously, the largest amount of <strong>phosphate rock was found in Morocco’s western Sahara region</strong>, with approximately 50 billion tonnes. <strong>China (the largest phosphate producer in the world) and Egypt also have significant phosphate reserves.</strong></p>
<p>There are environmental concerns surrounding phosphate, <strong>including its role in causing algae blooms in waterways.</strong> The refining process for phosphorus extraction can be highly polluting.</p>
<p><strong>India:</strong></p>
<p>Phosphate rocks are also considered <strong>a significant and secondary resource of uranium</strong>. India is deficient in <strong>Apatite &amp; Rock Phosphate availability</strong>. In the case of apatite, India is fully dependent upon imports, while the <strong>Rock Phosphate production</strong> is only from two states namely<strong>, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> NASA’s Perseverance rover has discovered <strong>evidence of organic compounds in a Martian crater</strong>, providing <strong>insights into the potential habitability of Mars.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The study, published in the <strong>journal Nature</strong>, reveals a <strong>more complex organic geochemical cycle on Mars than previously thought</strong>, indicating the <strong>presence of multiple reservoirs of potential organic molecules on the planet.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The findings suggest that Mars has experienced <strong>aqueous processes and that water may have played a significant role in the existence of organic matter</strong>.</li>
<li>The research team used an instrument called <strong>the Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman and Luminescence for Organics and Chemicals (SHERLOC)</strong> to detect the organic compounds.</li>
<li>The <strong>rover’s landing site in Jezero Crater</strong>, which was once a lake basin, shows a high potential for past habitability, as it <strong>contains minerals such as carbonates, clays, and sulphates that could preserve organic compounds and traces of prehistoric life.</strong></li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> G20 negotiators led by Indian Sherpa (Amitabh Kant) are discussing the draft “Leader’s Declaration” for the Summit in Sept 2023.</p>
<p><strong>What is the Indian government aiming for?</strong> Expand the imprint of the Global South in the G20.</p>
<p><strong>How?</strong> India has inserted (in the revised draft) the proposal for the <strong>African Union (AU) membership</strong> in the G20.</p>
<p><strong>Other additions in the revised draft are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Gender-led development,</li>
<li>Digital public infrastructure and</li>
<li>Green hydrogen transitions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance of India’s Push to Expand G20:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Divert attention from the</strong> <strong>global polarisation:</strong> Over the war in Ukraine, that is holding up a joint statement at all India-led G20 events.</li>
<li><strong>Will make G20 a truly global body:</strong> With the AU joining the G20, <strong>90% of the global population will be represented</strong> by the grouping.<ul>
<li>Also, African countries are among the <strong>emerging market regions with the fastest-growing economies</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is aiding India’s push for G20 expansion?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The potential of developing nations:</strong> The G20 hosted by India represents the first time that developing countries form the <strong>troika</strong> (hosts for 2022-2023-2024) of Indonesia-India-Brazil.</li>
<li><strong>Over-representation of Europe in G20:</strong> A quarter of the grouping is made up of the UK, France, Germany, Italy and the EU (Spain is a permanent special invitee).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges towards adding AU in the G20:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competition from other contenders</strong>: These include regional groupings like the ASEAN and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), as well as countries like the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.</li>
<li><strong>Paralyse decision-making:</strong> Inducting the AU will also mean an exponential rise in the number of countries that can hold up the consensus over a G20 document, which is already paralysed by the Ukraine war.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> As India’s legacy as G20 President is already hanging between whether it can forge a joint statement or gather all G20 leaders under one roof, the inclusion of African countries may prove to be compensation.</p>
<p><strong>The African Union (AU):</strong></p>
