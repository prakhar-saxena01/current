<h4 id="gs-paper-1"><strong>GS Paper 1</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Effects of Globalization on Indian Society/ Social Empowerment, Communalism, Regionalism &amp; Secularism</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/behind-frances-street-violence-history-colonialism-flawed-assimilation-8699314/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> After the police killed a teenager (Nahel) of Algerian descent in Nanterre (France), violent protests spread across France.</p>
<p><strong>France’s ethnic composition:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>France is one of the <strong>most racially and ethnically diverse</strong> countries in Europe.</li>
<li>At least 32% of France’s population under 60 has at least one immigrant ancestor → trace their origins to countries <strong>outside Europe, especially Africa.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The French African colonies:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/french_africa.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/french_africa.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The formal French presence in Africa began with the capture of Madagascar in <strong>1642</strong> and the establishment of a port at Saint-Louis (present-day Senegal) in <strong>1659</strong>.</li>
<li>This was primarily fuelled by France’s desire <strong>to secure access to commodities such as gum Arabic and groundnuts</strong>, and the <strong>trans-Atlantic slave trade</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>A second phase of French colonisation</strong> began with the <strong>invasion of Algiers in 1830</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>By the early years of the 20th century</strong>, France held present-day Algeria, Morocco, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Benin, Guinea, Ivory Coast and Niger.</li>
<li>However, almost all of France’s African colonies achieved independence by <strong>1962</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The root cause behind the killing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Systemic racism in French policing</strong>: Young men who are Black/ of North African descent, are 20 times more likely to be subjected to police identity checks than the rest of the population.</li>
<li><strong>The Continuing France’s Sphere of Influence and Migration:</strong><ul>
<li>Critics say <strong>France’s exploitative relationship</strong> (Neocolonialism/ Last Stage of Imperialism) <strong>with its former colonies still continues</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>This includes</strong> repeatedly intervening in political affairs, having a considerable military presence and several economically extractive processes.</li>
<li><strong>An outcome of this situation</strong> – Africa’s continued impoverishment and the allure of European riches and quality of life – <strong>has been extensive migration from Africa to Europe</strong>.</li>
<li>For former French countries, France has been the preferred destination, where minimum wages and workers’ rights are assured.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The failure of assimilation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After World War II, France suffered from massive labour shortages and actively l<strong>ured cheap labour from its colonies.</strong></li>
<li>Over the decades, this led to a <strong>thriving African population in France,</strong> many of whom are today naturalised citizens.</li>
<li>However, France’s uniqueness lies in the <strong>“physical presence and conceptual absence of cultural difference”</strong> – as it does not see itself as a <strong>pluralist or multicultural society</strong>.</li>
<li>The French state has focussed on <strong>“assimilating” its diverse population into the “French ideal”</strong> by strictly adhering to political egalitarianism.</li>
<li>Yet, this attempt at assimilation has remained incomplete, leading to deep tensions in French society.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Discrimination:</strong> African immigrants are among the poorest in the country → lowest levels of education, the highest levels of unemployment → highest rates of crime → bear the brunt of police violence, accentuated by ingrained racial attitudes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lessons to be learnt from India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Secularism:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/secu.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/secu.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unity in diversity:</strong><ul>
<li>It relates to the state of togetherness or integrity despite the presence of infinite diversity.</li>
<li>In India, it can be seen through national integration, growth and development, global recognition and peaceful coexistence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> In the era of globalisation and increased migration, governments should prefer a <strong>‘salad bowl’</strong> (an intercultural society can integrate different cultures while maintaining their separate identities) rather than <strong>a ‘melting pot’</strong> (monoculture) metaphor<strong>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: The Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) recently <strong>ruled on affirmative action in college admissions, limiting its use</strong>. We already covered a summary of the News <strong>(</strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/30/affirmative-action-in-higher-education/"><strong>Affirmative Action in Higher Education</strong></a><strong>).</strong> Here we will compare the affirmative actions of India and the USA.</p>
<p><strong>Meaning of Affirmative Action:</strong></p>
<p>Affirmative action refers to <strong>policies and practices aimed</strong> at promoting <strong>equal opportunities for historically disadvantaged groups</strong>, particularly in areas such as <strong>education, employment, and government contracts</strong>.</p>
<p>It involves taking proactive steps to <strong>address past discrimination and promote diversity</strong> and <strong>inclusion</strong>. Affirmative action can involve measures such as <strong>preferential treatment, quotas, or targeted outreach programs</strong> to ensure representation and equal access to opportunities for underrepresented groups.</p>

<p><strong>The Argument for Affirmative Action:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Affirmative Action</strong> is a necessary policy to <strong>rectify the long-standing historical injustices</strong> faced by marginalized communities. It provides them with <strong>access to education, jobs, and public services, enabling social mobility and breaking</strong> the cycle of poverty. By promoting <strong>diversity and inclusion</strong>, reservation contributes to a more equitable and harmonious society.</p>
<p><strong>Argument Against Affirmative Actions:</strong> </p>
<p>While the intention of <strong>Affirmative Action</strong> is laudable, it has some unintended consequences. Reservation can lead to <strong>divisions and animosity among different groups</strong>, and it may perpetuate the <strong>notion of caste in society</strong>. It also hampers <strong>meritocracy</strong>, as deserving candidates may be overlooked in favour of less qualified candidates from reserved categories. Instead, a <strong>more targeted and comprehensive approach</strong> addressing economic backwardness could be considered.</p>
<p><strong>Way Forward:</strong></p>
<p>To strike a balance, <strong>Affirmative policies</strong> should be reevaluated to target the <strong>most marginalized and economically disadvantaged</strong> individuals rather than perpetuating caste-based reservations. A strong focus on <strong>quality education and skill development</strong> for all, regardless of caste or creed, will empower the marginalized and ensure equal opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Public awareness and dialogue on the purpose and implementation of reservation are essential to foster understanding and cooperation among diverse sections of society.</p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-24"><strong>GS Paper 2/4</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Development process and the development industry/ Corporate governance</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/impact-of-csr-funds-not-widely-felt-despite-jump-in-spending-mca/printarticle/101432747.cms"><strong>ET</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) has flagged the limited impact of corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives despite a spike in such spending in recent years.</p>
<p><strong>What is CSR?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is a <strong>commitment</strong> by businesses to integrate social and environmental concerns into their business operations.</li>
<li>India became the first country in the world to make corporate social responsibility (CSR) mandatory, following an amendment to <strong>the Companies Act, 2013 in April 2014</strong>.</li>
<li>Businesses can invest <strong>at least 2%</strong> of their net profit (over the preceding 3 years) <strong>in areas</strong> such as education, poverty, gender equality, and hunger as part of any CSR compliance.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance:</strong> Every company has a <strong>moral responsibility</strong> to play an active role in discharging social obligations, subject to the financial health of the company.</p>
<p><strong>CSR trends in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Since the applicability of the mandatory CSR provision in 2014, <strong>CSR spending by corporate India has increased significantly</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> CSR spending stood at Rs 26,210 crore in FY21, having grown 80% from FY16.</li>
<li><strong>The education sector received the maximum funding</strong> (38%) followed by hunger, poverty, and healthcare (25%), environmental sustainability (12%), and rural development (11%).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples of CSR in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tata Group:</strong> It has engaged in women empowerment activities, income generation, rural community development, and other social welfare programs.</li>
<li><strong>Ultratech Cement:</strong> The company has organised medical camps, immunisation programs, sanitization programs, water conservation programs, organic farming programs, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Mahindra &amp; Mahindra:</strong> It runs programs such as <strong>Nanhi Kali</strong> focusing on education for girls, Mahindra Pride Schools for industrial training, and Lifeline Express for healthcare services in remote areas.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Concerns:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fund.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fund.jpg?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The impact of the CSR funds is not widely felt</strong>.</li>
<li>Programs such as technology incubators, sports, and armed forces, reducing inequalities saw <strong>negligible spending.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Regional disparities</strong> as the Companies Act require companies should give preference to the areas around which they operate while allocating CSR funds.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Companies need to adopt <strong>a long-term approach</strong> “to yield productive results”. This will –<ul>
<li><strong>Enhance the visibility</strong> as well as the impact of invested funds</li>
<li><strong>Strike the right balance</strong> of capital investments and operational expenses</li>
<li>Ensure the initiatives undertaken become <strong>self-sustaining</strong> – running seamlessly without being a burden on the companies themselves.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The highest quality risk management framework</strong> needs to be adopted, so as to make the CSR projects sustainable</li>
<li>It is imperative to <strong>strike a balance between local area preferences with national priorities</strong> to avoid any concentration of CSR funds in specific regions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The emphasis should be on creating an appropriate structure for CSR, ensuring that the funds go towards the well-being of the community.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> With the implementation of a Goods and Services Tax (GST) on July 1 2017, India took a huge step towards modifying its indirect taxation system.</p>
<p><strong>About Goods and Services Tax (GST):</strong> </p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/gst_ind.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/gst_ind.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>It is an <strong>indirect tax</strong> (not directly paid by customers to the government) that came into effect on July 1, 2017, as a result of the <strong>101st Amendment to the Indian Constitution</strong>.</li>
<li>It is imposed on both manufacturers and sellers of goods, as well as suppliers of services.</li>
<li>For tax collection, it is divided into five tax slabs – <strong>0%, 5%, 12%, 18%, and 28%.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About GST Council:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is <strong>an apex committee</strong> to modify, reconciles or make recommendations to the Union and the States on GST, like the goods and services that may be subjected or exempted from GST, model GST laws, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Article 279A</strong> of the Indian Constitution empowers the President of India to constitute a joint forum of the Centre and States called the GST Council.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Need for GST:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The inclusion of several indirect taxes</strong> at various levels of the supply chain <strong>hampered the Indian tax system</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>This resulted in a complicated and fragmented tax framework</strong> that included excise duty, service tax, VAT, central sales tax (CST), and other taxes.</li>
<li>These led to tax <strong>cascading (tax on tax)</strong>, raising the entire tax burden on goods and services.</li>
<li>Hence, the primary goal of GST is –<ul>
<li><strong>To simplify the tax system by substituting a single indirect tax for several indirect levies</strong></li>
<li>Eliminating tax cascading by establishing a uniform tax structure</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Achievements of GST:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue collection:</strong><ul>
<li>The average growth rate of Gross GST revenue from 2018-19 to 2022-23 stands at <strong>3%</strong>, surpassing the nominal GDP growth rate of 9.8%.</li>
<li><strong>The (June 2023) collection has crossed the 1.6 lakh crore mark</strong> for the 4th time since the inception of GST.</li>
<li>This is noteworthy as indirect taxes <strong>typically exhibit lower buoyancy</strong> – an increase in its revenue rate without increasing the tax rate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>A seamless market and digitised compliance:</strong><ul>
<li>GST laid the foundation for a seamless national market, r<strong>eshaping India’s tax landscape and driving economic growth</strong>.</li>
<li>By digitising processes from registration to return filing, the GST portal ensured <strong>smoother compliance for businesses, fostering a tech-enabled environment</strong>.</li>
<li>It paved the way for <strong>other significant indirect tax reforms, including e-way bills and e-invoicing</strong>, promoting transparent data sharing between businesses and the government.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Empowering the manufacturing sector:</strong> GST’s impact on the manufacturing sector was remarkable, as it eliminated the cascading effect of taxes and reduced manufacturing costs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges still persisting:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complexities</strong> in return forms and the <strong>ambiguity</strong> surrounding tax rates and <strong>classifications</strong> of certain goods and services lead to <strong>disputes and uncertainty</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Combating tax fraud remained a priority</strong>, with measures in place to ensure compliance and weed out fraudulent businesses.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Some areas that deserve attention are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Commence taxation</strong> of petroleum crude, high-speed diesel, petrol, natural gas and aviation turbine fuel and similarly, alcohol meant for human consumption;</li>
<li><strong>Inclusion of other levies</strong> such as electricity duty, stamp duty, etc;</li>
<li><strong>Clarifying</strong> taxation of online gaming activities, transactions involving cryptocurrency, etc.</li>
<li><strong>The officials should also look into</strong> rationalisation of the tax rates (slabs); upgrading the law to deal with a digital world and keep up with the various technological developments.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The implementation of GST has definitely been a success <strong>but is still a new reform with the potential to witness phenomenal growth and harmonisation</strong> in the coming years.</li>
<li><strong>GST has shown immense promise</strong>, reshaping the economy and driving digitization while also confronting challenges and fraud.</li>
