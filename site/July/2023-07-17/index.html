<h4 id="gs-paper-2"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Structure, Organization and Functioning of the Judiciary</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-collegiums-quiet-transparency-is-driving-a-change/article67087258.ece#:~:text=Since%20early%20this%20year%2C%20the,court%20and%20the%20High%20Courts."><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The SC Collegium under CJI DY Chandrachud has quietly and transparently streamlined the appointment process of judges to the constitutional courts.</p>
<p><strong>The Collegium system:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>About:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>The collegium system,</strong> which has evolved through judgments of the SC, is the way by which judges of the SC and HCs are <strong>appointed and transferred</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>It is a five-member body</strong>, headed by the incumbent CJI and comprises the four other senior most judges of the SC at that time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Evolution – Three Judges Cases:</strong><ul>
<li>P. Gupta &amp; Others v. Union of India (1981), Advocate on Record Association v. UoI (1993) and re Presidential Reference case (1998).</li>
<li>It was established that the recommendation made by the CJI <strong>without following the consultation process</strong> for the appointment of SC and HC Judges is <strong>not binding</strong> on the government.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Criticism:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>The system is non-transparent</strong> since it is seen as a closed-door affair with no prescribed norms regarding eligibility criteria, or selection procedure.</li>
<li><strong>The system is opaque and not accountable</strong>. Judges do not appoint judges all over the world, but in India, they do.</li>
<li><strong>Limited role of the government,</strong> may object to and seek clarification on the collegium’s choices, but if the collegium reiterates the same names, the government is bound to appoint them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Efforts to reform the collegium system:</strong> NJAC, Memorandum of Procedure (MoP), etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/njac.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/njac.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>How has the appointment process been streamlined recently?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adding a balanced mix of merit and seniority</strong> through a selection procedure which involves meaningful discussion on and assessment of candidates’ judicial acumen.</li>
<li><strong>Recommendations of the Collegium are now notified within days by the government.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The requirements for candidates</strong>’ <strong>consideration</strong> have been made public by the Collegium’s resolutions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Points under the Collegium’s consideration:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quality of judgments of the candidates:</strong> A Judgment Evaluation Committee goes through the judicial work of the candidates.<ul>
<li><strong>Justice Dipankar Dutta’s</strong> name was the first to be cleared for SC appointment by the Collegium in this manner.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The seniority of Chief Justices and senior puisne Judges</strong> in their respective parent HCs as well as overall seniority of the HC Judges.</li>
<li><strong>The merit, performance and integrity</strong> of the judges are under consideration.</li>
<li><strong>The need to ensure diversity and inclusion</strong> in the SC. Diversity and inclusion means –<ul>
<li>Representation of HC not/inadequately represented;</li>
<li>Appointment of persons from marginalised and backward segments of society;</li>
<li>Gender diversity (Justice Sunita Agarwal appointed as the CJ of the Gujarat HC); and</li>
<li>Representation of minorities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The need to ensure the better administration of justice:</strong> As a result, the Collegium did not bow to the request made by three HC judges against their out-of-State transfers.</li>

<h4 id="gs-paper-2_1"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Pressure Groups &amp; Formal/informal Associations &amp; Their Role in Polity</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/are-regional-parties-in-india-facing-a-succession-problem/article67076019.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> 24 years after its formation, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) split over the question of succession.</p>
<p><strong>Similar cases:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Shiv Sena,</strong> <strong>Samajwadi Party (SP)</strong> have gone through this churn.</li>
<li><strong>The Biju Janata Dal (BJD)</strong> seems poised to undergo this churn.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The rise of regional parties in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It coincided with the decline of Congress in the <strong>1990s</strong>.</li>
<li>They were basically <strong>caste-based alignments</strong>, with the Mandal movement providing the necessary prompt.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Characteristics of regional parties in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Have a regional agenda</strong> (concentrates on regional or local matters) and recognise a distinct religious, ethnic, cultural or linguistic group.</li>
<li><strong>The electoral ground</strong> is restricted to a specific state or region.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reasons for succession battles in several regional parties in India today:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Have become ‘Hindu undivided families’:</strong> Consisting of all those who have directly descended from a common ancestor as well as their wives and unmarried daughters.</li>
<li><strong>Have given up their larger purpose:</strong><ul>
<li>Many of these parties began with the goals of promoting sub-nationalism, protecting their own caste or ethnicity and larger federal interests (DMK).</li>
<li>But over a period of time, <strong>they have all become parties strangled in family feuds</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Have a centralised party structure</strong>, <em>low intra-party</em> <strong>democracy</strong>, and are often <strong>controlled by a single family.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Have not evolved with time:</strong> There is splintering within castes and caste identity itself has gone through a lot of change.<ul>
<li><strong>The ideological divide is thinning,</strong> forcing everybody to go beyond family, caste, or ethnic loyalty to create a larger purpose.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implications of these succession battles:</strong> With the decline of regional parties, <strong>the challenges to a dominant party system will reduce</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges for regional parties:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The paradox</strong> about regional parties is that the family is central to their survival, but the family is also a liability.</li>
<li><strong>Absence of charismatic leaders:</strong> For example, for the BJD, who will be the leader after Naveen Patnaik is a worrying question.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The regional parties have to come up with an <strong>internal decision-making process</strong> for anointing the next leader.</li>
<li>These regional parties can have a <strong>think tank</strong> (like RSS for BJP) that sits as the arbitrator to look for an alternative when required.</li>

<p><strong>About the SCoS:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It will replace:</strong> The Standing Committee on Economic Statistics (SCES), which was constituted in 2019 to examine economic indicators only.</li>
<li><strong>Chairman:</strong> India’s first chief statistician and the former chairman of the NSC – <strong>Pronab Sen</strong>, has been named the chair of the new committee.</li>
<li><strong>Mandate:</strong><ul>
<li>To provide a new internal oversight mechanism for official data, and</li>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: The Indian Union government is <strong>reluctant to declare lightning a natural</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/disaster-management/background-of-disaster-management/types-of-disaster/"><strong>disaster</strong></a>, as it believes that deaths <strong>caused by lightning can be prevented through awareness of safety measures</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>India <strong>currently has an early warning system for lightning</strong>, providing forecasts <strong>from five days to up to three hours in advance.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Some states like <strong>Bihar and West Bengal have been urging the government to classify lightning deaths as natural disasters.</strong> If declared, victims would be eligible for compensation from the <strong>State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF), with the central government contributing 75% to the fund.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Status of death due to lightning:</strong> According to <strong>data from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB),</strong> lightning strikes <strong>caused 2,880 deaths in 2021, accounting for 40% of all accidental deaths</strong> caused by natural forces.</p>
<p><strong>What is a Disaster?</strong></p>
<p>A disaster is a result of <strong>natural or man-made causes that leads to sudden disruption of normal life</strong>, causing severe <strong>damage to life and property</strong> to an extent that available <strong>social and economic protection mechanisms are inadequate to cope.</strong></p>
<p>In India, the criteria for declaring a disaster as a natural disaster are typically based on the guidelines provided by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).</p>

<ol>
<li>Robert Oppenheimer was the <strong>scientific director of the Manhattan Project</strong>, the USA’s World War II program to develop the first nuclear weapons. He is known as the <strong>“Father of the Atomic Bomb”.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>However, after witnessing the destructive power of nuclear weapons, Oppenheimer became a <strong>vocal advocate against their proliferation</strong>. He found solace and philosophical guidance in the Bhagavad Gita, quoting the famous line <strong>“I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.”</strong></p>
<p>Oppenheimer <strong>actively opposed nuclear weapons</strong> and worked to curtail their spread. Unfortunately, he faced <strong>political persecution during the Cold War era</strong> and lost his security clearance. Today, Oppenheimer’s story serves as a cautionary tale and highlights the ethical dilemmas faced by scientists involved in creating powerful weapons.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Moral Responsibility</strong>: Scientists must consider the potential destruction and harm caused by their weapons.</li>
<li><strong>Dual-Use Technology:</strong> The technologies they create can be misused or have unintended consequences, raising ethical concerns.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on Innocent Lives:</strong> Scientists question the effects on civilians, as powerful weapons often cause collateral damage.</li>
<li><strong>Contributing to Conflict</strong>: Scientists grapple with the ethical dilemma of their work potentially exacerbating conflicts and violence.</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Consequences</strong>: Scientists must weigh the lasting effects, including proliferation and the risk of an arms race.</li>
<li><strong>Personal Accountability:</strong> Scientists may face moral conflicts and be held accountable for the ethical implications of their inventions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>There are three principles for conduct in war</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discrimination</strong> (distinguishing between enemy combatants and non-combatants)</li>
<li><strong>Proportionality</strong> (the harms must be proportional to the gains)</li>
<li>Actions must be <strong>militarily necessary</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: J Robert Oppenheimer used this quote to display regrets about his invention of nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>The quote <strong>“Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds”</strong> is not directly from the Bhagavad Gita but rather a paraphrase of a verse in the Gita.</p>
<p><strong>Translated into English, this verse means</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>“The Supreme Lord said: Time I am, the great destroyer of the worlds, and I have come here to destroy all people.”</strong></p>
<p>The verse is part of a <strong>conversation between Lord Krishna and Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra</strong>. Krishna reveals his <strong>universal form</strong>, a divine manifestation displaying his supreme power and <strong>cosmic nature</strong>. Arjuna is <strong>awe-struck and becomes aware of the immense destructive power that Krishna</strong> wields as the <strong>God</strong> <strong>of Time.</strong> </p>
<p>Oppenheimer, who was familiar with the Bhagavad Gita, invoked this quote to <strong>express the profound impact and consequences of the atomic bomb</strong>, which, like Krishna, brought immense destructive power and the potential to annihilate entire worlds.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> A study by researchers at the <strong>Institute for Human Genetics</strong>, University of California, focused on <strong>genetic differences among South Asian populations, particularly in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The researchers found <strong>distinct genetic patterns among different regions, including smaller geographies within India, attributed to endogamous practices like caste-based and region-based marriages</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Endogamy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Endogamy is the practice of <strong>marrying within a specific social, cultural, or ethnic group, often with the aim of preserving traditions, customs, and identity within that group.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The study also revealed a worrying trend of <strong>higher frequency of homozygous genotypes in the South Asian cohort, which can increase the risk of genetic disorders</strong>.</li>
<li>The research highlighted the need for a <strong>detailed map of the Indian genome to understand the country’s incredible diversity and address major hereditary disorders</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Conducting such studies within the country would also <strong>protect vulnerable communities from exploitation</strong>. Harnessing the power of genetic studies <strong>could lead to interventions for major health concerns in India.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: The conservation <strong>status of the hoolock gibbon</strong>, <strong>India’s only ape species</strong>, has become a matter of <strong>concern at a global event on gibbons held in China.</strong></p>
<p><strong>About Gibbons:</strong></p>
<p><strong>It is the smallest and fastest ape</strong> and is found in <strong>tropical and subtropical forests</strong> in Southeast Asia. The hoolock gibbon, <strong>unique to India’s northeast, is one of the 20 gibbon species on Earth, with an estimated population of 12,000.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All 20 gibbon species, including the <strong>hoolock gibbon</strong>, are at a <strong>high risk of extinction due to dramatic declines in their distribution and populations since 1900,</strong> leaving only <strong>small populations in tropical rainforests.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Threats:</strong> The primary threat to the hoolock gibbon in India is the <strong>felling of trees for infrastructure projects.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Initiatives</strong>: The <strong>Global Gibbon Network (GGN)</strong> aims to <strong>protect and conserve gibbons</strong> and their habitats by <strong>promoting participatory conservation policies and actions</strong>.<ul>
<li><strong>Aaranyak</strong>, a non-profit conservation organization based in Assam, India, <strong>is one of the founding organizations of the GGN from seven countries.</strong></li>

<p><strong>Controversy regarding conservation status:</strong></p>
<p>Initially believed to be two separate species, a genetic analysis by the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) in Hyderabad in 2021 revealed that there is <strong>only one species of ape in India, the hoolock gibbon</strong>.</p>
<p>However, the <strong>International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List classifies the western hoolock gibbon as endangered and the eastern hoolock gibbon as vulnerable</strong>, which adds complexity to their conservation status.</p>

<p>North Korea <strong>conducted a test of its new Hwasong-18 intercontinental ballistic missile</strong> (ICBM) using <strong>solid propellants</strong>. The test has drawn reactions from neighbouring countries, with Japan, South Korea, and the United States expressing concerns about regional stability and emphasizing the need for closer cooperation and denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<p>North Korea is a country in East Asia. It constitutes the <strong>northern half of the Korean Peninsula and borders China and Russia to the north at the Yalu and Tumen rivers,</strong> and South Korea to the south at the Korean Demilitarized Zone. The war between North Korea and South Korea began in 1950 and both governments claimed to be the <strong>sole legitimate government of all of Korea</strong>, and neither <strong>accepted the border as permanent</strong>.</p>
