<h4 id="gs-paper-3"><strong>GS Paper 3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Conservation, Environmental Pollution and Degradation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/water/managing-microplastic-pollution-is-important-for-meeting-sustainable-development-goals-in-india-90789"><strong>DTE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Microplastic pollution – a significant environmental problem, has not attracted much attention in India.</p>
<p><strong>Microplastics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>These are <strong>tiny plastic particles</strong> (less than 5 mm long) that result from both commercial product development (microbeads in personal care products, synthetic fibres from clothing, etc) and the breakdown of larger plastics.</li>
<li><strong>They are found everywhere</strong>, from terrestrial ecosystems to freshwater rivers, lakes, ponds, estuaries, seas and oceans, even in Antarctica.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Threats posed by microplastics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Microplastics are not only <strong>toxic</strong> for the ecosystems but also act as <strong>vectors</strong> to transport other toxic chemicals in the aquatic ecosystems.</li>
<li><strong>As a pollutant</strong>, microplastics are a significant <strong>environmental problem</strong> and pose risks to marine life, terrestrial organisms and <strong>human health</strong>.</li>
<li>As a result, many scientists are using a new historical epoch – <strong>Plasticene</strong>, due to the global distribution and abundance of microplastics.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Factors contributing to microplastic pollution in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rapid industrialisation, urbanisation and population growth</strong> have led to increased plastic consumption and waste generation.</li>
<li><strong>Inadequate waste management systems</strong>, including limited recycling infrastructure and improper disposal practices. <strong>For example,</strong><ul>
<li>Municipal areas in India generate 133,760 metric tonnes per day (TPD) of municipal solid waste (MSW).</li>
<li>Of which only 91,152 TPD waste is collected and 25,884 TPD treated.</li>
<li><strong>Of which only 9,250 TPD plastic waste is recycled.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The vast coastline and numerous rivers</strong> make it susceptible to the transport of microplastics from inland areas to the marine environment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges India is facing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Most populous country</strong> in the world with a population of 1.42 billion → Demand for water is rising.</li>
<li><strong>Access to water</strong> plays a critical role in <strong>all 17 SDGs</strong> either directly or indirectly.</li>
<li><strong>Misuse, poor management and contamination of freshwater systems</strong> have amplified the water stress.</li>
<li>Thus, achieving SDGs by 2030 is a mammoth task amid microplastic pollution.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Some SDGs that have direct and intricate relations with water:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>SDG 2: Zero hunger</li>
<li>SDG 3: Good health and well-being</li>
<li>SDG 6: Clean water and sanitation</li>
<li>SDG 7: Affordable and clean energy</li>
<li>SDG 14: Life below water</li>
<li>SDG 15: Life on land</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steps taken in India:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/environment.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/environment.png" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Plastic Waste Management Amendment Rules 2021</strong> prohibited single-use plastic items by the end of 2022.</li>
<li><strong>The permissible thickness of plastic carry bags</strong> was increased from 50 to 75 microns and then 120 microns from December 31, 2022.</li>
<li><strong>Several nonprofits and civil society organisations</strong> (Bengaluru-based <strong>Saahas</strong>) are actively working to tackle the issue through research, advocacy and community engagement.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus on the key targets of SDG 6:</strong><ul>
<li>Achieving universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all.</li>
<li>Improve water quality by reducing pollution and increasing water treatment.</li>
<li>Increase water-use efficiency in all sectors and ensure sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater.</li>
<li>Implement integrated water resources management to support the sustainable use of water resources.</li>
<li>Protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>India should focus on improving waste management infrastructure</strong>, promoting recycling and responsible consumption and raising awareness among the public and industries.</li>
<li><strong>It is essential to implement stricter regulations</strong>, enhance monitoring and research on microplastics and promote sustainable alternatives to single-use plastics.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> It is important to note that managing microplastics is a complex task that requires a comprehensive approach involving government agencies, industries, communities and individuals working together to reduce plastic waste and protect the environment.</p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-3_1"><strong>GS Paper 3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Disaster Management</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1941689#:~:text=The%20objective%20of%20the%20Plan,which%20caters%20to%20disaster%20preparedness%2C"><strong>PIB</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Union Ministry of Jal Shakti has released the Manual for Disaster Management Plan (DMP).</p>
<p><strong>About the Manual for DMP:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Developed by:</strong> The Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Ministry of Jal Shakti, based on the Advisory issued by the <strong>National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA),</strong> under the Disaster Management Act 2005.</li>
<li><strong>Objective:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>To ensure safety</strong>, uninterrupted supply and minimum loss of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) assets and services involving stakeholders at the national, state, district, and village levels.</li>
<li><strong>Enhance WASH resilience</strong> to reduce disaster vulnerability.</li>
<li>Establish a <strong>robust environment, fund and coordination mechanism</strong> to achieve the desired goals.</li>
<li>Develop a plan which caters to <strong>disaster preparedness, response, recovery, reconstruction, and mitigation.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The plan includes</strong> Gender-based vulnerabilities, and issues concerning SC/ST, elderly, children and people with disabilities.</li>
<li><strong>The Plan aligns with</strong> The two-flagship programmes on WASH implemented by the Department namely the <strong>Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) and Swachh Bharat Mission-Gramin (SBM-G).</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/involved.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/involved.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>In case of disaster, 3 kinds of assessment need to be conducted:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Before the disaster:</strong> A Hazard-Vulnerability-Capacity mapping to guide the preparedness activities most needed,</li>
<li><strong>During Response:</strong> A Rapid Needs Assessment (RNA) which can be completed in a day and point out the immediate needs of the affected population,</li>
<li><strong>During Recovery and Reconstruction:</strong> A detailed Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) which –<ul>
<li>Highlights the long-term needs of the community and</li>
<li>Helps the administration <strong>“build back better” and “update”</strong> to mitigate against future disasters.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Indian efforts towards reducing the risk of disasters:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>G20 Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) Working Group:</strong> India has established the first G20 Working Group on DRR to elevate DRR as a priority for G20 through its presidency.</li>
<li><strong>Expanding disaster early warning:</strong> During Cyclone Biparjoy, effective systems for end-to-end early warning and action helped achieve zero deaths from the event in India.</li>
<li><strong>UN Secretary General’s Early Warnings for All Initiative:</strong> India is working to realise the goal of the initiative, which seeks to create universal coverage for everyone by the end of 2027.</li>
<li><strong>Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CRDI):</strong> India launched CRDI with the UN in 2019, to spur policy development and capacity support for disaster resilient infrastructure, especially in developing countries.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best practices – Disaster response in Odisha:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sneha Abhiyaan:</strong> Under this, self-help groups (SHGs) in the village are entrusted with managing cyclone shelters, including the distribution of cooked food.</li>
<li><strong>Mamta Gruhas:</strong> These safe spaces provide comprehensive care for women, children and other vulnerable sections of society.</li>
<li><strong>Training and capacity building of frontline workers (ASHAs, SHGs):</strong> SDRF provides training in first aid, shelter management, rescue operations, government regulations concerning trafficking and compensation norms.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To build resilience within affected communities, it is essential to focus on <strong>long-term rehabilitation.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The leadership of women collectives</strong> plays a vital role in this process.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> As the world is at the midpoint of the <strong>Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030,</strong> a renewed sense of urgency and a people-centred approach can significantly reduce disaster losses by 2030.</p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-4"><strong>GS Paper 4</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus: Ethics in public and private life, Media ethics</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/explained-bbc-presenter-scandal-a-look-at-timeline-of-events-allegations-media-response/article67083010.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p>The BBC is currently embroiled in a scandal involving its star news presenter, Huw Edwards, who is accused of <strong>paying a teenager for sexually explicit photos since 2020</strong>.</p>
<p>The BBC <strong>suspended Edwards after the allegations emerged</strong> and has been investigating the matter. <strong>The London Metropolitan Police</strong> concluded their assessment and found <strong>no indication of a criminal offence</strong></p>
<p>The scandal has sparked scrutiny of the <strong>BBC’s handling of complaints</strong> and has led to calls for <strong>accountability from the top management</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Ethical issues involved in the case are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consent and Exploitation</strong>: The alleged exchange of <strong>sexually explicit photos</strong> with a teenager raises serious ethical concerns regarding consent.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy and Confidentiality</strong>: The scandal involves the breach of privacy of individuals, including the accused presenter and the teenager.</li>
<li><strong>Handling of Complaints</strong>: The BBC’s handling of the initial complaint against the presenter in May raises ethical concerns.</li>
<li><strong>Abuse of Influence</strong>: As a high-profile news presenter, the accused presenter holds a position of influence and power. Any abuse of that power, especially for personal gain, raises ethical questions about the responsibility that comes with such a position.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency and Accountability</strong>: Ethical concerns arise regarding the transparency of the <strong>BBC’s investigation process and its accountability</strong> in addressing the allegations promptly and effectively.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on Reputation</strong>: The scandal could have significant repercussions on the reputation of the accused presenter, the BBC, and other individuals mentioned in the media coverage.</li>
<li><strong>Protection of Minors:</strong> The involvement of a teenager in the alleged exchange of explicit photos raises concerns about the protection of minors and the potential harm they may face from such incidents.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Addressing these ethical issues requires several steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thorough Investigation:</strong> The BBC must continue its investigation into the allegations, <strong>considering all available evidence</strong>, and cooperating with relevant authorities.</li>
<li><strong>Support for Victims:</strong> The teenager involved should be <strong>provided with necessary support and counselling to cope</strong> with the potential harm caused by the incident.</li>
<li><strong>Accountability and Transparency</strong>: The BBC should <strong>demonstrate transparency</strong> in its <strong>investigative process</strong> and be accountable for any mistakes in handling complaints.</li>
<li><strong>Ethical Training</strong>: Regular ethics training for all employees, especially those in positions of influence, can help prevent similar incidents and promote responsible behaviour.</li>
<li><strong>Restorative Justice</strong>: If the allegations are proven, <strong>restorative justice measures</strong> may be considered to address the harm caused to the victim and foster a sense of accountability.</li>
<li><strong>Rebuilding Trust</strong>: The BBC must take steps to <strong>rebuild trust with its audience</strong> by demonstrating a commitment to <strong>ethical standards and values</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Strengthening Policies:</strong> Reviewing and improving <strong>internal policies related to handling complaints,</strong> privacy protection, and the responsible use of influence can help prevent similar scandals in the future.</li>

<h4 id="facts-for-prelims-ffp_1"><strong>Facts for Prelims (FFP)</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/health-wellness/geneva-hiv-patient-cured-stem-cell-transplant-8854081/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: A sixth person, known as the <strong>Geneva patient,</strong> has likely been cured of HIV after receiving a <strong>stem cell transplant for leukaemia</strong>. His virus level remained undetectable 20 months after discontinuing antiretroviral therapy.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, his <strong>cells are still susceptible to HIV,</strong> leaving the possibility of the virus returning.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is a stem cell transplant?</strong> </p>
<p>A stem cell transplant (SCT) is a <strong>medical procedure in which healthy stem cells</strong> are infused into a patient to <strong>replace damaged or diseased stem cells</strong>. Stem cells are special human cells that can replicate and differentiate into various types of cells in the body. The transplant aims to <strong>restore the body’s ability to produce healthy blood cells</strong>, boost the immune system, and treat certain diseases like <strong>leukaemia and lymphoma.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/work.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/work.jpg?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Can SCT be used for treating all HIV patients?</strong></p>
<p>Stem cell transplant is <strong>unlikely to become a routine treatment for HIV</strong> due to challenges in finding <strong>matching donors and the mutation being mainly found in Caucasians</strong>. Stem cell transplantation also comes with risks, such as <strong>the risk of patient rejection</strong> and the virus finding other ways to infect cells.</p>
<p><strong>Why Caucasians are able to recover while other races are not?</strong> </p>
<p>The recovery of HIV through stem cell transplantation has been <strong>more commonly observed in Caucasians because a specific gene mutation known as CCR5 delta 32</strong> is more prevalent in this racial group. People who inherit <strong>two copies of this mutation</strong> (one from each parent) are <strong>naturally resistant to certain strains of HIV</strong> due to the lack of receptors on their immune cells that the virus uses to enter and infect the cells.</p>
<p><strong>Effective antiretroviral therapy remains the primary treatment for HIV</strong>, suppressing the virus and allowing <strong>CD4 immune cell count to bounce back</strong>. Although it doesn’t remove the virus completely, <strong>it reduces viral particles</strong> to undetectable levels and prevents transmission to others.</p>
<p>Other patients who have achieved HIV remission through stem cell transplantation include the Berlin patient, the London patient, and the New York patient. Stem cell therapy using <strong>umbilical cord and adult stem cells may make transplants possible in people from other races as well.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> India is taking its <strong>first step towards introducing Controlled Human Infection Studies (CHIS),</strong> a research model used in other countries for vaccine and treatment development.</p>
<p><strong>What is CHIS?</strong></p>
<p>It is a research model used to <strong>intentionally expose healthy volunteers to pathogens in a controlled environment</strong> to study diseases and develop vaccines and treatments for diseases like malaria, typhoid, and dengue. The goal is to gain insights into <strong>disease pathogenesis</strong> and find efficient and cost-effective ways to prevent and treat infectious diseases.</p>
<p><strong>The issues with CHIS (Controlled Human Infection Studies) include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ethical Sensitivity:</strong> CHIS involves intentionally exposing healthy volunteers to pathogens, raising concerns about deliberate harm and protecting participants’ rights.</li>
<li><strong>Disproportionate Payment</strong>: Concerns about inducements and potential financial incentives for volunteers to participate in risky studies.</li>
<li><strong>Third-Party Risk</strong>: The risk of transmission of the pathogen to individuals outside the study, leading to potential community spread.</li>
<li><strong>Research with Vulnerable Participants:</strong> Ensuring that vulnerable individuals, such as pregnant women or children, are not exposed to undue risks during CHIS.</li>
<li><strong>Technical and Clinical Challenges</strong>: Ensuring proper scientific procedures and safety protocols are followed in the controlled environment.</li>
<li><strong>Legal Contentions:</strong> Addressing potential legal issues related to participant consent and liability.</li>
<li><strong>Socio-Cultural Context</strong>: Considering unique socio-cultural factors that may impact the acceptability and feasibility of CHIS in different communities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) Bioethics Unit</strong> has introduced a consensus policy statement, open for public comment, to address the ethical concerns associated with CHIS. The aim is to conduct research in India <strong>while protecting human participants and ensuring ethical principles</strong> are upheld.</p>
