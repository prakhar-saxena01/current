<h4 id="gs-paper-1"><strong>GS Paper 1</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Women-related issues</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/who-is-accountable-in-manipur-8850423/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> A video of two Kuki women being paraded naked by a mob during the ongoing clashes in Manipur is circulating on social media.</p>
<p><strong>The larger question:</strong> Women’s bodies have become sites of male violence, especially during communally charged conflicts.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons behind this grim reality:</strong> India’s social contract [an implicit agreement among the members of a society to cooperate for social benefits, by sacrificing some individual freedom for state protection] seems to be melting.</p>
<p><strong>Two aspects of this meltdown:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The systems of violence in and around Manipur.</li>
<li>The structures of silence around it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The systems of violence in and around Manipur:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The state is witnessing civil strife.</li>
<li><strong>Social cleavages</strong> between Meitei and Zo-Kuki communities have turned into a <strong>partition</strong> with well over a hundred dead, and thousands displaced.</li>
<li><strong>Even the state administration stands partitioned</strong>. Meitei police officers don’t operate in the hills, and Kuki-Zo officers don’t operate in the Valley.</li>
<li>Essentially, <strong>India is witnessing fresh partitions</strong> and associated armed ethnic mobilisation in Northeast India.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Such systems of violence are a by-product of</strong> Competing desires for regional hegemony – demands for access to resources and power within the Union and <strong>vote-bank politics</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The structures of silence:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It relates to what feminist scholars called <strong>systemic violence against women</strong> in Manipur.</li>
<li>It took <strong>a leaked video and associated public shock</strong> for Manipur police to order an investigation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The issue of gender-based violence in conflicts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Unfortunately, the issue <strong>has not received adequate attention</strong> in the discourse on gender equality and sustainable development.</li>
<li>Sexual violence in conflict zones has often been regarded as an inevitable by-product of civil strife/ war and the <strong>perpetrators of violence have seldom been punished.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What needs to be done?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Addressing the deeply entrenched patriarchal attitudes</strong> of the administration (say, police) to improve reporting and conviction rates.</li>
<li><strong>Bridging the gap</strong> between gender-based violence laws.</li>
<li><strong>SDG 5 calls for ending violence against women and girls</strong> in public and private spheres. As India is committed to the achievement of SDGs, <strong>the governments need to take a tough stance</strong> against the perpetrators of violence (in scenarios like Manipur).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>India’s social contract seems to be weakening because wrongdoers in power aren’t being held accountable.</li>
<li>Whether it is Manipur or Delhi, where India’s wrestling champions have been fighting for justice against sexual harassment by those in power, <strong>the only way to deliver justice is to ensure accountability.</strong></li>

<h4 id="gs-paper-2"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus: Statutory bodies</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/explained-senthilbalaji-case-what-has-the-sc-said-about-eds-powers-to-arrest-and-seek-custody-in-the-past/article67089535.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Madras High Court <strong>upheld the legality of Tamil Nadu Minister V. Senthilbalaji’s arrest by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in a money-laundering case</strong> linked to a <strong>cash-for-jobs scam.</strong></p>
<p><strong>HC observations in the case:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ED can subject any person accused in a case booked under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) to custodial interrogation</strong></li>
<li><strong>ED officials are not police officers</strong> as per the law laid down by the Supreme Court in <strong>Vijay Madanlal Choudhary v. Union of India (2022)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Previously,</strong></p>
<p><strong>In Central Bureau of Investigation v. Anupam J. Kulkarni (1992),</strong> the Supreme Court laid down the law that <strong>no police custody can be allowed beyond the first 15 days</strong> from the date of arrest; any further remand during an investigation can only be in judicial custody.</p>
<p>However, SC (in April this year) said that <strong>money laundering is an independent offence</strong>; if an arrest is possible then seeking custody for further investigation is permissible. Also, SC has said previously that <strong>interim protection granted against CBI action</strong> cannot operate against <strong>the ED</strong> even if the underlying allegations are similar.</p>
<p><strong>What is Custodial interrogation?</strong></p>
<p>It refers to the <strong>questioning of a suspect or accused by law enforcement</strong> authorities while they are in their custody or under arrest. Under the Indian Constitution and the Indian Penal Code (IPC), <strong>custodial interrogation is permissible</strong>, but it must be carried out in accordance with the <strong>rights and protections granted to individuals under Article 20(3)</strong> of the Constitution and Section 161(2) of the IPC, which safeguard <strong>against self-incrimination during questioning.</strong></p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-2_1"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Issues related to health</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/oral-poliovirus-vaccine-role-disease-transmission/article67105487.ece#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20being%20inexpensive,called%20the%20mucosal%20immune%20response"><strong>TH</strong></a>.)</p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> It seems that the last mile to realising the dream of a polio-free world is going to be challenging.</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The US, UK and Israel recently reported polio cases</strong> in unvaccinated people after having been polio-free for more than a decade.</li>
<li>Their silent outbreaks in countries with <strong>excellent sanitation and hygiene infrastructure have raised eyebrows</strong>, adding a new dimension to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Polioviruses:</strong> These are <strong>enteroviruses</strong> that are transmitted primarily by the <strong>faecal-oral route</strong>. There are <strong>different types of polio vaccines</strong> available.</p>
<p><strong>The oral polio vaccine (OPV)</strong>: It is a live attenuated vaccine, that contains weakened polioviruses (all three types – 1, 2, and 3) to induce an immune response in the human body without causing disease.</p>
<p><strong>The advantages of the OPV:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inexpensive and easy to administer</strong> to a large population and can help prevent transmission.</li>
<li><strong>It triggers a robust immune response</strong> in the gut lining (called the mucosal immune response) in addition to the significant immune response in the blood (the systemic immune response).</li>
<li><strong>It is excellent at preventing disease</strong> as well as person-to-person transmission of the virus.</li>
<li><strong>It is also easier to manufacture</strong> as the “seed virus” required for the vaccine is an attenuated (weakened form) virus.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Drawbacks of the OPV:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Its ‘uptake’ by the immune system</strong> after being administered is not as good as is desirable, especially in developing countries like India.</li>
<li><strong>The OPV can reverse the virus’s neurovirulence in rare cases</strong>, leading to vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP).</li>
<li>When the virus’s ability to jump from one person to another is restored, the result can be <strong>vaccine-derived paralytic poliomyelitis</strong> (VDPVs).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The inactivated polio vaccine (IPV):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It contains inactivated polioviruses (all three types) and is administered by <strong>injection</strong>.</li>
<li>It <strong>induces a strong systemic immune response</strong>, thus protecting against paralytic poliomyelitis, <strong>without any risk of causing VAPP or VDPV</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Its downside</strong> is that it hardly elicits mucosal immunity and is thus <strong>unable to prevent silent infections and transmission</strong>. So, in the event of an outbreak, only the OPV is used.</li>
<li>Also, manufacturing the IPV requires <strong>a high level of biosafety measures</strong>, because wild viruses are chemically inactivated.</li>
<li>As a result, most economically developing countries are unable to produce it locally and are <strong>forced to import it from richer countries.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A global switch to tackle the disadvantages of both vaccines:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>90% of VAPP and VDPV</strong> cases have been due to poliovirus type 2 and this virus was eradicated worldwide in 1999.</li>
<li>As a result, the <strong>OPV has attenuated versions of types 1 and 3</strong> of the viruses (since April 2016).</li>
<li>This was accompanied by the <strong>introduction of IPV</strong> in countries that still depended on OPV in their national immunisation programmes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Risks associated with this global switch:</strong> The number of VDPV cases increased after April 2016 – the cases in the US, UK and Israel were all VDPVs</p>
<p><strong>Why did the global switch fail?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Limited supply/ availability of the IPV due to a sudden increase in the demand for IPV after the switch</li>
<li>Cost/ logistics</li>
<li>As the new OPV lacked the type-2 poliovirus, <strong>the population immunity against the type-2 virus dropped</strong>, giving the virus a new lease of life.</li>
<li><strong>The interruption in routine immunisation</strong> during COVID-19 also played a part in increasing the fraction of unvaccinated and/or under-vaccinated individuals.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How can OPV help?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A child vaccinated with only the IPV will resist the virus’s ability to cause a paralytic disease, <strong>but will still be at risk of being infected</strong>, contributing to silent transmission of both vaccine-derived and wild polioviruses.</li>
<li><strong>Hence, it would be dangerous and unethical to discontinue OPV in a hasty manner.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The success story of India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The polio vaccination programme</strong> has successfully reduced the prevalence of polio cases by 99.9% worldwide since it was launched in 1988.</li>
<li><strong>On 13 January 2023, India completed 12 polio-free years</strong> – a remarkable achievement that was made as a result of consistent, determined efforts and genuine commitment at all levels.</li>
<li>Since the transmission of wild poliovirus is rampant in India’s neighbouring countries (mainly Pakistan), it has persisted with <strong>pulse polio rounds</strong> that administer OPV.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New alternatives:</strong> Efforts are on to develop better polio vaccines to tackle the disadvantages of both the OPV and the IPV. For example, <strong>a novel OPV (nOPV)</strong> has recently been used in African countries.</li>
<li><strong>nOPV:</strong> It is manufactured using attenuated polioviruses in which certain mutations have been introduced using genetic engineering, making it five times harder for the virus to regain its neurovirulence.</li>
<li><strong>Make IPV manufacturing safer</strong>: Researchers are trying to use attenuated viruses instead of wild viruses.</li>
<li><strong>Testing specific adjuvants:</strong> That can be added to the IPV to induce a mucosal immune response.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The OPV is a champion that has succeeded in bringing the world to the brink of eradication of a dreaded disease. Until a better effective solution is available, it would be inadvisable to skip the OPV.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Forest Conservation (Amendment) Bill 2023 is expected to be tabled for clearance during the monsoon parliament session that began on July 20, 2023.</p>
<p><strong>The Forest (Conservation) Act 1980:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It was enacted to ensure that <strong>India’s forest land is not willingly usurped for non-forestry purposes.</strong></li>
<li>The Act empowers the Centre to require that any forest land diverted for non-forestry purposes be <strong>duly compensated.</strong></li>
<li>it broadens its purview <strong>to include territory that is not formally designated as “forest”</strong> in State or Central government records.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Need for the latest amendments:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This forest-clearance approval is one of the <strong>most difficult permits to obtain in India</strong>, requiring a wait of as long as 365 days and lakhs of rupees in bribes.</li>
<li><strong>India’s land records are in terrible shape</strong>, parcels marked as forests in one official record can be given a different classification in another.</li>
<li>To make matters worse, <strong>the court order was worded</strong> such that it led states to avoid reclassifying forests.</li>
<li>According to the Centre, these amendments are necessary <strong>to remove ambiguities and bring clarity about the applicability of the Act on various lands</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Some of the proposed amendments:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cultivating plantations on non-forest land</strong> that could (over time) increase tree cover.</li>
<li><strong>Removing the (1980 Act’s) restrictions</strong> on creating infrastructure that would aid national security and create livelihood opportunities for those living on the periphery of forests. <strong>For example,</strong><ul>
<li><strong>In geographically sensitive areas</strong> within 100 km of the International Borders or the Line of Control, no forest clearance is required to construct highways, hydel power projects, etc.</li>
<li>No forest clearance is required to establish <strong>zoos, safari parks and ecotourism activities.</strong></li>
<li><strong>No central protection for vast tracts of so-called ‘deemed forests’</strong> (forests not officially recorded as forests) and permitting activities such as tourism.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Concerns raised by the environmentalists:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amending the name of the Act:</strong> To Van (Sanrakshan Evam Samvardhan) Adhiniyam (translated as Forest Conservation and Augmentation) from the existing Forest (Conservation) Act.</li>
<li><strong>The reclassification of forest areas adds confusion:</strong><ul>
<li>The Bill states that the FCA will only apply to areas recorded as forests in government records, as on or after <strong>25 October 1980.</strong></li>
<li>This has raised fears that the amendment will <strong>invalidate the SC’s 1996 judgment in T.N. Godavarman vs Union of India,</strong> which expanded the purview of the FCA by interpreting the meaning of forest as its dictionary definition.</li>
<li><strong>If these areas are declassified</strong>, 1,97,159 sq km of forests (<strong>27.</strong><strong>62%</strong> of total 7,13,789 sq km) that lie outside Recorded Forest Areas will lose all protection.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Framed without taking real scenario into consideration:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Only 21%</strong> of India’s land area has forests and <strong>only 12.37%</strong> of this is intact natural forest.</li>
<li>While the <strong>India State of Forest Report 2021</strong> has shown a marginal increase (2261 sq. km) in forest cover, <strong>it hides a pattern of deforestation in some parts of the country</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>For instance</strong>, the most biodiversity-rich <strong>north-eastern hill States show</strong> a net decline of 3199 sq. km of forest cover from 2009-2019.</li>
<li>Also<strong>,</strong> this marginal increase in forest cover can be ascribed to commercial plantations, which <strong>can’t replace the ecological functions performed by intact natural forests.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Exemptions will remove the necessity of forest clearances:</strong><ul>
<li>In border areas, which are home to the most ecologically important ecosystems in the country.</li>
<li><strong>This will be in conflict with the rights of forest-dwelling tribes</strong>, as they will no longer be consulted before seeking forest clearances.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Bill was referred to a joint committee (JPC) instead of the standing committee</strong>: The 31-member joint committee (18 are from the ruling party) has 21 members from the Lok Sabha and 10 from the Rajya Sabha.<ul>
<li>The JPC has not suggested any changes in the original version of the Bill.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Government’s intention:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>This is a rare opportunity for India to correct a 27-year-old policy logjam</strong> that is holding up growth and employment opportunities, without helping the country substantially conserve its forests.</li>
<li><strong>The changes are necessary</strong> considering the dynamic changes in the ecological, strategic and economic aspirations of the country.</li>
<li><strong>The amendments will</strong> –<ul>
<li>Support the country’s objective to increase forest and tree cover up to a third of its land area.</li>
<li>Help the country <strong>achieve Net Zero emissions by 2070</strong> and <strong>maintain or enhance forest carbon stocks</strong> through ecologically balanced sustainable development.</li>
<li>Help <strong>create a carbon sink</strong> amounting to 2.5-3 billion tonnes of CO2-equivalent by 2030 under the <strong>Nationally Determined Contribution targets.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The scope of this act can be further expanded</strong> with emerging ecological challenges of forest conservation, restoration, compensatory mechanism, mitigation measures, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Bill should not be tabled in Parliament <strong>without additional consultations with domain experts</strong>.</li>
<li>As the devastating impacts of climate change and environmental degradation become clearer (recent floods across north India), <strong>this is the time for the government to reaffirm its commitment</strong> to protecting the country’s immense biodiversity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While ensuring the military security of the country is a priority, the Bill should not come at the cost of losing ecological security.</li>
<li>These natural ecosystems play a crucial role in buffering against increasingly unpredictable weather patterns caused by climate change.</li>

<h4 id="content-for-mains-enrichment"><strong>Content for Mains Enrichment</strong></h4>
<p>Following a <strong>challenging defeat in the 2010 French Open, Novak Djokovic</strong>, a renowned tennis grand slam winner <strong>ranked No. 3 globally</strong>, contemplated <strong>quitting tennis</strong>. Overwhelmed by the <strong>pressures of rankings and external expectations</strong>, he confided in his coach, Marián Vajda.</p>
<p>In response, Vajda posed a crucial question to Djokovic: <strong>Why did he start playing tennis in the first place?</strong></p>
<p>Reflecting on his early memories, Djokovic realized his love for a <strong>mini tennis racket and soft foam ball,</strong> which ignited his passion for the sport.</p>
<p>Encouraged by Vajda, <strong>Djokovic chose to prioritize the joy of playing over external demands.</strong></p>
<p>From that moment on, <strong>he embraced the sheer pleasure of playing for its own sake.</strong> The subsequent season <strong>witnessed Djokovic’s remarkable transformation</strong>. He achieved one of the <strong>greatest seasons in sports history, securing 43 consecutive victories</strong>, claiming three Grand Slam titles, including his <strong>first Wimbledon win, and culminating as the world’s top-ranked player.</strong></p>
<p>By reconnecting with his genuine passion for tennis, Djokovic played with newfound freedom, rediscovering the pure joy of being a carefree kid on the court. This inner connection paved the way for his phenomenal success.</p>
<p><strong>Learnings from his life</strong>: Balancing Ambition with Enjoyment, Embracing a Playful Mindset, Being True to Yourself, Focusing on Intrinsic Rewards, Authenticity and Self-Awareness and Passion and Love for the thing you are doing.</p>
<p><strong>Usage</strong>: You can use the story for the essay as well as in the examples of ethics.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The <strong>India Meteorological Department (IMD)</strong> has recently introduced the Heat Index on an <strong>experimental basis</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Heat Index is designed to <strong>offer general guidance for regions in India where the apparent temperature, also known as the “feel-like” temperature</strong>, is higher due to a <strong>combination of heat and humidity</strong>, causing discomfort for people.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Heat Index is calculated using an <strong>equation similar to the one used by the National Weather Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the USA</strong>. It takes into account the impact of humidity on high temperatures to provide a more accurate representation of how the weather feels to humans, indicating the level of discomfort.</p>
<p><strong>The Heat Index is categorized into colour codes for easy interpretation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Green: Experimental Heat Index below 35°C</li>
<li>Yellow: Experimental Heat Index in the range of 36-45°C</li>
<li>Orange: Experimental Heat Index in the range of 46-55°C</li>
<li>Red: Experimental Heat Index above 55°C</li>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/electron-rains-on-mercury-cause-x-ray-auroras-finds-bepicolombo-during-close-flyby-8848269/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: Recent observations by the <strong>BepiColombo mission by ESA and JAXA</strong> provided valuable insights into <strong>auroras on Mercury.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>On Mercury, <strong>auroras are caused by electrons from solar wind directly interacting with its surface</strong>.</li>
<li>During the mission’s close Mercury flyby, the spacecraft observed the <strong>planet’s magnetosphere, the region influenced by its magnetic field.</strong> The magnetosphere was found to be <strong>unusually compressed, likely due to the high pressure from the solar wind.</strong></li>
<li>The “dawn side” of Mercury’s magnetosphere appeared to <strong>accelerate high-energy electrons that eventually fell onto the planet’s surface</strong>. Since Mercury lacks a substantial atmosphere to hinder their progress, these electrons interact with the surface material, emitting X-ray auroras.</li>
</ul>
<p>It <strong>confirms that the mechanism generating auroras on Mercury is similar to that found throughout the Solar System</strong>. It sheds light on the process of X-ray auroras on the planet, <strong>a significant step in understanding the interactions between the solar wind and planetary surfaces.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What are Auroras?</strong></p>
<p>Auroras are <strong>natural light displays that occur in the Earth’s polar regions</strong>, mainly near the <strong>Arctic and Antarctic circles</strong>. They are caused by <strong>charged particles from the sun colliding with the Earth’s atmosphere.</strong> The Northern Lights (Aurora Borealis) occur near the North Pole, while the Southern Lights (Aurora Australis) occur near the South Pole.</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has permitted mutual funds to introduce <strong>five new categories under the ESG</strong> (environmental, social, and governance) scheme.</p>
<ul>
<li>Currently, mutual funds can launch only one ESG scheme under the thematic category of equity schemes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is ESG Scheme?</strong></p>
<p>ESG aims to <strong>encourage sustainable and ethical business practices</strong>, including climate change, pollution, human rights, corporate governance, and more. SEBI issued a guidance <strong>note in 2012, urging companies listed on Indian Stock Exchanges</strong> to disclose their ESG performance in annual reports.</p>
<ul>
<li>With effect from the <strong>financial year 2022-2023, filing of Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR</strong>) has been made mandatory for the <strong>top 1000</strong> listed companies by SEBI.</li>
<li>ESG schemes are <strong>mandated to invest at least 65% of assets</strong> in listed entities with BRSR Core assurance, while the balance can be invested in companies with BRSR disclosures, starting from October 1, 2024.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How ESG differs from</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/10/30/corporate-social-responsibility/#:~:text=What%20is%20Corporate%20Social%20Responsibility,corporation's%20business%20model%20and%20culture."><strong>corporate social responsibility (CSR)</strong></a><strong>?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>India has a robust CSR policy codified in the Companies Act 2013, mandating that corporations engage in initiatives that contribute to the welfare of society by <strong>spending at least 2% of their net profit over the preceding 3 years on CSR activities.</strong></li>
<li>ESG regulations <strong>differ in process and impact</strong>. For example, The U.K. Modern Slavery Act requires companies to publish the efforts they have taken to identify the risks of child labour in their supply chain, etc.</li>
