<p><strong>Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLEDs) are used to create a digital display in many devices. What are the advantages of OLED displays over Liquid Crystal displays? ( USPC 2017)</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>OLED displays can be fabricated on flexible plastic substrates.</li>
<li>Roll-up displays embedded in clothing can be made using OLEDs.</li>
<li>Transparent displays are possible using OLEDs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Select the correct answer using the codes given below:</p>
<p>(a) 1 and 3 only</p>
<p>(b) 2 only</p>
<p>(c) 1, 2 and 3</p>
<p>(d) None of the above statements is correct</p>
<p><strong>Answer: C</strong></p>
<p>OLED TV is a television display technology based on the characteristics of organic light-emitting diodes (OLED). OLED TV is a different technology than LED TV. The OLED display is based on an organic substance used as the semiconductor material in light-emitting diodes (LEDs).</p>
<p>OLEDs are ultrathin and light, they can be fabricated on flexible plastic or roll-up displays. Transparent displays are also possible.</p>
<p>In general, OLEDs are more efficient than LCDs for displaying dark images because black pixels consume little power for an emissive display, while LCDs are more efficient than OLEDs at displaying bright images.</p>

<li><strong>The National Load Despatch Center</strong> (NLDC) is required to release an annual short-term national resource adequacy plan covering one year.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The objective of the plan</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To reliably fulfil the peak demand</strong> with the help of adequate supply of generation and demand response.</li>
<li><strong>To optimise the generation of electricity</strong> at the lowest possible cost while meeting the demand. <strong>This includes minimising overall system costs</strong>, such as –<ul>
<li>Operational and maintenance expenses,</li>
<li>Fuel costs,</li>
<li>The costs associated with starting up and shutting down power-generating units, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>To take into account various constraints</strong> related to power plant operations, such as –<ul>
<li>Limits on ramping up or down generation,</li>
<li>Renewable purchase obligation (RPO) targets,</li>
<li>Capacities for solar rooftop or distributed generation, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A set of guidelines to establish <strong>an institutional mechanism</strong> for resource adequacy, spanning from the national level down to the DISCOM.</li>
<li><strong>It will ensure the availability of resources</strong> at each level to meet the demand.</li>
<li><strong>It will help proactively assess</strong> the requirements for new generation capacities, energy storage, and other flexible resources well in advance.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key challenges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The ongoing challenge of <strong>catering to the peak demand reliably</strong> is being faced by the utilities in India.</li>
<li>Infrastructural and management challenges while sharing <strong>inter-state and inter-region power</strong>.</li>
<li>Increasing share of <strong>variable renewable energy and higher frequency of extreme weather events</strong> due to climate change.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Given the limited capacity and the learning curve associated with the detailed resource adequacy plan, <strong>DISCOM be allowed a grace period of 2-3 years</strong> before implementation of the same.</li>
<li>Such a preparatory period would allow the discoms to explore the methodology, collect relevant data and <strong>put an internal institutional mechanism in place.</strong></li>

<tr>
<td><strong>About OMSS</strong></td>
<td>Under the OMSS, the <strong>FCI sells (from time to time) surplus food grains (especially wheat and rice) from the central pool in the open market to traders,</strong> bulk consumers, and retail chains, at pre-determined prices.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>How?</strong></td>
<td>Through <strong>e-­auctions</strong>, where open-market bidders can buy specified quantities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>OMSS and States</strong></td>
<td>States are also allowed to procure food grains (over and above what they get from the central pool to distribute to NFSA beneficiaries) through the OMSS <strong>without participating in the auctions</strong>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Objective of OMSS</strong></td>
<td><strong>Ensure food security</strong> by enhancing the supply of food grains during the lean season, <strong>control inflation</strong> by moderating the open market prices, especially in the deficit regions</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Revision of OMSS</strong></td>
<td>The Centre decided to restrict the quantity that a single bidder can purchase from 3,000 metric tonnes (MT) to 10­-100 MT.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>The objective behind the revision</strong></td>
<td><strong>To accommodate more small and marginal buyers, curb retail prices as allowing smaller bids should ideally break monopolies of bulk buyers, allowing more competitive bids by small buyers.</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Impact of Revision on States</strong></td>
<td>The Centre stopped the sale of rice and wheat from the Central pool under the OMSS to State governments, also disallowing private bidders to sell their OMSS supplies to state governments.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Steps Taken by States</strong></td>
<td>Considering <strong>alternative methods</strong> of obtaining wheat and rice. <strong>For example,</strong> TN is trying to purchase rice from government agencies other than FCI.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Allegations of States</strong></td>
<td>States such as Karnataka (which runs the Anna Bhagya scheme) and Tamil Nadu (which runs the universal PDS) have criticised the government for engaging in “politics” at the expense of marginalised beneficiaries of State welfare schemes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Centre’s reply</strong></td>
<td><strong>Restrictions are imposed to curb inflation and regulate supply. The Centre is already distributing grains to 80 crore marginalised beneficiaries under the NFSA.</strong></td>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Scientists have <strong>found evidence suggesting the presence of a continuous background of gravitational waves</strong> in the universe.</p>
<p><strong>About Gravitational Waves:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Gravitational waves are <strong>disturbances in the fabric of spacetime</strong> caused by the <strong>movement of large objects, such as the collision of two black holes</strong>.</li>
<li>The waves were first <strong>detected in 2015</strong>, but this new research indicates that <strong>multiple gravitational waves constantly deform and reshape spacetime</strong>, influencing the motion of celestial bodies.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Findings:</strong></p>
<p>Scientists have <strong>discovered a ‘background hum’ rumbling throughout the universe</strong>. It confirms the <strong>presence of low-frequency (long-wavelengths) gravitational waves</strong>, thought to be constantly rolling through space noise.</p>
<p>India’s <strong>Giant Metre wave Radio Telescope (GMRT, Pune</strong>) was among the world’s six large telescopes that played a vital role in providing evidence. <strong>The other 5 are located in Germany, the UK, France, Italy and the Netherlands.</strong></p>
