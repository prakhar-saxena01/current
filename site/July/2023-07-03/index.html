<p><strong>Syllabus: Colonization and Decolonization</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/netherlands-apology-slavery-history-explained-8697553/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: The Netherlands has <strong>issued an apology for its historical</strong> involvement in slavery, <strong>marking the 150th anniversary of its abolishment in Suriname and Dutch colonies</strong> in the Caribbean.</p>
<p><strong>The acknowledgement:</strong></p>
<p>Dutch King Willem-Alexander and Prime Minister Mark Rutte acknowledged the country’s role in the <strong>transatlantic slave trade and expressed remorse for the atrocities committed</strong> against enslaved people and their descendants.</p>
<ul>
<li>The government has committed to raising awareness, <strong>addressing the present-day effects of slavery, and incorporating its history into education</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Counterview:</strong></p>
<p>However, some critics argue that the apology falls short and has called for <strong>reparations and greater recognition of modern-day racism and discrimination.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ethical Viewpoint:</strong></p>
<p>The Netherlands’ acknowledgement of its colonial history, including slavery, reflects an <strong>ethical standpoint of taking responsibility for past wrongdoings</strong>. By apologizing and seeking forgiveness, the Dutch aim to address the <strong>moral implications of their actions and promote reconciliation and justice</strong>. This acknowledgement also highlights the importance of <strong>recognizing historical injustices and working towards creating</strong> a more equitable and inclusive society.</p>
<p><strong>What was Slave Trade?</strong></p>
<p>The slave trade between colonies refers to the <strong>transportation and trading of enslaved African individuals from Africa to European colonies</strong>, primarily during the era of European colonialism.</p>
<p>The slave trade <strong>was driven by economic interests and resulted in the exploitation, suffering, and loss of millions</strong> of African lives.</p>

<p><strong>History of Dutch Colonialism in India</strong></p>
<p>Dutch colonialism in India was characterized by the <strong>presence of the Dutch East India Company</strong>, which established trading posts and factories in various parts of India, including the <strong>Coromandel Coast, Bengal, and Surat (1620s)</strong>. The first factory founded by Dutch in India was at <strong>Masulipatnam</strong> in 1605. Their primary focus was on trade, particularly in textiles, spices, and other commodities. They also conquered <strong>Sri Lanka from the Portuguese and built forts</strong> along the Malabar coast. However, their influence in India declined in the <strong>18th century due to the growing power</strong> of the British East India Company. <strong>The Battle of Colachel in 1741</strong> marked the end of the Dutch presence in South India. Eventually, through the Anglo-Dutch treaties (1812 and 1824), the Dutch lost most of their trading posts in India, further diminishing their colonial presence in the country.</p>
<p><strong>Danish Occupation of A&amp;N Islands</strong>:</p>
<p>Settlers from the <strong>Danish East India Company</strong> arrived in the Nicobar Islands on 12 December 1755. <strong>Denmark’s presence</strong> in the territory ended formally on 16 October 1868 when it sold the rights to the Nicobar Islands to Britain, which made them part of British India in 1869.</p>

<p><strong>Other suggestions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>State Funding of Elections</strong>: Committees on electoral reforms, such as the Dinesh Goswami and Inderjeet Committee, recommend state funding of elections to reduce the use of black money and limit the criminalization of politics.</li>
<li><strong>Strengthening Election Commission</strong></li>
<li>Voters need to <strong>remain vigilant and report any misuse of money</strong>, gifts, or inducements during elections.</li>
<li><strong>Proactive Role of the Judiciary:</strong> Fast-tracking the judicial process can help eliminate corruption and criminal elements from the political system. It <strong>requires a time-bound justice delivery</strong> system, stronger actions by the Election Commission, and necessary amendments to relevant laws.</li>
<li>Amending the Representation of Peoples Act (RPA) of 1951 to <strong>disqualify individuals with pending serious criminal charges from contesting elections.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>:</p>
<p>The criminalization of politics poses a serious threat to democracy and good governance. It undermines the principles of free and fair elections, affects the integrity of public servants, causes social disharmony, and erodes public trust in the government. Addressing this issue is crucial for the health and functioning of democratic systems.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> India’s rise as a global player is inevitably linked to the kind of partnership it enjoys with Africa.</p>
<p><strong>India-Africa ties – Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>India enjoys <strong>historical, political, economic, and cultural connections</strong> with the African continent for a long back.</li>
<li>India’s links with the struggle for freedom and justice in South Africa date back to the period during which <strong>Mahatma Gandhi started his Satyagraha movement in South Africa.</strong></li>
<li>India worked consistently to put the issue of apartheid on the agenda of the <strong>UN, NAM and other multilateral organisations.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>India-Africa ties – Current Status:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Ind_Afrca.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Ind_Afrca.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>India’s Technical and Economic Cooperation Programme (ITEC)</strong> has been a useful medium for promoting cooperation in the development of human resources.</li>
<li>In the past 15 years and especially since 2014, India-Africa relations have developed steadily <strong>but more progress is achievable</strong>.</li>
<li>In this context, the <strong>Africa Expert Group</strong> (AEG) – established by the Vivekananda International Foundation, presented the <strong>‘India-Africa Partnership: Achievements, Challenges and Roadmap 2030</strong>’.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Highlights of the India-Africa Partnership (Achievements, Challenges and Roadmap 2030):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transitions unfolding in Africa:</strong> It is slowly heading toward <strong>regional integration and is devoted to democracy</strong>, peace and progress, even as countries (like Ethiopia, and Sudan) continue to battle insurgency, ethnic violence and terrorism.</li>
<li><strong>Sharpening competition among external powers:</strong> Countries such as China, the US, Japan, Türkiye, and UAE are competing for strengthening their relations with Africa to ensure –<ul>
<li>Market access,</li>
<li>Gain energy and mineral security, and</li>
<li>Increase political and economic influence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges for India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No clear Strategy/Vision</li>
<li>Africa is not the prime focus of India</li>
<li><strong>Competing powers in Africa:</strong> For example, China enjoys consistent and robust relations with the continent since 2000 and is currently its biggest economic partner.<ul>
<li>China’s role in Africa is recognised as <strong>‘the infrastructure developer’, ‘the resource provider’, and ‘the financier.</strong>’</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations to strengthen India-Africa ties:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Political and diplomatic cooperation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It should be strengthened by <strong>restoring periodic leaders’ summits</strong> through the medium of the <strong>India-Africa Forum Summit</strong> (not held since 2015).</li>
<li><strong>A new annual strategic dialogue</strong> between the chairperson of the African Union (AU) and India’s External Affairs Minister should be launched in 2023.</li>
<li><strong>Forging consensus among G-20 members</strong> on the AU’s entry into the G-20 as a full member.</li>
<li>The MEA <strong>should have a secretary exclusively in charge of African affairs</strong> to further enhance the implementation and impact of the African policy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Defence and security cooperation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The government needs to <strong>increase the number of defence missions deployed in Africa</strong>, widen the footprint of maritime collaboration, and expand lines of credit to facilitate defence exports.</li>
<li>More can be done to enhance cooperation on security and defence issues like <strong>counter-terrorism, cyber security and emerging technologies.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Economic and development cooperation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>India-Africa trade of <strong>$98 billion in FY22–23</strong> can go up if access to finance through the creation of an Africa Growth Fund (AGF) is ensured.</li>
<li><strong>A special package of measures</strong> –<ul>
<li>To improve project exports and build up cooperation in the <strong>shipping domain</strong> has been suggested.</li>
<li>To promote trilateral cooperation and deepen S&amp;T cooperation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Socio-cultural cooperation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It should be increased through <strong>greater interaction</strong> between universities, think tanks, civil society and media organisations in India and select African countries.</li>
<li><strong>Setting up a National Centre for African Studies</strong> will be the right step.</li>
<li><strong>ITEC and Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) scholarships</strong> awarded to Africans should be named after famous African figures.</li>
<li><strong>Visa measures</strong> for African students should be liberalised and should also be given work visas for short periods.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>To cater to the needs of a large continent like Africa, India must build partnerships with other countries along the lines of the <strong>Asia-Africa Growth Corridor –</strong> an economic cooperation agreement between India, Japan and multiple African countries.</li>
<li>India has a substantive partnership with Africa and a rich fund of <strong>goodwill</strong>, but it is essential for New Delhi to review its Africa policy periodically and <strong>place a razor-like focus on its implementation.</strong></li>

<tr>
<td><strong>What is Santhal Rebellion?</strong></td>
<td>Santhal rebellion (also known as ‘Hul’) (1855-1856) was a revolt against both the British East India Company and the zamindari system by the Santhal. The rebellion was led by the <strong>four sibling Brothers – Sidhu, Kanhu, Chand and Bhairav.</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Santhals and their Migration</strong></td>
<td>The Santhal people migrated from the <strong>Birbhum and Manbhum regions of Bengal to modern-day Santhal Pargana</strong>. The British relocated them to the forested area of <strong>Damin-i-Koh</strong> as part of their revenue collection strategy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Reasons behind the Hul</strong></td>
<td>The Santhals rebelled against the British <strong>due to extortions, oppressive extractions, dispossession of property, false measurements, and other illegalities.</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Organization of the Hul</strong></td>
<td>Contrary to popular belief, the Hul was a <strong>well-planned and organized political war.</strong> Preparations included <strong>guerrilla formations, military teams, detectives, secret bases,</strong> logistics, and a network of message carriers for coordination. <strong>Non-Adivasi Hindu castes</strong> also participated in the rebellion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Contribution of Women</strong></td>
<td><strong>Phulo-Jhano</strong>, two sisters, led an army of 1,000 women who played crucial roles in the rebellion. The East India Company’s army was defeated twice during the uprising.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>End</strong></td>
<td>After the rebellion started, <strong>martial law was proclaimed</strong> by the East India Company which lasted until January 3, 1856, when martial law was suspended and the rebellion was <strong>eventually suppressed by the Presidency armies.</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Lasting Impact of the Hul</strong></td>
<td>The Santhal rebellion <strong>inspired future uprisings, such as the Santhal involvement in the 1857 mutiny.</strong> It <strong>symbolized resistance against British</strong> colonialism and laid the foundation for subsequent movements in Jharkhand.</td>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/world/wmo-revives-ozone-uv-bulletin-after-7-years-shows-steady-recovery-of-ozone-layer-90322"><strong>DTE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>:  World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has released a bulletin (after 7 years gap) indicating a <strong>steady recovery of the ozone layer</strong>, particularly over the Antarctic region.</p>
<p><strong>About Ozone Layer:</strong></p>
<p>The ozone layer or <strong>ozone shield is a region of Earth’s stratosphere</strong> that absorbs most of the Sun’s ultraviolet radiation. It contains a high concentration of ozone (O3) in relation to other parts of the atmosphere, although still small in relation to other gases in the lower part of the stratosphere (15-35 Km above the surface of the earth)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/atmospher.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/atmospher.jpg?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Key findings</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Montreal Protocol and its amendments</strong> are successful in <strong>eliminating up to 99%</strong> of Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS) (long-lived man-made chemicals which destroy the protective ozone layer)</li>
<li><strong>It highlights the impact of climate change</strong>, which is slowing down the recovery process and affecting the lower atmosphere’s climate.</li>
<li><strong>The eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano (in the southern Pacific) in January 2022</strong> increased water vapour content in the stratosphere, leading to reduced ozone in the lower stratosphere of the southern hemisphere.</li>
<li>This additional water vapour is expected to result in more <strong>polar stratospheric clouds, enhanced ozone depletion, and larger and longer-lasting “ozone holes”</strong> in the future.</li>
<li>It highlights the <strong>importance of monitoring and protecting the ozone layer</strong> due to its crucial role in shielding life on Earth from harmful solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation.</li>

<p>Both India and China have ramped up infrastructure development on the north bank of <strong>Pangong Tso Lake in eastern Ladakh</strong> and western Tibet. China is constructing a bridge to connect the north and south banks of the lake, while India is building a <strong>black-topped road</strong> on its side of the north bank.</p>
<p>The ongoing tensions between the two sides have led to <strong>gridlock in Corps Commander-level talks, with remaining friction points at Depsang and Demchok</strong>.</p>
<p>Pangong Tso is an <strong>endorheic lake</strong> (bodies of water that do not flow into an ocean or a sea) <strong>spanning</strong> eastern Ladakh and West Tibet situated at an elevation of 4,225 m. It is 134 km long and divided into five sub-lakes. It is the <strong>world’s highest saltwater lake</strong>. Its water, which seems to be dyed in blue, stands in stark contrast to the arid mountains surrounding it. One-third of the Pangong Lake lies in India and the other two-thirds in China.</p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-2_2"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Issues &amp; Challenges Pertaining to the Federal Structure</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/the-governors-move-is-dangerous-unconstitutional/article67028093.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Governor of Tamil Nadu (RN Ravi) has dismissed a Minister (V. Senthilbalaji) in the Council of Ministers of TN and later backtracked on his decision keeping the dismissal order in abeyance.</p>
<p><strong>About the minister and his dismissal:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The minister was facing serious criminal proceedings in a number of cases of corruption and was arrested by the ED earlier.</li>
<li>He was dismissed on the pretext that <strong>he will adversely impact the due process of law,</strong> including a fair investigation <strong>that may eventually lead to the breakdown of the Constitutional machinery in the State.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Criticism of this unprecedented act of the governor:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Dismissing a Minister of a government which <strong>enjoys an absolute majority</strong> in the State legislature, <strong>without the recommendation of the Chief Minister</strong> of the State, is going to set a dangerous precedent.</li>
<li>It has the <strong>potential to destabilise State governments putting the federal and whole constitutional systems</strong> in danger.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Power of the Governor to dismiss a minister:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>The Government of India Act 1935: The appointment, summoning,</strong> determination of their salaries and the <strong>dismissal of Ministers</strong> shall be exercised by the Governor at his discretion.</p>
<p><strong>What does the Indian Constitution say?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>According to Article 164 of the Constitution</strong>, the CM is appointed by the Governor (without any advice from anyone) and the individual Ministers are appointed by the Governor only on the advice of the CM.</li>
<li>This implies that the <strong>Governor cannot appoint an individual Minister according to his discretion</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>So the Governor can dismiss a Minister only on the advice of the CM.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The reason is simple:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The CM alone has the <strong>discretion to choose his Ministers</strong>. He also decides who will not remain as a Minister in his Council.<ul>
<li>This is <strong>a political decision</strong> of the CM, who is ultimately <strong>answerable to the people</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Governor is a mere constitutional head</strong> and there is no executive function which a Governor can perform independently under the Constitution. (BR Ambedkar)<ul>
<li><strong>Article 163:</strong> A Council of Ministers (led by the CM) shall assist and advise the Governor in the discharge of his duties, except when the Governor is compelled to exercise his discretion under this Constitution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The pleasure doctrine is a formal act:</strong> This has been <strong>brought into the Constitution of India from the Government of India Act 1935</strong>.<ul>
<li>But these words simply refer to issuing the order of dismissal (by the Governor), but <strong>only on the advice of the CM</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Judicial clarification:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In Shamsher Singh vs State Of Punjab (1974)</strong>, the SC declared the President and Governor as the custodians of all executive powers, who exercise these powers in accordance with the advice of their Ministers (except in exceptional situations).</li>
<li><strong>In Nabam Rebia vs Deputy Speaker (2017)</strong>, the SC reaffirmed the law laid down in Shamsher Singh and the discretionary powers of the Governor are limited to the postulates of Article 163(1).<ul>
<li>The Court also set aside the decisions in the <strong>Mahabir Prasad Sharma (1968) and Pratapsing Raojirao Rane (1999) cases</strong>, where it was held that the Governor can exercise power under Article 164 in an unfettered manner.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> In sum, the dismissal of a Minister of the TN Government by the Governor of the State without the advice of the Chief Minister is <strong>constitutionally wrong</strong>.</p>
