<h4 id="gs-paper-2"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Government policies and interventions for development in various sectors and issues arising out of their design and implementation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/what-is-the-dna-bill-8857810/#:~:text=What%20are%20the%20objections%20against%20the%20Bill%3F,of%20the%20individual%20is%20protected."><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Union government withdrew the DNA Technology (Use and Application) Regulation Bill 2019 from the Lok Sabha.</p>
<p><strong>What is DNA technology?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DNA/Deoxyribonucleic acid is the genetic material</strong> of the cell and contains all of the instructions for cells to carry out their structure and function.</li>
<li>DNA technology is the <strong>study and manipulation of genetic material,</strong> which includes sequencing, analysis, and cutting-and-pasting of DNA.</li>
<li>Using this technology, <strong>scientists are able to manipulate DNA</strong> to study the biology of living organisms and to improve human life (treatment of diseases).</li>
<li>However, the technology can be abused through <strong>unauthorised access to databanks and unauthorised disclosure of information.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Background of the Bill:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First proposed in 2003</strong> (by the Ministry of S&amp;T), the Bill has gone through numerous changes, led by both the Department of Biotechnology and the Law Ministry, over the years.</li>
<li><strong>In 2019</strong>, it was referred to the <strong>Parliamentary Standing Committee</strong> on S&amp;T after being introduced in the Lok Sabha.</li>
<li><strong>In 2021</strong>, the panel’s report was released, which highlighted that <strong>the Bill could be misused to target segments of society</strong> based on religion, caste or political views.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About the DNA Technology (Use and Application) Regulation Bill:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It seeks to create a regulatory framework</strong> for obtaining, storing and testing DNA samples of human beings –<ul>
<li><strong>Mainly for the purposes of criminal investigations</strong>, and</li>
<li>With the objective of establishing the identity of a person.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The proposed law seeks to bring in a supervisory structure</strong> –<ul>
<li>To oversee practices (already used in criminal investigations, establishment of parentage, and search for missing people), and</li>
<li>Frame guidelines and rules so that the DNA technology is not misused.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It also specifies –<ul>
<li>The <strong>circumstances under which a person can be asked to submit DNA samples</strong>,</li>
<li>The purposes for which such requests can be made, and</li>
<li>The exact procedure for handling, storing and accessing these samples.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Bill proposes to set up institutional structures:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>At the national level,</strong><ul>
<li><strong>DNA regulatory board:</strong> The board is proposed to be the main regulatory authority and would frame the rules and guidelines for DNA collection, testing and storage.</li>
<li><strong>DNA data bank:</strong> It would be the repository of all DNA samples collected from various people under specified rules.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Regional centres</strong> of the board as well as the data bank can be set up at the state level too.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Powers of the DNA regulatory board:</strong> The testing of DNA samples can be carried out only at laboratories that are authorised to do so by the regulatory board.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DNA_tec.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DNA_tec.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Objections against the Bill:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Three issues</strong> – whether DNA technology is foolproof, whether the provisions adequately address the possibility of abuse of DNA information, and whether the privacy of the individual is protected.</li>
<li><strong>DNA information can be extremely revelatory</strong> and collecting and storing such intrusive information could lead to <strong>abuse and violation of a person’s privacy</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The government’s argument:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nearly 60 countries have enacted similar legislation</strong> and all important matters related to privacy, confidentiality and data protection have been taken into account.</li>
<li><strong>Very limited information is proposed to be stored</strong> in the indices, which can tell nothing about the individual and only act as a unique identifier.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why is Bill withdrawn?</strong></p>
<p>As per reports, most of the provisions of the Bill were broadly covered in the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/05/05/sansad-tv-perspective-the-criminal-procedure-identification-bill-2022-unmasking-criminals/">Criminal Procedure (Identification) Act 2022</a> brought by the Ministry of Home Affairs.</p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-2_1"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Mechanisms, Laws, Institutions and Bodies constituted for the Protection and Betterment of these Vulnerable Sections</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/manipur-naked-parade-video-manipur-violence-ncw-dcw-women-commissions-in-india-8858184/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The cases of molestation and rape of women in Manipur have brought the functioning of Women’s commissions in India into focus.</p>
<p><strong>National Commission for Women (NCW):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is a <strong>statutory body o</strong>f the Government of India that was founded on <strong>January 31, 1992</strong>, by <strong>the National Commission for Women Act, 1990.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Its mandate is to:</strong><ul>
<li>Review the Constitutional and Legal safeguards for women;</li>
<li>Recommend remedial legislative measures;</li>
<li>Facilitate redressal of grievances and</li>
<li>Advise the Government on all policy matters affecting women.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Functions:</strong><ul>
<li>Investigate and examine all issues concerning the protection provided to women under the Constitution and other legislation.</li>
<li>Report on the effectiveness of those safeguards to the Central Government.</li>
<li>Make recommendations in such reports for the effective application of those protections.</li>
<li>Propose corrective legislative actions to address any flaws in laws.</li>
<li>Investigate complaints and <strong>take suo moto action</strong> in cases involving the denial of women’s rights.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Manipur State Commission for Women (MSCW):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Each state also has its own commission</strong> and MSCW was constituted in <strong>2006</strong> as a statutory body under the Manipur State Commission for Women Act, 2006.</li>
<li><strong>It is mandated to safeguard the interests of women</strong> with a wide mandate that covers all aspects of women’s development.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Major Issues around the Working of Women Commission:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Financial assistance</strong> provided to the Commissions is extremely less to cater to its needs.</li>
<li><strong>Their members are appointed by the government</strong> and therefore lack the independence to work without the influence of the government.</li>
<li><strong>They lack concrete legislative power</strong>. <strong>For example,</strong> its reports are only recommendatory.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implications of the above:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>These commissions at the national and state levels have become <strong>toothless tigers</strong>, failing to prioritise field visits over paperwork.</li>
<li>Most of the commissions are <strong>afraid to criticise the governments.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Case of Manipur:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The NCW had received a large number of complaints</strong> about the violation of women’s rights in the state.</li>
<li><strong>The NCW forwarded them to the state</strong>. The state police or its other wings probably ignored the forwards or did not have time to do justice to each of them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Commissions need to be strengthened</strong> (either by giving them Constitutional status or by amending their parent laws) so that they can concentrate on providing physical, emotional, legal and psychological aid to women in distress.</li>
<li><strong>Advertising the posts of chairpersons and members of these commissions</strong>.</li>
<li>Genuinely interested and capable individuals would then be selected by a <strong>selection committee –</strong> consisting of LoP, judges from the SC, civil society organisations, etc.</li>
<li><strong>A social audit of the performance</strong> of different commissions by competent external agencies on a regular basis would give citizens an idea of their actual work.</li>
<li><strong>There is a need for an increase of awareness and enlightenment</strong> especially required mainly among women in rural areas that such a commission exists to address their rights.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Women’s commissions in India were set up with a lot of high expectations. However, a review of their work and responses to the issues of women is the immediate need of the hour to prevent incidents like Manipur.</p>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/panel-asks-labour-ministry-to-implement-welfare-schemes-for-gig-workers-8857900/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> A parliamentary panel has asked the Ministry of Labour and Employment (MoL&amp;E) to formulate and implement welfare schemes for gig and platform workers and unorganised sector workers at the earliest.</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>Since such workers do not come under the purview of the Employees’ Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, appropriate/ specific welfare schemes for them need to be put in place by the government.</p>
<p><strong>What is a gig economy?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It is a labour market</strong> that relies heavily on temporary and part-time positions filled by independent contractors and freelancers rather than full-time permanent employees.</li>
<li><strong>Gig workers gain flexibility and independence but little or no job security.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Gig economy in India:</strong> According to the NITI Aayog estimates, <strong>nearly 23.5 million workers</strong> will be engaged in the gig economy by <strong>2029</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Issues faced by gig workers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Since the gig economy <strong>falls outside the scope of traditional, full-time employment</strong>, gig workers usually <strong>lack basic employment rights</strong> such as<ul>
<li>Minimum wages,</li>
<li>Overtime pay,</li>
<li>Medical leave, and</li>
<li>A statutorily bound resolution of employer-employee disputes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gig workers display <strong>characteristics of both employees and independent contractors</strong> → as a result fall outside the ambit of statutory benefits under –<ul>
<li>the Minimum Wages Act 1948, EPF Act 1952 and the Payment of Bonus Act 196 (for <strong>employees</strong>)</li>
<li>the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act 1970 (for <strong>contract labourers</strong>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the proposed law for gig workers?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Code on Social Security 2020</strong>, which has proposed social security schemes for gig workers and platform workers on matters relating to –<ul>
<li>life and disability cover,</li>
<li>accident insurance,</li>
<li>health and maternity benefits,</li>
<li>old age protection, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>However, the Code is yet to come into force.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other efforts:</strong></p>
<p><strong>A MoU</strong> has been signed between the MoL&amp;E and the NLSIU (Bangalore) <strong>for assistance in framing a new scheme</strong> for the gig and platform workers as well as workers in the unorganised sector.</p>
<p><strong>Concerns:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Out of the four new labour codes proposed, <strong>gig work finds reference only in the Code on Social Security</strong>.<ul>
<li>Hence, they <strong>cannot create legally recognised unions and access a national minimum wage</strong> that applies to all forms of employment.</li>
<li>They also remain <strong>excluded from accessing the specialised redressal mechanism</strong> against their employers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gig workers are excluded from the category of ‘unorganised workers’ or ‘wage workers’.</li>
<li>They also do not have the <strong>right to collective bargaining</strong> – a fundamental principle of modern labour law.</li>
<li>All the above leads to the violation of their fundamental rights under <strong>Articles 14 and 21</strong> and comes within the meaning of <strong>forced labour under Article 23.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best practices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Rajasthan Platform-Based Gig Workers (Registration and Welfare) Act 2023:</strong> Rajasthan has become the first state in the country to pass a law for the welfare of lakhs of gig workers earning their livelihood through online platforms (Ola, Swiggy, etc).</li>
<li><strong>Germany’s</strong> Temporary Employment Act provides for equal pay and equal treatment of gig workers.</li>
<li><strong>Singapore</strong> has also proposed legislative changes to extend work injury insurance and pension coverage to such workers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> A specific scheme for such workers, as recommended by the Standing Committee on Labour, Textiles, and Skill Development may resolve the above concerns.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> At a G20 Energy Ministers’ meeting, the Indian PM stated that India <strong>has rolled out 20% ethanol-blended petrol this year</strong> and aims to cover the entire <strong>country by 2025.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ethanol:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ethanol is basically <strong>9%</strong> pure alcohol that can be blended with petrol.</li>
<li>It is different from the 94% rectified spirit (having applications in paints, and pharmaceuticals) and 96% extra neutral alcohol that goes to make potable liquor.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>India’s ethanol production programme:</strong> It has come a long way in the past five years, both in terms of the quantities supplied by sugar mills/distilleries to oil marketing companies (OMCs) and the raw material used.</p>
<p><strong>Raw material used:</strong> </p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ethanol.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ethanol.jpg?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What does it mean?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>India’s ethanol programme is no longer reliant on a single feedstock or crop</strong>.</li>
<li>It has diversified only from molasses and cane to rice, maize and other grains as well.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implications of diversification of feedstocks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It will <strong>minimise supply fluctuations and price volatility</strong> on account of any one crop.</li>
<li>The incorporation of new feedstocks <strong>can create new demand for grains</strong>.<ul>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> if UP (a major sugarcane grower) and Bihar (maize) could supply rice, barley and millets to distilleries, they can “fuel India” the way Punjab, Haryana or MP “feed India”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How was this diversification made possible?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Differential pricing:</strong><ul>
<li>Till 2017-18, the OMCs were paying a uniform price for ethanol produced from any feedstocks.</li>
<li>From 2018-19, the government began fixing higher prices for ethanol produced from B-heavy molasses and whole sugarcane juice/syrup.</li>
<li><strong>This gave flexibility and incentive</strong> for mills/distilleries to use multiple feedstocks.</li>
<li><strong>This has given stimulus</strong> <strong>to ethanol production,</strong> which can be seen from its all-India average blending with petrol touching 75% in 2022-23, as against 1.6% in 2013-14.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Byproduct benefits:</strong><ul>
<li>The liquid effluent (spent wash) generated during alcohol production in distilleries can pose <strong>serious environmental problems</strong> if discharged without proper treatment.</li>
<li>The new molasses-based distilleries have MEE (multi-effect evaporator) units, where the spent wash is concentrated to about 60% solids.</li>
<li>The concentrated wash is used as <strong>a boiler fuel along with bagasse</strong> (the fibre remaining after crushing sugarcane).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>While the ethanol program has numerous benefits, there are also some concerns</strong>. Increased demand for grains for ethanol production may impact food supply and prices. Additionally, distilleries’ liquid effluent can pose environmental challenges, but advancements such as multi-effect evaporator units have enabled the utilization of spent wash as boiler fuel and the production of fertilizer and animal feed as by-products.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Overall, the ethanol program holds promise for reducing dependence on fossil fuels, promoting sustainable practices, and providing opportunities for farmers and industries.</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: Trade experts and civil society members are urging <strong>India not to ratify the fisheries subsidies agreement</strong> recently agreed upon by the <strong>World Trade Organization (WTO)</strong> members.</p>
<p><strong>What is the Fisheries Subsidies Agreement at WTO?</strong></p>
<p>The fisheries subsidies agreement agreed upon by the WTO <strong>prohibits subsidies for Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing and overfished stocks</strong>. It also restricts <strong>subsidies for fishing on the high seas</strong>, outside the jurisdiction of coastal countries and Regional Fisheries Management Organizations.</p>
<p><strong>Transition Period</strong>: Developing countries and Least Developed Countries (LDCs) are granted a <strong>two-year transition period under Special and Differential Treatment (S&amp;DT)</strong> and are not obligated to implement disciplines during this period.</p>
<p><strong>Exemptions</strong>:</p>
<p>The agreement <strong>allows subsidies for vessels or operators not engaged in IUU fishing</strong> and permits <strong>subsidies to rebuild overfished stocks</strong> to a sustainable level.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages for India:</strong></p>
<p>For India, the agreement is seen as <strong>crucial to combat large-scale IUU fishing</strong> that impacts coastal communities’ livelihoods and depletes fisheries resources.</p>

<p><strong>India’s stand</strong></p>
<p>India, being a low fisheries subsidizer with a sustainable approach, emphasizes that advanced fishing nations that have historically provided substantial subsidies and contributed to fish stock depletion should bear more <strong>responsibility based on the ‘polluter pay principle’ and ‘common but differentiated responsibilities.’</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suggestions:</strong></p>
<p>Experts have suggested India <strong>initiate talks for a comprehensive agreement</strong> that addresses <strong>industrial fishing nations’ disciplines related</strong> to overcapacity and overfishing.</p>
<p><strong>India has not yet ratified the agreement</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://phys.org/news/2023-07-nature-breakthrough-hazard-free-production-fluorochemicals.html"><strong>Phys.org</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Researchers at the University of Oxford have achieved a groundbreaking breakthrough by <strong>developing a new technique to produce fluorochemicals</strong> without using <strong>hazardous hydrogen fluoride (HF) gas</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>What are Fluorochemicals and how are they produced?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fluorochemicals are essential chemical compounds</strong> used in various industries, including polymers, agrochemicals, <strong>pharmaceuticals, and lithium-ion batteries</strong>. They are known for their unique properties, including high thermal stability and resistance to chemicals.</p>
<p>Traditionally, fluorochemicals are produced through an <strong>energy-intensive process</strong> involving the use of <strong>hazardous hydrogen fluoride (HF) gas</strong>. HF is generated by reacting a <strong>crystalline mineral called fluorspar (CaF2)</strong> with sulfuric acid under harsh conditions. This process has safety risks and environmental consequences due to HF spills.</p>
<p><strong>What is the New Method?</strong></p>
<p>Inspired by the <strong>natural biomineralization process that forms teeth and bones</strong>, researchers successfully <strong>activated solid-state calcium fluoride (CaF2)</strong> through a mechanochemical process. This innovative method, named <strong>Fluoromix</strong>, allows for the <strong>direct synthesis of over 50 different fluorochemicals from CaF2</strong> with impressive yields of up to <strong>98%</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Significance</strong>: The new approach has the potential to enhance safety and environmental impact, streamline the supply chain, and reduce energy demands in the rapidly expanding global fluorochemical industry.</p>

<li>It regulates <strong>local climatic conditions</strong>, <strong>buffering against temperature and wind extremes</strong>, providing a favourable environment for livestock, thus improving animal welfare</li>
<li>Enhancing soil quality</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance</strong>: Transitioning to more silvopasture systems by Indian farmers can help address the threats of climate change and land degradation, offering a promising solution for resilient agricultural landscapes in the face of deteriorating natural resources and forests.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> India is set to procure <strong>three additional Scorpene-class diesel-electric submarines</strong>, with the contract expected to be finalized by the end of 2024 (under Indian Navy’s project 75)</p>
<p><strong>More about the News:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The first submarine delivery is likely <strong>to take place around 2031</strong>.</li>
<li>The new submarines will have <strong>higher indigenous content</strong> and will be equipped with the DRDO-developed Air Independent Propulsion (AIP) system, enhancing their endurance.</li>
</ul>
<p>This move aims to <strong>bolster the Indian Navy’s submarine fleet</strong>, which currently consists of <strong>16 conventional submarines</strong> and is expected to deplete over the next decade due to ageing vessels.</p>
