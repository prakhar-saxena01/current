<h4 id="gs-paper-2"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Important International Institutions, agencies and fora – their Structure, Mandate</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/The_Triple_Agenda_G20-IEG_Report_Volume1_2023.pdf"><strong>CGDEV</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> An Independent Expert Group (IEG) that was commissioned by the Indian G20 Presidency has released the ‘Strengthening Multilateral Development Banks: The Triple Agenda’ report.</p>
<p><strong>What are Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs)?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An MDB is <strong>an international financial institution</strong> consisting of member nations from developed and developing countries.</li>
<li><strong>MDBs provide loans and grants</strong> to member (especially poor/ developing) nations <strong>to fund projects that support their social and economic development.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The emergence of MDBs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>At the end of WWII</strong>, delegates from 44 countries met in Bretton Woods (US) to agree upon a series of new rules for international cooperation and reconstruction.</li>
<li>This led to the creation of the <strong>IMF and World Bank Group (WBG)</strong> in <strong>1944</strong>.</li>
<li>The WB was responsible for providing <strong>financial assistance for the post-war reconstruction and economic development</strong> of the less developed countries.</li>
<li><strong>While the WBG is the oldest and the largest MDB</strong>, there are ~15-16 prominent MDBs and Regional development banks (RDBs) today.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The role played by MDGs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>MDBs have a key role to support the needed reforms and resources.</li>
<li><strong>They work with governments and the private sector</strong> to create the conditions for investment and transformation.</li>
<li>They are the most effective institutions <strong>to provide low-cost, long-maturity financing,</strong> to mitigate and share risks (in the most efficient way) faced by private investors.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges faced by MDBs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No longer suited to address the emerging global challenges:</strong> They lack resources, cultural ethos, methods and will to address the challenges like <strong>climate change and pandemics.</strong></li>
<li><strong>They are in a state of stagnation:</strong> Trapped in their procedures, approach and methods of work and resistant to structural changes.</li>
<li>Therefore, to transform development, the MDBs will have to transform themselves.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations of the IEG report – Triple agenda to harness the potential of MDBs:</strong></p>
<p><strong>The three elements of this agenda are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Adopting a triple mandate of eliminating extreme poverty, boosting shared prosperity, and contributing to global public goods;</li>
<li>Tripling sustainable lending levels by 2030; and</li>
<li><strong>Creating a third funding mechanism</strong> which would permit flexible and innovative arrangements for purposefully engaging with investors willing to support elements of the MDB agenda.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How can it be achieved?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Effective implementation of the triple agenda <strong>requires important changes in the ways that MDBs operate</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>MDBs must become effective agents</strong> in all developing countries for integrating development and climate agendas.</li>
<li><strong>They must work with governments and the private sector</strong> to reduce, share and manage risks and thereby bring down the cost of capital.</li>
<li><strong>They must change their culture</strong>, become more client-responsive, and take more risks.</li>
<li><strong>Timelines</strong> for project preparation should be shrunk and <strong>procedures</strong></li>
<li>They must also increase the scale and nature of their activities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One of the greatest opportunities for transformation is in <strong>MDB’s engagement with the private sector.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The MDB system must become more than the sum of its individual entities</strong>. Their strength has come from <strong>heterogeneity</strong>, which permits innovations in different parts of the system.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> While the reform agenda needs to be decisively put on track, there is a need for an independent monitoring group to encourage the full implementation of recommendations and report to G20 on progress.</p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-2_1"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus: Government Policies and Investment</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/diaepcb2022d3_en.pdf"><strong>UNCTAD</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The UNCTAD released a new publication – “Facilitating Investment in the Sustainable Development Goals”.</p>
<p><strong>About the publication: It is part of UNCTAD’s investment advisory series</strong>, which provides practical advice and case studies of best policy practices for <strong>attracting FDI that contribute to sustainable development.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Highlights of the publication:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To shore up funding for the UN SDGs</strong>, countries need more proactive and tailored services for investors.</li>
<li><strong>An estimated $4 trillion</strong> is required in developing countries annually to achieve the SDGs. This can be made possible through foreign investment<strong>.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The role of the investment promotion agencies (IPAs)</strong> can be significant, as they are the focal point for government-wide efforts to facilitate foreign investment.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/IPA.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/IPA.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Investment promotion vs facilitation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investment promotion</strong> is meant to attract potential investors that have not yet selected an investment destination.</li>
<li>Whereas facilitation starts at the pre-establishment phase <strong>when an investor shows interest in a location.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why does investment facilitation matter?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investment facilitation aims</strong> at making it easier for investors to establish and expand their investments, as well as conduct their day-to-day business in host countries.</li>
<li><strong>This can happen by providing</strong> relevant information, making rules and regulations more transparent and streamlining administrative procedures for investors.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How can IPAs bolster SDG implementation through investment facilitation?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>By ensuring</strong> that investment facilitation services are inclusive. This will address the specific needs and opportunities of SDG-related sectors, and specific investor groups.</li>
<li>When establishing a project, <strong>IPAs can assist in filling in the information gap</strong> by pointing investors to potential partners and incentive programmes.</li>
<li><strong>They can forge new partnerships</strong> with local governments and national ministries dealing with SDG-related investment opportunities.</li>
<li>To stay competitive in a digitalised economy post-COVID-19, <strong>IPAs have increasingly turned to digital platforms</strong> to conduct many of their promotional and facilitation services.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While sustainable investment continues to grow, <strong>such financing remains heavily concentrated in the world’s richest economies.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Most of it goes to sectors related to climate change adaptation</strong> (renewable energy), and far less towards sectors such as health, education, water and sanitation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SDG.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SDG.png" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Developing SDG project pipelines</strong> by prioritising sectors where funding is needed the most.</li>
<li><strong>Defining related targets</strong> and preparing relevant investment project profiles.</li>
<li><strong>There is a need for stronger knowledge management</strong> of insights and lessons learned on SDG investment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best practice – Invest India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The IPA</strong> has an online Industrial Land Bank that showcases all available land in several subregions that can be used for development.</li>
<li>The agency is in the process of <strong>aggregating</strong> the tool at the national level.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Investment is particularly important for SDGs-related investment, which often requires more proactive and more tailored services for investors than traditional investment.</p>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1940935"><strong>PIB</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry, and Dairying has launched the <strong>“Credit Guarantee Scheme” under the Animal Husbandry Infrastructure Development Fund (AHIDF)</strong> to support the <strong>rural economy by leveraging Micro, Small &amp; Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in the Livestock sector</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>What is Credit Guarantee Fund?</strong></p>
<p>The Credit Guarantee Fund is a <strong>financial mechanism that provides risk mitigation</strong> for lending institutions, by lending to individuals or businesses, even <strong>without sufficient collateral.</strong> If the borrower defaults, the <strong>fund reimburses the lending institution</strong> for the guaranteed portion of the loan.</p>
<p><strong>The Credit Guarantee Fund Trust,</strong> established in <strong>March 2021</strong>, is India’s <strong>first-ever fund trust</strong> under the Credit Guarantee Scheme for the agriculture and Animal Husbandry sector. It aims to significantly <strong>increase the number of MSMEs benefiting</strong> from the <strong>AHIDF scheme</strong> and strengthen the <strong>ecosystem for collateral-free credit from banks</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Features of the Scheme:</strong></p>
<p>Under the scheme, the Department of Animal Husbandry &amp; Dairying has established a <strong>Credit Guarantee Fund Trust of Rs. 750.00 crores (</strong>under <strong>NABARD)</strong>, which <strong>provides credit guarantee</strong> coverage of <strong>up to 25% for credit facilities</strong> extended to MSMEs by eligible lending institutions.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<p>This initiative aims to improve access to finance for underserved livestock entrepreneurs, especially first-generation and underprivileged individuals who lack collateral security.</p>
<p><strong>About AHIDF</strong></p>
<p>It is a <strong>Central Sector Scheme</strong> launched by the Ministry of Animal Husbandry, Fisheries, and Dairying. Its aim is to <strong>encourage investments</strong> in dairy and meat processing infrastructure, as well as animal feed plants.</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: The Indian industry aims to <strong>create separate branding for biofortified foods, similar to “organic” products, to enhance their popularity.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To promote access to nutrient-rich crops, the government is <strong>seeking the assistance of the private sector</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Biofortification</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Biofortification is a <strong>process of enhancing the nutritional content of crops by increasing the levels of essential vitamins and minerals</strong>.</li>
<li>It is a targeted approach to <strong>address nutrient deficiencies in populations, particularly in regions where people have limited access to diverse and nutritious diets.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The main objective of biofortification is to <strong>improve the nutritional status of vulnerable populations, especially in developing countries where malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies are prevalent.</strong> By enhancing the nutrient content of staple crops, such as <strong>rice, wheat, maize, and beans</strong>, biofortification aims to provide a sustainable and cost-effective solution to <strong>combat malnutrition and related health issues.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> A remarkable fossil d<strong>iscovered in north-eastern China sheds light on the complex interactions between mammals and dinosaurs during the Mesozoic Era</strong>, around 125 million years ago.</p>
<ul>
<li>The fossil shows a small badger-like <strong>mammal called Repenomamus robustus attacking a medium-sized, plant-eating dinosaur named Psittacosaurus lujiatunensis</strong>.</li>
<li>The fossil provides evidence of a <strong>smaller mammal preying on a larger dinosaur, challenging the traditional belief that dinosaurs always ate smaller mammals.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The discovery suggests that <strong>Mesozoic food webs were more complex than previously thought</strong>, with some mammals being <strong>active predators rather than just prey</strong>. This find also challenges the idea that <strong>mammals only scavenged dinosaur carcasses</strong>. The interaction between <strong>Repenomamus and Psittacosaurus is a unique example of a mammal preying on a dinosaur.</strong></p>
