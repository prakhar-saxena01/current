<p><strong>Context:</strong> According to the Anthropocene Working Group (AWG), sediments at Crawford Lake in Canada’s Ontario have provided evidence of the beginning of the Anthropocene epoch.</p>
<p><strong>AWG:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It is an interdisciplinary research group</strong> dedicated to the study of the Anthropocene as a geological time unit.</li>
<li><strong>It was established in 2009</strong> as part of the Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy (SQS), a constituent body of the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Earth’s geological timeline:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/mass.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/mass.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The geologic time scale is the <strong>calendar for events in Earth’s history</strong>.</li>
<li>It subdivides all time into units of abstract time called (in descending order of duration) – <strong>eons</strong> (about a billion years)<strong>, eras, periods, epochs, and ages</strong>.</li>
<li>Each of these categories is further divided into sub-categories. <strong>For instance</strong>, Earth’s history is characterised by four eons, including –<ul>
<li>Hadeon (oldest),</li>
<li>Archean,</li>
<li>Proterozoic, and</li>
<li>Phanerozoic (youngest).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The enumeration of these geologic time units is based on <strong>stratigraphy</strong>, which is the correlation and classification of <strong>rock strata</strong> – which contains different kinds of fossils characterising different intervals of time.</li>
<li>Officially, we’re in the <strong>Phanerozoic eon, Cenozoic era, Quaternary period, Holocene epoch and the Meghalayan age</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Holocene</strong> <strong>epoch:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Holocene</strong> is the current geological epoch, which began approximately 11,700 years ago<strong>.</strong></li>
<li><strong>It follows the Last Glacial Period</strong> and the Holocene along with the preceding Pleistocene forms the Quaternary period.</li>
<li>The Holocene, which has been identified with the <strong>current warm period</strong>, corresponds with the <strong>rapid proliferation, growth and impacts of the human species worldwide.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the Anthropocene epoch?</strong></p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-2"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Statutory, Regulatory and various Quasi-judicial Bodies</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/undermining-autonomy-the-hindu-editorial-on-judicial-endorsement-of-a-tenure-extension-system/article67071808.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The SC asked the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/10/enforcement-directorate-ed/">ED</a> Director to quit (4 months before his third extension ends) even as it upheld statutory amendments which facilitate the tenures of Directors of the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/04/02/220937/">CBI</a> and the ED to be stretched.</p>
<p><strong>The timeline which leads to the recent verdict:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The current Enforcement Directorate (ED) Director (Mr SK Mishra) was appointed for a two-year term in 2018.<ul>
<li>In 2020, the original appointment was retrospectively amended to make it a three-year tenure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>In 2021</strong>, the SC directed the government to stop giving extensions to the ED Director.</li>
<li><strong>In order to tweak the above verdict</strong>, amendments were enacted in 2021 to the Central Vigilance Commission Act, the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act.<ul>
<li>This allows a maximum of <strong>3 annual extensions</strong> (taking a total term of 5 years) to the Directors of CBI and ED on the recommendation of <strong>High-Level Committees</strong>.</li>
<li>Earlier, CBI and ED chiefs have fixed tenures of two years.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>He was given two annual extensions in 2021 and 2022, despite crossing the age of superannuation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The High-Level Committees:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A five-member panel composed of the Central Vigilance Commissioner and Vigilance Commissioners had to recommend if an <strong>ED Director</strong> was worthy of an extension in service.</li>
<li>In the case of the <strong>CBI Director</strong>, a High-Level Committee of the Prime Minister, Opposition Leader and the Chief Justice of India had to recommend.</li>
<li>These committees were required <strong>to record reasons in writing</strong> in support of their recommendations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The recent verdict:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/apex-1.png"></a><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/apex.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/apex.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The back-to-back service extensions given to the ED Director in 2021 and 2022 were <strong>illegal</strong>, as they were not as per the recommendations of the High-Level Committees.</li>
<li><strong>By upholding the 2021 amendments</strong>, the court disagreed with the argument that the Centre could use the service extensions as a <strong>‘carrot and stick’ policy</strong> – against the principle of insulating these agencies from government pressure.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Takeaways from the SC’s verdict:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A setback to the cause of protecting institutional independence.</strong><ul>
<li>While the part of the judgement quashing the extensions given to the ED Director, may be welcomed, the rest of it is <strong>a free pass to the government to undermine the autonomy of these agencies.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Even though Parliament can remove the basis for any judgement through legislation, <strong>it cannot nullify a court direction</strong>.<ul>
<li>The Court’s earlier observation that such extension should be given to those who have attained superannuation only in “<strong>rare and exceptional cases</strong>”, was ignored by the government.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>At a time when there is a cloud of suspicion over the misuse of government agencies against political opponents, the Court’s endorsement of a tenure extension system designed to undermine their independence is <strong>not conducive to the rule of law.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> In the <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/loot-intransigence-and-the-darkening-of-a-colonial-blot/article67072849.ece#:~:text=A%20trauma%20that%20lingers&amp;text=The%20return%20of%20cultural%20items,than%20financial%20reparations%20would%20be.">editorial</a> article, Shashi Tharoor discusses the issue of <strong>colonial-era artefacts and the need for moral atonement alongside financial reparations.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is Moral atonement?</strong></p>
<p>It refers to the <strong>act of acknowledging and taking responsibility</strong> for one’s moral wrongdoings or harmful actions and seeking to <strong>make amends or seek forgiveness</strong>. It involves a sincere effort to make things right <strong>on a moral level</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Recent Example:</strong> Netherlands will return hundreds of colonial-era artefacts — including a bejewelled, ceremonial cannon—to Sri Lanka. Also, British and German museums returned the so-called Benin Bronzes stolen from Nigeria during a large-scale 1897 British military expedition.</p>
<p><strong>Other examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in 2016 apologised on behalf of Canada for denying permission for the <strong>Indian immigrants on the Komagata Maru</strong> to land in Vancouver (in 1914), thereby sending most of them to their deaths.</li>
<li><strong>Willy Brandt (Chancellor of Germany)</strong> sank to his knees at the Warsaw Ghetto in 1970 to apologise to Polish Jews for the Holocaust.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example from daily life:</strong></p>
<p>Imagine you accidentally break your friend’s favourite mug while visiting their house. You feel guilty and understand that you have caused them distress.</p>
<p><strong>To make moral atonement, you would take the following steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Acknowledge your mistake</strong>: Admit that you broke your friend’s mug and understand that it was your fault.</li>
<li><strong>Apologize:</strong> Express sincere remorse for your actions and apologize to your friend for the damage caused.</li>
<li><strong>Take responsibility</strong>: Offer to replace the mug or compensate your friend for its value as a way of taking responsibility for your actions.</li>
<li><strong>Learn from the experience</strong>: Reflect on what happened and learn from your mistake. Promise to be more careful and considerate in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other ethical words involved:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Restitution</strong> refers to the <strong>act of returning or restoring something</strong> that was taken, stolen, or lost to its rightful owner. It involves making amends or compensating for past injustices or wrongdoings.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, returning cultural artefacts or artworks to their country of origin, which were acquired through colonialism or looting, can be seen as a form of restitution.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reparation</strong> refers to the act of making amends or providing compensation for harm or injustice caused. It involves <strong>acknowledging and addressing past wrongs</strong> to achieve justice.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, providing <strong>financial compensation or support to individuals or communities who were victims of slaver</strong>y or other forms of historical oppression can be considered reparations.</li>

<p>The launch of <strong>Meta’s social media platform Threads</strong> led to heightened tensions between Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk. Musk called Zuckerberg a <strong>“cuck” in a tweet,</strong> following a screenshot of a conversation between Zuckerberg and Wendy’s.</p>
<p><strong>Ethical Issues:</strong> The ethical issues involved in Musk calling Zuckerberg a “cuck” include the use of derogatory language, perpetuating misogyny, and engaging in online harassment. This behaviour promotes a <strong>toxic online environment and undermines respectful communication</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Usage: The example can be used to show how leaders/Celebrities should not behave in public spaces.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>:  The Supreme Court of India has agreed to hear different perspectives to <strong>find a humane and long-lasting solution</strong> to conflicts between humans and stray dogs, particularly in the state of Kerala.</p>
<ul>
<li>The court was responding to a plea by the Kannur district panchayat to <strong>euthanize stray dogs</strong> deemed to be <strong>“suspected rabid” and “extremely dangerous.”</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Two views</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>View 1:</strong> <strong>Advocates representing the district panchayat</strong> highlighted the case of an 11-year-old boy who was fatally attacked by stray dogs. Several such cases of dog attacks have come across throughout India.</li>
<li><strong>View 2:</strong> <strong>Animal rights activists</strong> emphasized that local authorities should strictly implement animal birth control rules and prevent cruelty towards stray dogs. Instances of hanging, poisoning, and drowning of stray dogs have been reported, and activists are advocating for their protection</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> A viral video on social media shows the formation of spectacular clouds known as <strong>shelf clouds or Arcus clouds during heavy monsoon rains</strong> in Haridwar, India.</p>
<ul>
<li>The video, shared on Twitter, depicts a <strong>towering wall of clouds with a horizontal rotation</strong>. The authenticity of the video has not been independently confirmed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Shelf Clouds:</strong></p>
<p>Shelf clouds are <strong>wedge-shaped formations that appear on the leading edge of storms</strong>. They occur when <strong>cold and dense air is forcefully driven into a warmer air mass during the downdraft of a thunderstorm</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>How it is formed?</strong></p>
<p>Shelf clouds form <strong>when warm, moist air is lifted rapidly by an advancing thunderstorm or cold front.</strong> As the warm air rises, it cools and condenses, forming a cloud. The rising air creates a boundary between the cool, downdraft air from the storm and the warm, updraft air ahead of it. The shelf cloud is usually dark and ominous-looking due to the condensation and the presence of rain or hail within the storm.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> A new study published in Nature reveals that <strong>climate change has caused a change in the colour of 56 per cent of the world’s oceans.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The study found that waters in the tropics, <strong>particularly the southern Indian Ocean,</strong> have <strong>turned green</strong>. Green-coloured water indicates an <strong>increase in phytoplankton, microscopic plant-like organisms that are crucial for marine life and carbon dioxide absorption.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Phytoplankton, which are <strong>microscopic plant-like organisms</strong> that live in the ocean. Phytoplankton contains <strong>chlorophyll</strong>, a pigment that gives them a green colour. The change in ocean colour is an indicator of <strong>alterations in the phytoplankton communities.</strong></p>
<p>The researchers analysed data from the <strong>Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)</strong> aboard the <strong>Aqua satellite</strong>, which has been <strong>monitoring ocean colour for two decades</strong>. They observed long-term trends and used models to simulate scenarios with and without greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
