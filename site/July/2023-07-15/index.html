<h4 id="gs-paper-1"><strong>GS Paper 1</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus: Evolution of the Solar System and Earth</strong></p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: India successfully sent its Chandrayaan 3 mission to the moon.</p>
<p><strong>Formation of Earth and Moon:</strong></p>
<p>The formation of the Earth and Moon is believed to have occurred around <strong>4.5 billion years</strong> ago. The process can be summarized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accretion</strong>: Small particles in the early solar system collided and stuck together, forming larger objects called planetesimals and eventually protoplanets.</li>
<li><strong>Giant Impact</strong>: A Mars-sized protoplanet called <strong>Theia</strong> collided with the young Earth, causing a massive impact that ejected debris into space.</li>
<li><strong>Formation of the Moon:</strong> The debris from the impact began to orbit the Earth and eventually came together to create the Moon.</li>
<li><strong>Differentiation</strong>: Both the Earth and Moon underwent differentiation, where materials separated based on density. Heavier elements sank towards the core, while lighter elements rose to the surface, forming distinct layers.</li>
<li><strong>Lunar Evolution:</strong> The Moon cooled and solidified over time. It experienced volcanic activity and large impact events, leading to the formation of craters, basins, and other geological features like lunar maria.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/earth_moon.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/earth_moon.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>The moon has had a profound impact on the evolution of life on Earth:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Water on Earth</strong>: The planet that collided with Earth, ‘Theia’ came from the outer solar system and delivered large quantities of water to Earth.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on Tectonic Plates</strong>: The moon’s pull of gravity might have set our tectonic plates.</li>
<li><strong>Impact of moon’s</strong> <strong>gravitational pull</strong>: Moon’s gravitational pull helps transport heat away from the equator and towards the poles, fundamentally shaping the earth’s climate.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on Earth’s rotation</strong>: Moon also stabilises the Earth’s rotation on its axis by <strong>slowing Earth’s rotation on its axis</strong>.<ul>
<li>The Moon’s presence <strong>helps stabilize Earth’s axial tilt and its climate</strong>. This stability has allowed for the <strong>development of seasons,</strong> which have had a significant impact on the distribution of water and the evolution of life.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Impact on Earth</strong>: The moon’s presence <strong>stabilizes Earth’s climate, transports heat and helps regulate the Earth’s rotation</strong> on its axis.</li>
<li><strong>Impact of Tides:</strong> The regular movement of water that <strong>exposes the land at the edge of the ocean,</strong> could have encouraged <strong>life to adapt and move from the oceans to land.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Impact on biological cycle</strong>: Lunar cycles affect the <strong>reproductive cycles of marine life</strong> and other animal behaviours.<ul>
<li>The <strong>laying and hatching of turtles’ eggs</strong> depend on the timings of tides</li>
<li>Moonlight affects the <strong>behaviour of nocturnal animals and triggers species-wide reproduction e.g., Corals</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Moon holds much significance for humankind from geological as well as space exploration points of view. India’s Chandrayaan 3 mission is a step in that direction to better understand the moon’s geology and its potential for humankind.</p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-1-3"><strong>GS Paper 1/ 3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Geophysical phenomena/Climate/Conservation, environmental pollution and degradation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/world/road-to-2030-why-sand-dust-storms-pose-challenge-to-achieving-multiple-sdgs-90622#:~:text=Sand%20and%20dust%20storms%20often,contribute%20to%20climate%2Drelated%20impacts."><strong>DTE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> According to the UN, sand and dust storms (SDS) have increased dramatically in frequency and severity in recent years.</p>
<p><strong>What is SDS?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>They are <strong>common meteorological hazards in arid and semi-arid regions</strong>, usually caused by thunderstorms/ strong pressure gradients associated with cyclones, which <strong>increase wind speed over a wide area.</strong></li>
<li>These strong winds <strong>lift large amounts of sand and dust from bare, dry soils</strong> into the atmosphere, transporting them hundreds to thousands of km away.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>On weather/climate/environment:</strong><ul>
<li>Dust particles act as <strong>condensation nuclei</strong> for cloud formation <strong>affecting the amount and location of precipitation.</strong></li>
<li>Airborne dust functions in a manner similar to the <strong>greenhouse effect</strong>, which affects the energy reaching the Earth’s surface.</li>
<li>SDS are recurring environmental phenomena which reduce <strong>air quality, and visibility.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>On human health:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Particles larger than 10 μm</strong> are not breathable, and thus can only damage external organs.</li>
<li><strong>Particles smaller than 10 μm</strong>, often get trapped in the nose, mouth and upper respiratory tract, and thus can be associated with respiratory disorders such as asthma, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>On the land and marine ecosystems:</strong><ul>
<li>Surface dust deposits are a <strong>source of micronutrients</strong> for both continental and maritime ecosystems. <strong>For example</strong>, Saharan dust is thought to fertilise the Amazon rainforest.</li>
<li>But dust also has <strong>many negative impacts on agriculture/food security</strong>, including<ul>
<li>Reducing crop yields by burying seedlings,</li>
<li>Causing loss of plant tissue,</li>
<li>Reducing photosynthetic activity and</li>
<li>Increasing soil erosion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Primary hotspots of the dust storm are:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/dust_storm.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/dust_storm.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Sahara Desert,</li>
<li>Middle East,</li>
<li>Taklamakan Desert in northwest China,</li>
<li>Southwest Asia,</li>
<li>Central Australia,</li>
<li>Etosha and Makgadikgadi basins of southern Africa,</li>
<li>Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia and</li>
<li>Great Basin in the US</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Concerns raised by the UN:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Around 2 million tonnes</strong> of sand and dust enter the atmosphere annually.</li>
<li>SDS often originate in dryland areas, which cover <strong>41% of the Earth’s land surface</strong> and comprise some of the most fragile ecosystems, highly susceptible to global climate change.</li>
<li><strong>Human-induced climate change</strong> has increased the frequency and intensity of SDS.</li>
<li>The impact of SDS is felt in <strong>all regions of the world</strong>, both in developed and developing countries.</li>
<li>The growing intensity and frequency of SDS <strong>present a formidable challenge to achieving SDGs</strong>.</li>
<li>SDS are linked to at least 11 of 17 SDGs. These include –<ul>
<li>SDG 1 on ending poverty,</li>
<li>SDG 2 on ending hunger,</li>
<li>SDG 3 on health for all,</li>
<li>SDG 6 on water and sanitation,</li>
<li>SDG 8 on inclusive and sustainable economic growth,</li>
<li>SDG 11 on sustainable cities,</li>
<li>SDG 13 on climate action and</li>
<li>SDG 15 focuses on combating desertification, land degradation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>These will <strong>especially affect Africa and the Middle East</strong> where desertification is most common.</li>
<li>However, <strong>the global recognition of SDS as a hazard is generally low</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steps taken/needed:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The UN General Assembly recognised</strong> (in 2015) that SDS pose a great challenge to the sustainable development of affected countries and regions.</li>
<li><strong>The UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD)</strong> observed the first-ever <strong>International Day of Combatting Sand and Dust Storms</strong> on July 12, 2023.</li>
<li><strong>Achieving SDGs ⇄</strong> Reducing the occurrence and impact of SDS in affected areas.</li>
<li><strong>Arresting land degradation:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ldn.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ldn.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The SDS policy and planning</strong> should reduce societal vulnerability by mitigating the effects of wind erosion.</li>
<li><strong>A multi-sectoral process bolstered by information-sharing</strong> should involve short-and long-term interventions, engage multiple stakeholders and raise awareness of SDS.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion: Addressing SDS requires an integrated approach</strong>, which involves sustainable land management, climate change mitigation and adaptation, and disaster risk reduction including early warning systems and international cooperation.</p>

<p>The Namda Art of Kashmir, a dying craft, has been <strong>successfully revived through the Skill India project</strong> under the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY).</p>
<p>Nearly 2,200 candidates from six districts of Jammu and Kashmir have <strong>received training in this traditional art form</strong>.</p>
<p>The project, implemented in collaboration with local industry partners, <strong>showcases the power of public-private partnerships in driving skill development</strong> and economic growth.</p>
<p><strong>Usage</strong>: the example can be used in questions related to success of Skill development questions.</p>
<p><strong>About Namda art:</strong></p>
<p>It is a <strong>traditional Kashmiri craft that involves creating felted carpets</strong> using sheep wool and hand embroidery. It originated in the 16th century and was introduced by a Sufi saint named <strong>Shah-e-Hamdan</strong>. Namda rugs provide warmth and are used as floor coverings and home decor.</p>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/western-ghats-lost-5-evergreen-forest-cover-shows-analysis/article67079915.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: Western Ghats has experienced a <strong>5% loss in evergreen forest cover</strong>, with an increase in built-up and agriculture areas, according to a s<strong>patiotemporal</strong> (belonging to both space and time or to space–time) analysis of land use.</p>
<p><strong>Key findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Only 25% of the forest landmass consists</strong> of interior forests, indicating fragmentation pressure and its impact on local ecology.</li>
<li>The region witnessed <strong>large-scale land cover changes during the past century</strong> due to unplanned developmental activities with industrialisation and globalisation.</li>
<li>Highlights <strong>high ecological fragility in the area.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance</strong>: The findings emphasize the <strong>need for conservation measures and sustainable development</strong> policies in the Western Ghats to address the threats to forests and water security in the region.</p>
<p><strong>What is Ecological fragility?</strong></p>
<p>It refers to the <strong>vulnerability of an ecosystem to disturbance or damage</strong>, often resulting in the loss of biodiversity and disruption of ecological processes. It represents the <strong>delicate balance and sensitivity of natural systems</strong> to human activities and environmental changes.</p>
<p>For example, <strong>deforestation in a rainforest can disrupt the intricate web of species interactions</strong>, causing species extinction and the loss of vital ecological functions such as carbon sequestration and water regulation.</p>
<p><strong>About the analysis:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>The Indian Institute of Science’s Energy and Wetlands Research Group</strong> launched the Western Ghats Spatial Decision Support System (WGSDSS) to enhance governance transparency and aid in the management of the ecologically vital <strong>Sahyadri hill ranges</strong>. The system provides comprehensive information on <strong>ecological, socio-economic, biodiversity</strong>, and environmental aspects, supporting effective decision-making.</p>
<p><strong>About Western Ghats:</strong></p>
<p>The Western Ghats, also known as the Sahyadri Hills, is a <strong>biodiversity hotspot in India</strong> ( it is among <strong>36 global biodiversity hotspots</strong>). It is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is home to a rich and unique assemblage of flora and fauna.</p>

<p>France’s decision to <strong>supply Ukraine with SCALP missiles</strong> as part of the ongoing counter-offensive against Russian forces has sparked anger from Russia. The SCALP missile, also known <strong>as Storm Shadow, is a long-range, conventionally armed missile</strong> designed to neutralize high-value targets and can strike deep inside Russian territory.</p>
<p>France consists of a <strong>terrain that is mostly flat plains or gently rolling hills</strong> in the north and west and mountainous in the south (including the Massif Central and the Pyrenees) and the east (the highest points being in the Alps). France (a NATO member) is helping Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression.</p>
