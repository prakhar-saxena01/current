<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Physical Geography of India (Drainage, Climate)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/north-india-himachal-rains-flood-climate-explained/article67064497.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Northern India is currently in the midst of an extremely wet phase of the monsoon.</p>
<p><strong>What is an extremely heavy rainfall event?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It occurs when <strong>more than 205 mm of rainfall</strong> happens at any place within a 24-hour period. (IMD)</li>
<li>Such events of extremely heavy rainfall are <strong>not unexpected</strong> during the monsoon season.</li>
<li>After the 2013 Uttarakhand tragedy, there has not been a single year without at least one major disaster-like situation produced by an extreme rainfall event.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Trends in recent years:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/trends.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/trends.jpg?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overall rainfall</strong> during the monsoon <strong>has remained more or less constant</strong> over the last two decades.</li>
<li><strong>But the intra-seasonal variation has increased –</strong> fewer days are producing a bulk of the seasonal rainfall, while the rest of the days remain dry.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How is this year’s monsoon rainfall unusual?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The monsoon season this year was not expected to be very wet.</li>
<li>July rainfall in Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh is <strong>substantially higher</strong> (by 26%) <strong>than normal</strong>.</li>
<li>Heavy rain has resulted in <strong>large-scale destruction and loss of lives</strong>, particularly in the hilly areas.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/monson.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/monson.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Reasons for this extreme rainfall:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rains induced by the Biparjoy cyclone:</strong> By the first two weeks of the monsoon, India had accumulated a rainfall deficit of more than 50%. However, this deficit had come down to 8% by the end of June.</li>
<li><strong>Western disturbances:</strong> IMD has attributed this spell to an interaction between the monsoon winds and western disturbances that converged over northern India.</li>
<li><strong>Climate change:</strong> It is known to increase the possibility, frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, including heavy rainfall and heat waves.</li>
<li><strong>Warming of the Arabian Sea:</strong> Excess rainfall over northwest India is consistent with the Arabian Sea having warmed by about 1.5 degrees Celsius since January.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How can Indian cities bring themself out of these troubled waters?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The authorities need to plan the usage of shallow aquifers to prevent waterlogging.</li>
<li>At the same time, the city needs to recharge the deeper aquifers with rainwater.</li>
<li>Forming a <strong>water plan to recharge aquifers</strong></li>
<li><strong>Rainwater harvesting structures</strong> along the stormwater drains can help mitigate floods while utilizing rainwater resources.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Only improved forecasts with sufficient granularity in space and time can reduce the element of surprise resulting from these extreme weather events.</p>

<p>With reference to Ocean Mean Temperature (OMT), which of the following statements is/are correct?</p>
<ol>
<li>OMT is measured up to a depth of 26°C isotherm which is 129 meters in the southwestern Indian Ocean during January — March.</li>
<li>OMT collected during January — March can be used in assessing whether the amount of rainfall in the monsoon will be less or more than a certain long-term mean.</li>
</ol>
<p>Select the correct answer using the code given below:</p>
<ol>
<li>1 only</li>
<li>2 only</li>
<li>Both 1 and 2</li>
<li>Neither 1 nor 2</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Ans: 2</strong></p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> World Population Day (July 11) is a time to look at how India’s demographic journey has changed the lives of its citizens, particularly its women.</p>
<p><strong>India’s population:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It grew from about 340 million at Independence to <strong>4 billion</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>This growth was fuelled by</strong> the improvement in public health, food security, etc. <strong>For example,</strong> male life expectancy was about 56 years (in 1941); today, it is 69 years.</li>
<li>With this rapid decline in mortality, <strong>parents no longer needed to have four children</strong> to ensure that at least two would survive.</li>
<li>As a result, the <strong>Total Fertility Rate (TFR)</strong> fell from 5.7 in 1950 to 2.1 in 2019.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact of reduced TFR:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It brought a <strong>tectonic shift in the lives of Indian women</strong>.</li>
<li>Women’s childhood, adulthood, and old age have been <strong>transformed</strong> (both positively and negatively) <strong>over the course of the demographic transition</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Change for Indian women:</strong></p>

<td>Women generally marry men who are older and are more likely to outlive their husbands.<br><br>The 2011 Census shows that while only 18% of men above age 65 are widowed, <strong>about 55% of the women are widowed.</strong><br><br>For widowed women, the lack of access to savings and property results in <strong>dependence on children, mainly sons, bringing the vicious cycle of son preference to full circle.</strong></td>

<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Women need to establish secure connections</strong> to the labour market and gain work experience if they are to get skilled jobs.</li>
<li><strong>Enhancing women’s access to employment and assets</strong> will reduce their reliance on sons and could break the vicious cycle of gendered disadvantage.</li>
<li>As early marriage and childbearing remain central to Indian women’s lives, any efforts at improving women’s labour force participation <strong>must be accompanied by access to safe and affordable childcare.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to ensure access to safe and affordable childcare?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS)</strong> can be used to develop social infrastructure where NREGS workers can help staff crèches.</li>
<li>The burgeoning self-help group movement can be harnessed to set up <strong>neighbourhood child-care centres</strong> in urban and rural areas.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best practice:</strong> Crèche facilities in Anganwadis in MP led to an increase in the work participation of mothers.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Demographic dividends cannot be realised without fully harnessing the gender dividend. As changing patriarchal norms may take a long time, improving access to childcare (for working women) is a low-hanging fruit.</p>

<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Issues Relating to Poverty and Hunger</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/india-registers-remarkable-reduction-in-poverty-with-415-million-people-coming-out-of-it-in-15-years-united-nations/article67066698.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> According to the global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) 2023, a total of 415 million people moved out of poverty in India within just 15 years from 2005/2006 to 2019/2021.</p>
<p><strong>What is the global MPI?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is a key international resource that measures (annually) acute multidimensional poverty across more than 100 developing countries.</li>
<li><strong>First launched in 2010 by UNDP</strong> and Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI)<strong>, the global MPI advances SDG 1 – ending poverty in all its forms everywhere.</strong></li>
<li>It also measures interconnected deprivations across indicators related to SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 11.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How does it measure multidimensional poverty?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/dimension.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/dimension.png" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>By constructing a deprivation profile</strong> for each household and person <strong>across 10 indicators</strong> spanning <strong>health, education and standard of living.</strong></li>
<li><strong>A person is multidimensionally poor</strong> if s/he is deprived in one-third/33% or more of the weighted indicators out of the 10 indicators.</li>
<li>Those who are deprived of one-half or more of the weighted indicators are considered living in <strong>extreme multidimensional poverty.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance of the global MPI:</strong> It monitors poverty reduction and informs policy, showing how people experience poverty in different aspects of their daily lives.</p>

<p><strong>Good news: 25 countries, including India</strong>, successfully halved their global MPI values within 15 years.</p>
<p><strong>Concerns:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Child poverty</strong> will continue to be a pressing issue, particularly in relation to school attendance and undernutrition. The poverty rate among children is <strong>27.</strong><strong>7%,</strong> while among adults is 13.4%.</li>
<li><strong>Poverty predominantly affects rural areas</strong>, with 84% of all poor people living in rural areas.</li>
<li><strong>The lack of comprehensive data</strong> during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic poses challenges in assessing immediate prospects.</li>
<li><strong>The negative impacts of the pandemic</strong> in dimensions such as education are significant and can have long-lasting consequences.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Case of India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In 2005/2006, about 645 million people were in multidimensional poverty in India, with this number declining to about 370 million in 2015/2016 and 230 million in 2019/2021.<ul>
<li>Thus, <strong>415 million</strong> poor people moved out of poverty from 2005/2006 to 2019/2021.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Incidence fell from 55.1 to <strong>16.4%</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Deprivation in all indicators declined.</strong></li>
<li>The poorest states and groups, including children and people in disadvantaged caste groups, had the fastest absolute progress.</li>
<li>The above findings are significant as <strong>India surpassed China</strong> (in Apr 2023) to become the world’s most populous nation with <strong>142 crore people.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intensify efforts</strong> to comprehend the dimensions most negatively affected.</li>
<li><strong>Strengthen data collection and policy efforts</strong> to get poverty reduction back on track.</li>
<li><strong>Broaden the picture</strong> to include the impacts of the pandemic on children.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The report demonstrates that poverty reduction is achievable, demonstrating the feasibility of the SDG target – <strong>ending poverty in all its forms everywhere by 2030.</strong></p>

<p>The use of wastewater for public health surveillance offers significant benefits for disease prevention and control. It is a <strong>cost-effective approach</strong> that does not rely on invasive samples from individuals. Wastewater surveillance, integrated with existing <strong>surveillance mechanisms</strong>, could enhance <strong>India’s epidemiological capabilities</strong> by providing real-time insights into <strong>community-level disease patterns</strong>. This integration could be facilitated through efforts to strengthen public health laboratory networks and the <strong>Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Usage</strong>: Wastewater surveillance for community disease prevention can be used as a point or way forward</p>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/adani-hindenburg-case-lack-of-requirement-to-disclose-last-natural-person-above-every-person-owning-economic-interest-in-fpis-is-the-challenge-sebi-to-sc/article67063642.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) clarified in the Supreme Court that the challenges it faced in the <strong>Hindenburg-Adani allegations case</strong> were from the lack of a requirement to disclose the <strong>‘last natural person above every person’ owning an economic interest in the FPIs.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is ‘Last Natural Person Above Every Person’?</strong></p>
<p>It refers to the requirement to <strong>identify and disclose the ultimate individual</strong> who has control or ownership over a financial investment such as Foreign Portfolio Investor (FPI). It means revealing the <strong>final person in the ownership chain</strong> who holds an economic interest in the FPI, ensuring transparency and accountability in the investment structure.</p>
<p>However, most of the national and international laws don’t have such provisions,</p>
<p><strong>FPI Vs FDI?</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FPI (Foreign Portfolio Investment)</strong> refers to investments made by foreign individuals or entities in financial assets such as stocks, bonds, or mutual funds of a country.</li>
<li><strong>FDI (Foreign Direct Investment),</strong> on the other hand, refers to investments made by foreign individuals or entities <strong>in tangible assets</strong> such as businesses, properties, or infrastructure projects in a country. FDI typically involves a <strong>long-term commitment and a significant level of control and ownership</strong> in the invested entity, while FPI involves relatively <strong>shorter-term investments</strong> in financial instruments without obtaining control or ownership rights.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges posed by FPIs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>FPIs use multiple platforms, each below the limit for beneficial owner identification, to hold stakes (thus remaining below the radar of regulatory agencies)</li>
<li>FPIs operate in tax haven jurisdictions, creating ambiguity around their ownership and control.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SEBI’s recently Proposed Disclosure Requirements for FPIs</strong></p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong>  Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman stated that the Indian economy has overcome the twin-balance sheet problem and now <strong>enjoys a twin-balance sheet advantage</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>What is the Twin-Balance Sheet problem?</strong></p>
<p>The twin-balance sheet problem refers to a situation in which <strong>both banks and corporates face financial distress simultaneously</strong>. It occurs when banks have a high amount of non-performing assets (bad loans) (NPA of public sector banks reached almost 12% in 2016-17) on their balance sheets, and corporates have accumulated excessive debt, leading to a negative impact on the overall economy.</p>
<p><strong>RBI’s recent Financial Stability Report</strong> states that both banking and corporate sector balance sheets have strengthened and India might be on the cusp of a <strong>twin balance sheet advantage</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The gross NPA ratio</strong> fell to a 10-year low <strong>of 3.9%.</strong></li>
<li>The corporate balance sheet is also at its healthiest in 10 years.</li>
<li><strong>The profitability of public sector banks</strong> has tripled since 2014, reaching over ₹1 lakh crore in 2022-23.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Some of the initiatives taken by the government are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>4R strategy</strong> (recognizing, recapitalizing, resolving, and reforming);</li>
<li><strong>Central Repository of Information on Large Credits</strong> (CRILC) to enable banks to share information on large loans;</li>
<li><strong>Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code</strong>, 2016</li>
<li><strong>National Asset Reconstruction Company</strong>(NARCL) to handle bad debt</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) has developed a new variety of wheat called <strong>PBW RS1</strong>, which has <strong>high amylose starch content</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reduce the risks of type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases</strong>: Chapatis made from this wheat release glucose more slowly into the bloodstream, providing a feeling of satiety and potentially reducing the <strong>prevalence of diet-related diseases</strong>.</li>
<li>It is resistant to <strong>yellow rust and moderately resistant to brown rust fungal diseases</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Concern:</strong></p>
<p>It has slightly lower productivity compared to other varieties.</p>
<p><strong>About Starch:</strong></p>
<p>Starch is a <strong>complex carbohydrate found in various plant-based foods</strong>, such as grains, potatoes, and legumes. It serves as a storage form of energy in plants. Starch is composed of glucose molecules that are joined together in long chains.</p>
<p><strong>About Amylose:</strong></p>
<p>Amylose is a type of starch found in various <strong>carbohydrate-rich foods</strong>, including grains like wheat. It is one of the two main components of starch, the other being <strong>amylopectin</strong>. Foods with <strong>higher amylose content generally have a slower digestion rate</strong> and a lower impact on blood sugar levels compared to foods with higher amylopectin content.</p>
