<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> It is a legal document issued by the court that orders a person or entity to perform a specific act or to cease performing a specific action.</li>
<li><strong>Constitutional provisions:</strong> Issued by the Supreme Court under <strong>Article 32</strong> and by the High Court under <strong>Article 226</strong> of the Constitution of India.</li>
<li><strong>Types:</strong> Habeas Corpus (to have a body of), Mandamus (we command), Quo Warranto (by what warrant(, Certiorari (to certify) and Prohibition.</li>

<p><strong>The ruling:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Madras HC</strong> passed the ruling while dismissing a writ petition which claimed that the constitutional machinery had broken down due to the attack on IT officials by a mob.</li>
<li>The HC held that Article 355 appeared to have been inspired both by <strong>the US and the Australian Constitution.</strong></li>
<li>The scope of Article 355 <strong>enables the Union to render all assistance,</strong> even if the State Government has not made any specific request.</li>
<li>The incident of IT officials being mobbed <strong>would not qualify as an internal disturbance</strong> under the purview of Article 355.</li>
<li>The expressions –<ul>
<li><strong>‘internal disturbance’</strong> could only refer to a sense of <strong>domestic chaos</strong> (could take the colour of a security threat) and</li>
<li><strong>‘external aggression’</strong> would require a large-scale public disorder (endangering the security and administration of the State).</li>

<h4 id="gs-paper-2_1"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Mechanisms, Laws, Institutions and Bodies constituted for the Protection and Betterment of Vulnerable Sections</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/govt-set-to-announce-india-manual-scavenging-free-by-august-246-districts-yet-to-self-declare/article67045733.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> According to the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment (MoSJE), all unsanitary latrines had been made sanitary under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan and <strong>the problem of manual scavenging is eliminated.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The practice of manual scavenging in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> Manual scavenging includes the disposal of human excreta manually from dry latrines, and public streets and the maintenance and sweeping of septic tanks, sewers and gutters.</li>
<li><strong>Prevalence in India:</strong><ul>
<li>As many as <strong>58,000</strong> people worked as manual scavengers as of 2018.</li>
<li><strong>In 2022, 48 people died</strong> due to hazardous cleaning of sewers in 2022. This number was 49 in 2021, 19 in 2020, and 117 in 2019.</li>
<li>The practice, which is considered the worst remaining evidence of untouchability, is <strong>most prevalent among people from lower castes/Dalits.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Attempts to abolish manual scavenging:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/time_line.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/time_line.png" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Salient features of the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act 2013:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It bans manual scavenging</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>It widened the definition of manual scavengers</strong> by including it in all forms of manual removal of human excreta.</li>
<li><strong>It lays</strong> a <strong>key focus on rehabilitating manual scavengers</strong> by organising training programs (at a stipend of Rs. 3000) and offering scholarships to their children.</li>
<li>It makes the offence of manual scavenging <strong>cognizable and non-bailable.</strong></li>
<li>It makes it <strong>obligatory for employers to provide</strong> <strong>protective tools</strong> to the workers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other efforts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The scheme for rehabilitation of manual scavengers:</strong> Under this, ~58,000 identified sewer workers have been <strong>given a one-time cash payout of ₹40,000 each</strong>.<ul>
<li>In addition, ~22,000 of them have been connected to skills training programmes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>NAMASTE scheme:</strong> For 100% mechanisation of sewer work. The scheme (launched in 2022) for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers has now been merged with the NAMASTE scheme.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Concerns:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of funding:</strong> The Union Budget 2023-24 showed no allocation for the rehabilitation scheme and ₹100 crore allocation for the NAMASTE scheme.</li>
<li><strong>Less than half of the identified sewer workers</strong> are connected to skills training programmes.</li>
<li>Despite all efforts, manual scavenging is <strong>still practised in India.</strong> Just 520 districts across the country had declared themselves free of manual scavenging<strong>.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The immediate focus of administrations should be to <strong>ensure zero deaths</strong> due to hazardous cleaning of sewers and septic tanks.</li>
<li>All local bodies must <strong>identify and profile all septic tank/sewer workers</strong> in their respective areas.</li>
<li>Provide them with <strong>occupational training and safety equipment.</strong></li>
<li>Sign them up for health insurance under the <strong>Ayushman Bharat scheme.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best practices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Bandicoot Robot</strong> is the world’s first robotic scavenger, developed as a Make in India and Swachh Bharat Abhiyan initiative by the startup Genrobotics.</li>
<li><strong>Kerala became the first state</strong> in the country to use robotic technology (Bandicoot) to clean all its commissioned manholes.</li>

<p><strong>Analysis:</strong></p>
<p>India’s decision to <strong>join the SCO was driven by its economic significance</strong>, regional security concerns, and the opportunity to engage with Central Asian markets and resources. However, the SCO summit initially planned as an <strong>in-person event but later turned into a virtual summit</strong>, may have been impacted by various factors, including the Prime Minister’s U.S. State visit and concerns over tensions with China and Pakistan. With India’s SCO chairpersonship ending, it is feared, there may be a sense of diminishing returns from its engagement with the SCO</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Despite the constraints of SCO, the present outcomes highlight the significance of India’s chairing of the summit, the expansion of SCO membership, cooperation on key issues, and India’s stance on regional security concerns.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Example 1:</strong> Warming temperatures <strong>decay the pheromones</strong> used by some ant species, making it difficult for them to follow trails.</li>
<li><strong>Example 2:</strong> Rising CO₂ levels in water affect the evasion abilities of water fleas, while coral reef damselfish lose their ability to recognize predators.</li>
<li><strong>Example 3:</strong> Climate change-associated stressors disrupt chemical interactions across entire ecosystems, with implications for disease-causing pathogens and their hosts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding these impacts is essential for mitigating the effects of climate change on communication and preserving ecological balance.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The SC has taken on board a plea to stop using religious identity as a criterion to afford or deny communities a place within the Scheduled Caste bracket.</p>
<p><strong>The petition:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Has challenged <strong>the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order 1950</strong> issued under <strong>Article 341(1)</strong> of the Constitution.<ul>
<li><strong>Article 341 (1)</strong> authorises the President to declare certain castes and classes as Scheduled Castes in a State (after consultation with the Governor) or a UT.</li>
<li><strong>The 1950 Order</strong> mandates that anybody who is not a Hindu, Sikh or Buddhist cannot be granted Scheduled Caste status.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Since the word ‘religion’ does not even exist in Article 341(1), the ban concerning Christians and Muslims in the 1950 Order should be deleted.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scheduled caste status for Dalit converts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Justice Ranganath Mishra Commission</strong> (2007) recommended that Scheduled Caste reservation be provided for Dalit converts to Christianity and Islam. <strong>The Centre had rejected the report.</strong></li>
<li><strong>A new Commission</strong> (under <strong>G. Balakrishnan)</strong> was established in 2022 to report on the question of granting SC status to persons who have historically belonged to the SC but have converted to religions other than Hinduism, Buddhism and Sikhism.</li>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/quasar-black-holes-time-dilation-8707635/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Scientists conducted a <strong>study using observations of quasars, powerful black holes, to demonstrate “time dilation” in the early universe</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The study showed that <strong>time passed only about a fifth as quickly as it does today</strong>, around 12.3 billion years ago when the universe was much younger.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Quasars:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Quasars are <strong>tremendously active supermassive black holes</strong> millions to billions of <strong>times more massive than our sun,</strong> usually <strong>residing at centres of galaxies</strong>.</li>
<li>They <strong>devour matter drawn to them by their immense gravitational pull and unleash torrents of radiation</strong> including jets of high-energy particles, while a glowing disk of matter spins around them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This supports Einstein’s theory of relativity, <strong>which states that time and space are intertwined and that the universe has been expanding since the Big Bang</strong>.</li>
<li>Time dilation means that if <strong>one could travel back to that time, a second would still feel like a second, but from the perspective of a person today, a second back then would unfold in five seconds</strong>. This study adds to <strong>previous evidence of time dilation based on observations of supernovas, and it highlights the complexity of time in modern physics.</strong></li>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: A recent study suggests that the <strong>colossal and mysterious “Gravity Hole”</strong> in <strong>the Indian Ocean</strong> may be the <strong>remnants of an ancient sea that disappeared millions of years ago.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is Gravity Hole?</strong></p>
<p>A “Gravity Hole” refers to a <strong>large gravity anomaly</strong>, an area where gravity is significantly different from the surrounding regions. It is characterized by a substantial decrease in gravitational pull compared to the expected value based on the Earth’s normal gravitational field.</p>
<p>The causes of gravity holes can vary, <strong>including geological structures, variations in mass distribution, or other factors that affect the gravitational field</strong> in a particular area.</p>
<p>The phenomenon is estimated to have <strong>formed approximately 20 million years ago and is expected to endure for millions more.</strong></p>
<p><strong>More about the News:</strong> </p>
<p>The Gravity Hole is a <strong>massive region in the Indian Ocean</strong>, about 1,200 kilometres southwest of the southernmost tip of India, and has such a <strong>low pull of gravity that the sea level of the Indian Ocean over the “hole”</strong> is around 106 metres below the global average. This pronounced dip in the ocean is called <strong>Indian Ocean geoid low (IOGL)</strong> and was discovered in 1948</p>
<ul>
<li>Known as the <strong>Indian Ocean geoid low (IOGL),</strong> this vast depression spans <strong>over 2 million square miles and lies more than 600 miles beneath the Earth’s crust.</strong></li>
<li>The study proposes that the <strong>IOGL consists of slabs from the Tethys Ocean</strong>, which was a sea that separated the supercontinents of Gondwana and Laurasia.</li>
<li>The Tethys Ocean is believed to have i<strong>nfluenced the African Large Low Shear Velocity province,</strong> generating <strong>plumes beneath the Indian Ocean</strong>.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Tomato growers in Maharashtra and Karnataka have reported crop losses due to attacks by <strong>two different viruses: the cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) in Maharashtra and the tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) in Karnataka</strong> and other South Indian states.</p>
<ul>
<li>Both viruses belong to different viral families and spread through different means.</li>
<li>ToMV primarily spreads through <strong>infected seeds, saplings, and agricultural tools, while CMV is transmitted by aphids</strong>.</li>
<li>High temperatures followed by <strong>intermittent rain create favourable conditions for CMV spread.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Controlling these viruses involves following <strong>biosafety standards, treating seeds, discarding infected material, and practising good agricultural practices</strong>. CMV has a <strong>wide range of hosts, making control more challenging, while ToMV can remain dormant in weeds and plant remains.</strong></p>
