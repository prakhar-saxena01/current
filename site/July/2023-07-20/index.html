<p><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Mechanisms, Laws, Institutions and Bodies constituted for the Protection and Betterment of these Vulnerable Sections</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/rajasthan-minimum-income-bill-provisions-what-makes-it-unique-8849170/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: The Rajasthan Minimum Guaranteed Income Bill 2023 has been recently tabled by the Rajasthan government.</p>
<p><strong>About the Bill:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> In order to provide individuals or households with a minimal additional guaranteed income in the form of a guaranteed wage/pension, the bill would establish entitlement-based social security.</p>
<p><strong>Salient provisions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minimum guaranteed income:</strong><ul>
<li>Each adult citizen of the state has been guaranteed <strong>a minimum income for 125 days a year</strong>.</li>
<li>This will be provided through two schemes,<ul>
<li><strong>In the urban areas</strong> through the Rajasthan government’s flagship Indira Gandhi Shahri Rozgar Guarantee Yojana.</li>
<li><strong>In the rural areas</strong> through the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Guaranteed employment:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>The minimum wages</strong> should be paid weekly or in any case not later than a fortnight <strong>to ensure the right to employment.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Program Officers</strong> (BDO in rural and an Executive Officer of the local body in urban areas) shall ensure that the work site is <strong>within a radius of 5 Km</strong> of where the job card is registered.</li>
<li>The applicant is entitled to an <strong>unemployment allowance</strong> if the program officer fails to offer work within 15 days of receiving the application.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Guaranteed social security pension:</strong> The government will provide eligible categories (aged, disabled, widows, and single women) with <strong>a minimum pension of Rs 1,000</strong>, which will be <strong>increased at the rate of 15% each year.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance of the Bill:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Bill contains many firsts in the country. <strong>For example,</strong> guaranteeing minimum employment and pensions by law distinguishes it from cash transfer schemes.</li>
<li>The Bill is part of a bouquet of schemes and measures undertaken by the Rajasthan government <strong>to combat inflation with an eye on the polls later this year.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges towards implementation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identification of eligible beneficiaries</strong> with minimum inclusion and exclusion errors.</li>
<li><strong>Financial burden</strong>, as the government anticipates an additional expenditure of Rs 2,500 crore per year, which may increase with time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The true measure of any society can be found in how it treats its most vulnerable members (Gandhiji).</li>
<li>It is therefore a <strong>moral responsibility</strong> of every government to ensure the welfare of vulnerable/ disadvantaged people.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="gs-paper-2"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>International Relations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/c-raja-mohan-writes-from-great-powers-to-asia-india-is-raising-its-diplomatic-game-8847139/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Indian PM’s decision to stop in Cairo (Egypt) on his way back from Washington and Abu Dhabi (UAE) as he came home from Paris suggests India is looking for greater engagement in Africa, Asia and the waters (Indo-Pacific) that connect them.</p>
<p><strong>Other similar engagements:</strong> India’s External Affairs Minister is currently engaging (in Jakarta and Bangkok) with –</p>
<ul>
<li>The Association of South East Asian Nations (<strong>ASEAN</strong>),</li>
<li>The ASEAN “plus one” meeting,</li>
<li>The East Asia Summit (<strong>EAS</strong>),</li>
<li>The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF),</li>
<li>The Forum for Mekong Ganga Cooperation (<strong>MGC</strong>), and</li>
<li>The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (<strong>BIMSTEC</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The focus of these engagements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>India’s neighbourhood figured prominently</strong>:<ul>
<li>For example, the Indian PM and French President <strong>issued a declaration on the Indo-Pacific Roadmap</strong> for wide-ranging cooperation in countries of <strong>Africa, the Indian Ocean Region, South Asia, Southeast Asia and the Pacific.</strong></li>
<li>Similarly, the joint statement issued by the Indian PM and the US President included a section on the strategic collaboration in the Indo-Pacific through the <strong>Quad</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>To boost cooperation in bilateral, plurilateral and multilateral arrangements:</strong> Like the Indian Ocean Rim Association, the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium, the Indian Ocean Commission, the Djibouti Code of Conduct, and the ASEAN-led institutions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why are these engagements not business as usual in Indian diplomacy?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>India’s relations with its Asian neighbourhood</strong> since independence were <strong>treated as separate</strong> from Delhi’s engagement with the great powers.<ul>
<li>It was based on the proposition that India must keep the major powers out of the region <strong>to create an “area of peace” in Asia.</strong></li>
<li>However, Delhi neither had the power to stop the great powers from coming into the region nor prevent its Asian neighbours from aligning with outside powers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The main criterion for membership in the <strong>non-aligned movement (NAM)</strong> is that NAM members should not have deep military-strategic cooperation with great powers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implications of these policies:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Violated the essence of international politics</strong> – the sovereign will protect themselves with whatever resources s/he can mobilise and can’t put ideology ahead of survival.</li>
<li>Delhi also ignored that most threats to a sovereign arise from <strong>problems with neighbours</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When did things start changing?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After the end of the Cold War and the new compulsions on India to liberalise its economy.</li>
<li><strong>India’s new focus</strong> was on trade and investment and connectivity in relations with its neighbours in Asia that were long neglected.</li>
<li><strong>Delhi also broke the rule of keeping political distance</strong> from the major powers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What led to recent changes in Indian diplomacy?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deterioration in India-China relations:</strong><ul>
<li>As a result, Delhi embraced the Indo-Pacific framework and the <strong>Quad</strong> initiated by Japan and supported by the US in East Asia.</li>
<li><strong>To the West</strong>, India joined Israel, UAE, and the US to launch the so-called <strong>I2U2 forum</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>India’s strategic partnership with the Western powers is rising</strong> compared to its engagement with <strong>Russia and China.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Delhi now takes an <strong>integrated view of its interests</strong> and pursues them through new and cross-cutting forums (for example, the Quad and the ASEAN are seen as complementary to each other).</li>
<li>As India becomes a major economic entity with significant geopolitical force, its ability to shape the intersection between its extended neighbourhood and the world will rapidly grow.</li>

<h4 id="gs-paper-3"><strong>GS Paper 3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Issues relating to Poverty and Hunger/ Growth and development</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/an-economy-more-future-ready-8847102/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> India’s current per capita income is <strong>$2,379 in 2022-23.</strong> The goal is to raise it by almost six times <strong>in the next 25 years</strong>, leading to a higher standard of living and poverty eradication. To achieve this vision, understanding the challenges and taking appropriate actions are essential.</p>
<p><strong>Current achievements of India in poverty reduction:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>415 million</strong> poor people moved out of poverty from 2005/2006 to 2019/2021 (from 645 to 230 million). (<a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/12/multidimensional-poverty-index/#:~:text=In%202005%2F2006%2C%20about%20645,%2F2006%20to%202019%2F2021.">Global MPI</a>)</li>
<li>India has registered a <strong>decline</strong> in the number of multidimensionally poor from <strong>24.</strong><strong>85% in 2015-16 to 14.96% in 2019-2021.</strong> (<a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/19/national-multidimensional-poverty-index/#:~:text=Key%20highlights%3A,seven%20Indians%20is%20multidimensionally%20poor.">National MPI</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges that the country will face in economic development and subsequent poverty reduction:</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the global front:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ukraine-Russia conflict:</strong> The overall climate for peace, which is necessary for growth, has deteriorated after the conflict.<ul>
<li><strong>Supply disruptions</strong> of critical imports like oil can cause a severe setback not only to developing countries but also to developed countries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The attitude of some countries towards global trade:</strong> Rich countries that earlier preached to the developing countries to adopt a free trade model, are putting restrictions on imports.<ul>
<li>This is happening when developing countries like India are reaching the stage of being able to compete in the world market.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>At the domestic</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>State of Indian economy:</strong><ul>
<li>In the past 75 years, India has built a reasonably strong and diversified economy.</li>
<li>Though India is today the 5th largest economy, it is <strong>ranked (2022) 149 out of 194 countries in per capita terms.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Export-led growth strategy:</strong> Several countries (South Korea, China, etc) achieved high growth over several decades by focusing on exports.<ul>
<li><strong>This export-led growth strategy may not work for India</strong>, particularly in the context of a changed global trade situation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Adoption of new technologies:</strong> India’s ability to absorb new technologies like <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> (AI) will have ramifications for the industrial structure and employment.<ul>
<li><strong>AI can result in increasing productivity and output but not necessarily jobs.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Impact on output because of environmental considerations</strong>: Bringing down pollution can have an output effect. In this context, <strong>a high annual growth rate of 8% may have to be ruled out.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Provision for basic income</strong>:<ul>
<li>In an uncertain world, the need for the provision of basic income becomes even more urgent.</li>
<li>However, there are many issues connected with basic income (<strong>level and coverage</strong>) which need to be resolved.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Actions India needs to overcome these challenges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A multi-dimensional strategy</strong>:<ul>
<li>The emphasis should be on agriculture and related activities, manufacturing and exports.</li>
<li>India needs to preserve its achievements and move forward in the services area.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Raising the per capita income:</strong> By almost six times from $2,379 in 2022-23 over the next 25 years.</li>
<li><strong>Reorienting the educational system:</strong> This will enable students to acquire the required skills.</li>
<li><strong>Identify labour-intensive economic activities</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>For implementing the provision of basic income</strong>, beneficiaries have to be determined taking into account certain normative considerations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Potential implications of the above actions:</strong> These will enable people to have a higher <strong>standard of living</strong>,  <strong>reduce inequality and eliminate poverty.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Despite challenges, a 6 to 7% sustained growth and better job prospects are still possible if the growth strategy is correct and if an appropriate investment climate can be created.</p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-3_1"><strong>GS Paper 3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Conservation, environmental pollution and degradation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/water/india-s-farmers-need-financial-motivation-to-check-indiscriminate-use-of-groundwater-for-irrigation-90702"><strong>DTE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> There is a need to urgently address the pressure on groundwater resources, starting with irrigation water use.</p>
<p><strong>Groundwater situation in India:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/water_facts.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/water_facts.png" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Concerns:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>India is the largest user of groundwater in the world</strong>, extracting more than the two largest economies, the United States and China, together.</li>
<li><strong>Growing domestic, industrial and agricultural demand</strong> is increasing the stress on groundwater resources. <strong>For example,</strong><ul>
<li>India is dangerously falling under the category of a water-scarce country.</li>
<li><strong>India gets 1,486 cubic metres</strong> (1 cubic metre = 1,000 litres) <strong>per capita</strong> of freshwater every year.</li>
<li>A country is officially water-scarce when the per capita availability is less than 1,000 cubic metres per annum.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Climate change is adding to the problem</strong> and may have far-reaching implications, including threats to food security, increased conflicts and mass migration, if not addressed timely.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Interplay between groundwater stress and Agriculture:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Over 60% of irrigation requirements are met by groundwater.</strong><ul>
<li>Since the 1980s, <strong>around 77% of the total addition</strong> to irrigation in the northwestern plains has come from <strong>tubewells</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>This has introduced new crops (water-guzzlers) in non-traditional areas</strong>, for example, paddy in Punjab (the area under rice increased from <strong>47 to 80%</strong> of the total cropped area between 1970s-2019) and Haryana.</li>
<li><strong>This has also increased cropping intensity</strong> by expanding cultivation in the largely dry winter and summer seasons.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implications of changing crop patterns:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Created a crisis by depleting groundwater at an alarming rate</strong> and deteriorating soil-human health.</li>
<li>Affecting crop diversity. <strong>For example</strong>, paddy in Punjab has practically wiped out oilseeds and pulses, maize and cotton.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is aiding this?</strong> Water and electricity policies (subsidy) are often considered the main drivers of growth in the area under rice.</p>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Storing and using rainwater:</strong> India receives 4,000 billion cubic metres (BCM) of freshwater annually through precipitation, but only 1,123 BCM is used currently.</li>
<li><strong>Effective management of surface water resources</strong> in regions where surface irrigation is available.</li>
<li><strong>Energy and water pricing</strong> can be an effective policy remedy for diversifying cropping patterns and checking depleting groundwater.<ul>
<li>However, this may be less effective, as farmers may switch to <strong>alternative energy</strong> sources (solar pumping).</li>
<li>Also, irrigation water pricing in India is <strong>non-volumetric</strong> and mainly applies to canal-sourced systems, depending on the area and type of crops grown.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Encouraging farmers</strong> to sell surplus solar energy by increasing the tariff.</li>
<li><strong>Using water metres</strong> for irrigation water pricing to assess the actual volume of water used. This will encourage water conservation through its efficient use.</li>

<p>The Ministry of Culture and the Indian Navy have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to revive the <strong>ancient stitched shipbuilding method</strong>, also known as the Tankai method.</p>
<p><strong>What is Tankai Method?</strong></p>
<p>The Tankai method is an ancient shipbuilding technique that involves stitching wooden planks together to construct ships, rather than using nails. This method offers flexibility and durability to the ships, making them less susceptible to damage from shoals and sandbars.</p>
<p><strong>This 2000-year-old shipbuilding technique</strong> will be preserved and brought back to life.</p>
<p><strong>Significance</strong>: The revival of the stitched shipbuilding method is vital for <strong>preserving India’s rich maritime heritage and cultural history</strong>. Furthermore, it aims to promote cultural memories and strengthen ties with Indian Ocean littoral countries.</p>
<p><strong>Usage</strong>: The example can be used in Essay/Indian Arts and Culture questions to showcase the exceptional craftsmanship of traditional shipbuilders in India.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> As global temperatures rise, fires are spreading farther north and into the Arctic, leading to a rise in <strong>“zombie fires</strong>.”</p>
<p><strong>What are Zombie Fires?</strong> </p>
<p>Zombie fires are <strong>underground wildfires that smoulder beneath the surface, burning slowly</strong> and releasing large amounts of smoke. They can persist through winter, reemerging in the following spring. These fires are <strong>difficult to detect and extinguish</strong>, making them a challenging firefighting task. Zombie fires occur in <strong>carbon-rich peatlands</strong> and can have significant environmental impacts, contributing to climate change and air pollution.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for it:</strong></p>
<p>The Arctic’s <strong>warming conditions make the forest and tundra more susceptible to wildfires</strong>, and changes in atmospheric circulation, including <strong>more frequent lightning strikes</strong>, contribute to fire outbreaks.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/climate_ch.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/climate_ch.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p>The increasing prevalence of zombie fires underscores the urgent need to address climate change and its impact on wildfire risks.</p>
<p><strong>Related Term:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Zombie ice, also known as “polar ice zombie,”</strong> is a term used to describe Arctic or Antarctic ice that appears to be melting and disappearing during the warmer months but later reappears and refreezes during the colder months. However, the ice is no longer getting replenished by parent glaciers</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: The <strong>Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT)</strong> has implemented the Advance Authorisation Scheme under the <strong>Foreign Trade Policy</strong>, which <strong>allows duty-free import of inputs for export purposes</strong>. The eligibility of inputs is <strong>determined by Sector-specific Norms Committees based on input-output norms.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To streamline the norms fixation process, <strong>the DGFT has created a user-friendly and searchable database of Ad-hoc Norms fixed in previous years</strong>. These norms can be used by any exporter without requiring a <strong>Norms Committee review</strong>, as outlined in the <strong>Foreign Trade Policy 2023.</strong></li>
<li>This trade facilitation measure <strong>simplifies the advance authorisation and norms fixation process, leading to shorter turnaround times for exporters, improved ease of doing business, and reduced compliance burden.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Advance Authorization Scheme:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It allows the <strong>duty-free import of inputs, which are physically incorporated into an export product</strong>.</li>
<li>In addition to any <strong>inputs, packaging material, fuel, oil, and catalyst which is consumed/utilized in the process of production of export product</strong>, is also allowed.</li>
<li>DGFT provides a <strong>sector-wise list of Standard Input-Output Norms (SION)</strong>under which the exporters may choose to apply.</li>
<li>Advance Authorization is <strong>valid for 12 months from the date of issue of such Authorization</strong>.</li>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: The <strong>Western Ghats, a biodiversity hotspot in India</strong>, is home to <strong>62 Desiccation-Tolerant (DT) Vascular plant species</strong>, capable of surviving extreme dehydration <strong>by losing up to 95% of their water content and reviving when water becomes available again.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This unique ability <strong>allows them to thrive in harsh, arid environments that would be unsuitable for most other plants.</strong> These DT plants have potential <strong>applications in agriculture, especially in water-scarce regions.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The study highlights that DT plants are <strong>predominantly found in rock outcrops, a common landscape feature in the Western Ghats, but they also inhabit tree trunks in partially shaded forests</strong>.</li>
<li>Of the 62 species identified, <strong>16 are exclusive to India, and 12 are unique to the Western Ghats outcrops, emphasizing the area’s significance as a global DT hotspot.</strong></li>
