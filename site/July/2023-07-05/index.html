<h4 id="gs-paper-2"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus: Indian Constitution</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/push-for-uniform-civil-code-comes-even-as-supreme-court-is-yet-to-decide-the-ambit-and-scope-of-religious-freedom/article67031537.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The push for a Uniform Civil Code is raising concerns about religious rights and personal laws, as the Supreme Court’s inquiry on religious freedom remains unresolved.</p>
<p><strong>What is UCC?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Uniform Civil Code</strong> refers to the proposition of <strong>having a uniform set of civil laws for all citizens of a country, irrespective of their religious or cultural affiliations</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The principle behind UCC:</strong></p>
<p>The concept of a UCC is <strong>rooted in the idea of equality and uniformity before the law</strong> and it <strong>aims to replace the personal laws based on religious practices that currently govern matters such as marriage, divorce, inheritance, adoption, and succession.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Historical Perspectives on UCC</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>British rule</strong>: There was a <strong>lack of uniformity in civil matter</strong>s as <strong>personal laws based on religious customs and traditions</strong> were <strong>recognized for different communities</strong>. The idea of a UCC emerged as a <strong>response to this fragmentation and as a means to promote a common civil identity.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Portuguese rule</strong>: <strong>When Goa was under Portuguese rule until 1961, a Uniform Civil Code</strong> based on the <strong>Portuguese Napoleonic code</strong> was implemented.</li>
<li><strong>Nehruvian Vision:</strong> Jawaharlal Nehru envisioned a <strong>modern and progressive India</strong> and saw the <strong>UCC as an essential element of nation-building</strong>. He believed that a UCC would <strong>help eliminate divisions based on religion and promote equality among citizens.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Hindu Code Bill</strong>: The Hindu Code Bill sought to <strong>codify and modernize Hindu personal laws relating to marriage, divorce, adoption, and inheritance.</strong> It was seen as a <strong>step towards a UCC, as it aimed to bring uniformity in personal laws within the Hindu community.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Shah Bano Case:</strong> The Supreme Court judgment, in this case, sparked debates on the need for a <strong>UCC to ensure gender justice and equal rights for women across religious communities</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Constitutional Perspectives on UCC</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Constituent Assembly Debates</strong>: During the framing of the Indian Constitution, the debates witnessed diverse viewpoints, with <strong>some members advocating for a UCC as a way to promote gender equality and secularism, while others expressed concerns about preserving religious and cultural rights.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Directive Principles of State Policy: Article 44</strong> of the Indian constitution states that the <strong>state shall endeavour to secure for its citizens a uniform civil code throughout the territory of India.</strong></p>
</li>
<li><strong>Secularism</strong>: The Indian Constitution enshrines the principle of secularism, which mandates the <strong>separation of religion and the state</strong>. A <strong>UCC is seen as a way to promote secularism</strong> by ensuring equal treatment of all citizens irrespective of their religious affiliations.</li>
<li><strong>Equality and Non-Discrimination:</strong> The Constitution of India guarantees <strong>equality before the law under Article 14,</strong> and prohibits <strong>discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth.</strong> UCC would uphold these principles by <strong>ensuring equal rights and equal treatment for all citizens, regardless of their religious backgrounds.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Gender Justice:</strong> The Constitution also guarantees the <strong>right to equality and the right against discrimination based on gender.</strong> A UCC is seen as a means to promote <strong>gender justice</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How do Personal laws govern different communities?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>The implementation of a <strong>Uniform Civil Code (UCC) in India</strong> requires a balanced approach that respects <strong>multiculturalism and diversity</strong>. Inclusive discussions with stakeholders, including <strong>religious leaders and legal experts</strong>, are essential to ensure diverse perspectives are considered. The focus should be on <strong>eliminating practices that hinder equality and gender justice while avoiding reactive culturalism</strong>. The reform process of Muslim Personal Law should be led by the Muslim clergy, and Muslims should critically examine practices to promote equality and justice. The aim is to develop a <strong>just and inclusive UCC that upholds constitutional values.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Quotes related to UCC:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>“The implementation of a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) will promote the integration of India by establishing a shared platform for diverse communities”</em></strong> </li>
<li><strong><em>“The Uniform Civil Code may potentially enforce a code that is influenced by Hindu practices in all communities”</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>“It is imperative to ensure that certain groups or marginalised segments of society are not subjected to disadvantageous treatment during this endeavour”</em></strong></li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Quadripartite – comprising the FAO, UNEP, WHO and the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) – released the One Health Priority Research Agenda on <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/02/antimicrobial-resistance-heres-what-can-be-done-to-address-environmental-amr-in-india/">Antimicrobial Resistance</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The agenda defines</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/05/06/insights-into-editorial-a-one-health-approach-that-targets-people-animals/"><strong>‘One Health’</strong></a><strong>:</strong> The concept acknowledges the <strong>health of humans, domestic and wild animals, plants, and the larger environment</strong>, including ecosystems, are inextricably linked and interdependent.</p>
<p><strong>The link between ‘One Health’ and AMR:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>At this One Health interface, addressing global health issues necessitates <strong>a multisectoral, multidisciplinary response to AMR</strong>.</li>
<li>Using a mixed-methods approach, global experts identified five key pillars as well as three cross-cutting themes, as follows:</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/transmision.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/transmision.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Five key pillars:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transmission:</strong> This pillar focuses on the environment, plant, animal, and human sectors where AMR transmission, circulation and spread occur.</li>
<li><strong>Integrated surveillance:</strong> This pillar aims to identify cross-cutting priority research questions in order to improve common technical understanding and information exchange among One Health stakeholders.</li>
<li><strong>Interventions:</strong> This pillar focuses on programmes, practises, tools, and activities aimed at preventing, containing, or reducing the incidence, prevalence, and spread of AMR.</li>
<li><strong>Behavioural insights and change:</strong> It focuses on research addressing human behaviour that affects AMR, including ways to combat it.</li>
<li><strong>Economics and policy:</strong> This pillar takes into account the cost-effectiveness of an AMR investment case, financial sustainability, and long-term financial impact.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Purpose of priority research agenda:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To better advocate for <strong>increased research and investment</strong> in antimicrobial resistance (AMR).</li>
<li><strong>To guide a variety of stakeholders</strong> in generating new evidence to address AMR, with a focus on low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).</li>
<li>The agenda also <strong>emphasises the importance of developing research capacity in LMICs</strong>, which will be critical for addressing research gaps and developing evidence.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance of the agenda:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It will serve as <strong>a guide for countries, research institutes and funding bodies</strong> to support One Health AMR research.</li>
<li>It will also <strong>allow policymakers, researchers</strong>, and the multidisciplinary scientific community to collaborate across sectors.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other similar efforts:</strong> WHO also launched a global research agenda for AMR in human health, <strong>prioritising 40 research topics for evidence generation</strong> to inform policy and interventions by 2030.</p>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong> The priority research agenda requires <strong>contextualisation</strong> at the regional and country level and the development of specific research relevant to the needs of different countries and One Health settings.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Implementing this research agenda will address the threat of AMR and support the national action plan (NAP) implementation and achievement of the SDGs for 2030.</p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-3"><strong>GS Paper 3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Environment and Conservation/ Science and Technology- Developments and their Applications and Effects in Everyday Life.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/climate-change/us-government-considers-controversial-solar-geoengineering-to-counter-global-warming-report-90364"><strong>DTE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The US is eyeing a controversial tool to counter global warming: <strong>Solar geoengineering</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>What is Solar geoengineering?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Solar geoengineering, also referred to as <strong>solar radiation management</strong> (SRM) describes a set of proposed approaches to <strong>reflect sunlight (back to space) to rapidly cool the Earth</strong>.</li>
<li>Within solar geoengineering, researchers are considering two main approaches.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Different SRM methods:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/solar_climate.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/solar_climate.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI):</strong> It involves injecting tiny reflecting particles, known as aerosols, into the upper atmosphere to cool the planet.</li>
<li><strong>Marine cloud brightening (MCB):</strong> It would use sea salt to stimulate cloud formation over the ocean, which would also help reflect sunlight in the region.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why is solar geoengineering being considered?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Paris Agreement’s target</strong> requires limiting global temperature increase well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C.</li>
<li>For this, nations <strong>need to bring net global CO2 emissions to zero by no later than mid-century</strong>.</li>
<li>Despite these ambitious goals, <strong>solar geoengineering is being considered</strong> to prepare for the possibility that global efforts may fall short.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The USA’s plan:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The White House stated that <strong>public or private actors could carry out activities such as injecting aerosols and MCB</strong> to reflect more sunlight into space.</li>
<li>It called for <strong>research to enable better-informed decisions</strong> about the potential risks and benefits of the tool as part of its climate policy, in addition to mitigation and adaptation.</li>
<li>This comes amid concerns raised by the experts over the <strong>high environmental</strong> (changes in precipitation patterns, ozone amounts, sea-level rise, ocean acidification, etc)<strong>, social, and geopolitical risks</strong> that come with SRM.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Solar geoengineering risks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Moral hazard:</strong> The danger is that the technology will become an excuse to slow emissions reductions and stop moving toward a low-carbon economy.</li>
<li><strong>Little is known about its impacts:</strong> Research to scope the risks and potential of solar geoengineering has mostly been conducted through computer-based modelling and natural observations (volcanic eruption).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong> Because solar geoengineering has global implications, its consideration as a climate response requires <strong>–</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Effective international governance</strong>/ Mechanisms for oversight.</li>
<li><strong>Outdoor experimentation</strong> and funding for experiments should come only from governments.</li>
<li><strong>Ways to involve the public in decision-making.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Given the ethical and environmental risks these activities can present, atmospheric experiments to assess these technologies deserve <strong>timely public scrutiny and debate.</strong></li>
<li>Even as researchers assess the potential feasibility and effectiveness of geoengineering approaches, <strong>mitigation and adaptation must remain our first-line solutions.</strong></li>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/pressreleases/iaea-finds-japans-plans-to-release-treated-water-into-the-sea-at-fukushima-consistent-with-international-safety-standards"><strong>IAEA</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has conducted a safety review and concluded that Japan’s plans to release treated water from the <strong>Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station into the sea</strong> are consistent with international safety standards.</p>
<p><strong>Background of the event:</strong></p>
<p>In 2011, a <strong>major nuclear accident occurred at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station</strong> in Japan following a <strong>massive earthquake and tsunami</strong>. The natural disaster led to a <strong>loss of power and cooling system failures</strong>, resulting in the meltdowns of <strong>three reactors</strong> and the release of <strong>radioactive materials</strong>. It was one of the most significant nuclear accidents since the <strong>Chornobyl disaster in 1986.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Water Treatment:</strong></p>
<p>Water stored at the site got contaminated during the incident. The contaminated water had caesium and strontium. They were removed periodically and now the water has been treated through an <strong>Advanced Liquid Processing System (ALPS)</strong> to remove almost all radioactivity, aside <strong>from tritium</strong>. Before discharging, Japan will <strong>dilute the water to bring the tritium</strong> to below regulatory standards.</p>

<p><strong>About IAEA:</strong></p>
<p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (HQ: Vienna; founded: 1957) is an <strong>intergovernmental organization</strong> that seeks to promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy and to inhibit its use for any military purpose, including nuclear weapons.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong></p>
<p>The IAEA strengthens the <strong>global nuclear safety and security framework</strong>. It identifies and promotes best practices and safety standards and implements programs to assist states in applying these standards. The IAEA is also a <strong>key player in the effort to prevent nuclear terrorism.</strong></p>
