<h4 id="gs-paper-2"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Bilateral, Regional and Global Groupings Affecting India’s Interests</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/india-as-a-quad-led-biomanufacturing-hub/article66878203.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> In order to give the necessary fillip to enhance <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/international-relations/bilateral-regional-and-global-groupings-and-agreements-involving-india-and-or-affecting-indias-interests/indo-pacific/quad/">Quad cooperation</a> in biotechnology, India should be an ideal choice for the establishment of a <strong>Quad-led biomanufacturing hub.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/QUAD.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/QUAD.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In <strong>2021</strong>, the Quad set up a <strong>Critical and Emerging Technology Working Group</strong> to facilitate cooperation related to developments in critical and emerging technologies, including <strong>biotechnology</strong>.</li>
<li>However, the Quad countries do not collaborate enough in biotechnology yet.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Biomanufacturing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> It uses living systems, particularly microorganisms and cell cultures, to produce molecules and materials on a commercial scale.</li>
<li><strong>Potential:</strong><ul>
<li>It can transform the global industrial system, with up to 60% of physical inputs to the global economy.</li>
<li>Countries like the <strong>US and China</strong> have designed specific policies to shape their bio-economies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Case of India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/06/29/sansad-tv-perspective-indias-biotech-sector/"><strong>The National Biotechnology Development Strategy</strong></a> envisions the country as a “Global Biomanufacturing Hub” by 2025.</li>
<li>While the strategy sets a target of <strong>$100 billion for the hub</strong>, it is important to recognize that India’s ambitions require <strong>external support.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>India’s strengths:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Existing infrastructure, pharmaceutical manufacturing expertise, and <strong>skilled manpower</strong>.</li>
<li>India is among the <strong>top performers</strong> in the field of biomanufacturing in both the quality of research and research publications.</li>
<li>India also has <strong>significant potential in low-cost biomanufacturing</strong> (33% lower than the U.S.), particularly in the production of enzymes, reagents, research materials, and equipment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>India <strong>still requires significant capability and capacity uplifts</strong> to become a world leader.</li>
<li><strong>China</strong> has expressed its intention to capture this market, similar to how it dominated small-molecule <strong>active pharmaceutical ingredients</strong> (APIs).</li>
<li>Such dependence on the biomanufacturing sector will be <strong>detrimental to both India and the Quad.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How does Quad complement these strengths?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The U.S.</strong> has significant funding capability.</li>
<li><strong>Japan, Australia and the U.S.</strong> possess advanced biotechnology innovation ecosystems and intellectual property.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advantages of the proposed hub for India and Quad:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Can help facilitate technology transfer,</li>
<li>Connect investors,</li>
<li>Establish a biomanufacturing fund that is administered through the Quad,</li>
<li>Support efforts to reduce dependency on China.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead for India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strengthening physical infrastructure.</strong></li>
<li><strong>A scheme</strong> on the line the PLI scheme allocated $2 billion to the pharmaceutical sector to make biopharmaceuticals, APIs, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Boosting the workforce</strong> by enabling access to cutting-edge technology and training, with a focus on commercialising R&amp;D.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The proposed hub in India can <strong>capitalise on the economic potential</strong> of the biomanufacturing industry and <strong>address existing and potential vulnerabilities</strong> in the global system.</li>
<li><strong>Through cross-Quad collaboration</strong>, India may emerge as a major force in the field of biomanufacturing and assist the Quad in competing in this key area.</li>

<p><strong>Highlights of the study:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Since the 1980s, the rate of increase in methane emissions is <strong>higher than ever before.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Methane policies are actions by governments</strong> that explicitly aim to monitor, prevent, or reduce methane emissions from anthropogenic sources.</li>
<li>90% of identified national policies were from three regions: North America, Europe and Asia Pacific.</li>
<li><strong>The policies targeting fossil methane</strong> (coal, oil, and gas) are lower than biogenic methane (released by living organisms).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Concerns:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This trend has emerged <strong>despite readily available solutions to cut methane emissions</strong> from the fossil fuel sector.</li>
<li><strong>Impact of methane mitigation policies on industries</strong> (like agriculture) important to the national economy, energy and food security or rural poverty considerations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>India-specific findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No effective policies</strong> targeting methane emissions from rice cultivation and biomass burning (burning of crop residues).</li>
<li>While policies targeting biomass burning have quite broad coverage, their <strong>implementation remains challenging.</strong><ul>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> the 1997 Coalbed methane policy was ineffective in incentivising coalbed methane production.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The policies should focus on <strong>super emitters</strong>, which are facilities, equipment, and other infrastructure, typically in the fossil-fuel, waste, or agriculture sectors, that emit methane at high rates.</li>
<li>While reducing livestock or rice-production-related emissions is challenging, <strong>India can contribute by reducing emissions associated with coal production.</strong></li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Ukraine-Russia war had a significant impact on sunflower oil consumption in India.</p>
<p><strong>Status of Sunflower Oil:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Globally:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ukraine (the highest producer) and Russia account</strong> for 60% of the world’s sunflower oil production</li>
<li><strong>Other top producers of sunflower oil</strong> globally include <strong>Ukraine, Russia, Argentina, Romania, and Bulgaria</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sunflower oil is the fourth most</strong> consumed edible oil in India, following mustard, soybean, and palm oil.</li>
<li><strong>Domestic production of sunflower</strong> oil has <strong>significantly declined</strong> over the past decade, unlike soybean oil, which has expanded its cultivated area.</li>
<li><strong>India imports a substantial amount of sunflower oil</strong> due to limited domestic production.</li>
<li><strong>Major producers:</strong> Karnataka (highest producer in India); Telangana and Maharashtra</li>
<li><strong>Major Consumer:</strong> Karnataka, Telangana, and Maharashtra</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Sunflower:</strong> </p>
<p>Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), popularly known as “<strong>Surajmukhi</strong>” (it follows the sun by day) is an <strong>annual flowering plant,</strong> native to <strong>North and Central America</strong> but is now cultivated worldwide for its versatile uses. It is known for its <strong>large, bright yellow flowers</strong>.</p>
<p>Sunflowers are relatively <strong>easy to grow</strong> and are <strong>adaptable</strong> to different climates and soil types. They require <strong>full sun exposure and well-drained</strong> soil. They are known for their ability to <strong>extract heavy metals from the soil,</strong> making them useful in <strong>phytoremediation efforts</strong> to clean up polluted areas.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> A recent peer-reviewed study suggests that even low levels of <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/05/06/arsenic-contamination/">arsenic consumption</a>, commonly found in contaminated groundwater in India, can impact cognitive function in children, adolescents, and young adults.</p>
<p><strong>What does the study say:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arsenic exposure</strong> leads to <strong>reduced grey matter in the brain</strong>, affecting concentration, information storage, and switching between tasks.</li>
<li><strong>At the population level</strong>, contamination leads to <strong>increased school failures</strong>, diminished economic productivity, and a higher risk of criminal and antisocial behaviour.</li>
<li><strong>The major factor for contamination</strong>: Arsenic intake from food, primarily through rice consumption; using contaminated groundwater.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Remedy</strong>: Modifying food preparation techniques, <strong>such as cooking rice</strong> in a specific way, can significantly reduce arsenic levels; <strong>promoting piped water access</strong> and installing arsenic removal plants; <strong>encourage extraction from aquifers</strong> (water channels below the ground) that are deeper than 100 m.</p>
<p><strong>About Arsenic:</strong></p>
<p>Arsenic is an <strong>odourless and tasteless metalloid</strong> found naturally in the earth’s crust and groundwater. It is <strong>highly toxic</strong> in its inorganic form and can cause arsenic poisoning. <strong>Arsenicosis</strong>, the accumulation of high levels of arsenic in the body, leads to adverse health effects and can result in <strong>multi-system organ failure and death</strong>. Efforts have been made under the <strong>2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development</strong> to provide safely managed drinking water free of arsenic contamination. <strong>The Jal Jeevan Mission aims</strong> to provide safe drinking water to all households in rural and <strong>urban India by 2024.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> A recent study has proposed <strong>using calcium-41</strong> as a new method for radiometric dating, similar to <strong>carbon-14 dating</strong> but with several advantages.</p>
<p><strong>What is radiocarbon dating?</strong></p>
<p>Radiocarbon dating, <strong>also known as carbon-14 dating</strong>, is a method used to determine the <strong>age of organic materials</strong> that originated from living organisms. It relies on the <strong>radioactive isotope carbon-14</strong>, which is a variant of the <strong>element carbon</strong>. Carbon-14 is unstable and undergoes radioactive decay over time.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations of Carbon-14 dating:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Limited Time Range:</strong> Carbon-14 dating is effective for objects up to approximately 50,000 years old due to the short half-life of carbon-14 (5,700 years).</li>
<li><strong>Contamination Issues:</strong> Contamination from modern carbon sources can affect the accuracy of carbon-14 dating, leading to inaccurate age estimates.</li>
<li><strong>Incomplete Preservation</strong>: Organic materials must be well-preserved to contain sufficient carbon-14 for dating. Poor preservation or exposure to environmental factors can compromise the reliability of carbon-14 dating.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advantages of Calcium-41:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Longer Half-Life:</strong> Calcium-41 has a <strong>much longer half-life of 99,400 years</strong>, allowing for the dating of much older materials compared to carbon-14.</li>
<li><strong>Abundance in Earth’s Crust</strong>: Calcium-41 is found in the Earth’s crust, making it available for dating various geological materials, including fossilized bones and rocks.</li>
<li><strong>Atom Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA):</strong> The technique of ATTA enables the detection of <strong>calcium-41 atoms with high sensitivity</strong> and selectivity, improving the accuracy of dating methods.</li>
<li><strong>Potential for Extension</strong>: The successful application of ATTA to calcium-41 opens the possibility of <strong>using similar techniques for other metal isotopes</strong>, expanding the range of dating methods available.</li>
<li><strong>Earth-Science Applications:</strong> Calcium-41 and ATTA can be used to <strong>study geological processes,</strong> such as determining how long rocks have been covered by ice, providing valuable insights into Earth’s history and climate changes.</li>

<h4 id="facts-for-prelims_2"><strong>Facts for Prelims:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/european-perch-larger-body-size-warm-water/article66873491.ece#:~:text=Scientists%20have%20called%20into%20question,water%20heated%20by%20warm%20pollutants."><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Scientists have disputed the idea that as the planet warms, the bodies of cold-blooded marine species, including fish, will contract.</p>
<p><strong>Conventional understanding</strong>: Warming temperatures lead to smaller body sizes in cold-blooded marine animals, suggesting that they may actually grow larger in response to warmer waters.</p>
<p><strong>The recent study challenges the expectation due to several reasons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Warm water pollution</strong>: The study suggests that warm water pollution, caused by the discharge of warm pollutants, can actually contribute to <strong>the growth of aquatic animals</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Accelerated growth at younger age:</strong> Contrary to previous assumptions, the study found that cold-blooded animals, or ectotherms, experience faster growth at a younger age in warm waters.</li>
<li><strong>Sustained growth throughout life:</strong> The study discovered the positive effect of warmer waters on growth and they continue to experience growth throughout their lives, leading to a larger maximum body size.</li>
<li><strong>Survival trade-off:</strong> While the warmer waters provide favourable conditions for growth, they also come with higher death rates.</li>
<li><strong>Influence of warm water on young populations</strong>: The research revealed that even if the water becomes inhospitable to the fish due to excessive warmth, the growth boost is significant enough to create a larger population of young-and-large fish.</li>
