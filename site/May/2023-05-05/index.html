<h4 id="gs-paper-1"><strong>GS Paper 1</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Important Geophysical Phenomena</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/world-meteorological-organisation-warns-of-el-ni-o-s-development-associated-with-severe-droughts-and-extreme-rain-globally-by-2024-101683138629803.html"><strong>HT</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> According to the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), the world should prepare for the development of <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/15/el-nino-and-monsoon/">El Niño</a>, which is often associated with <strong>increased heat, drought or rainfall</strong> in different parts of the world<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/How-the-2015-16-El-Nino-affected-disease-outbreaks.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/How-the-2015-16-El-Nino-affected-disease-outbreaks.jpg" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/15/el-nino-and-monsoon/"><strong>La Niña</strong></a> has now ended after persisting for three years and the tropical Pacific is currently in an <strong>ENSO-neutral state</strong> (neither El Niño nor La Niña).</li>
<li>There is a <strong>60% chance for a transition from ENSO-neutral to El Niño</strong> during May-July 2023.</li>
<li><strong>2016</strong> was the warmest year on record because of the <strong>confluence of a very powerful El Niño event and global warming.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The typical impacts of El Niño include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increased rainfall</strong> in parts of southern South America, the southern US, the Horn of Africa and central Asia.</li>
<li><strong>Severe droughts</strong> over Australia, Indonesia, and parts of southern Asia.</li>
<li><strong>Warm water</strong> during summer in the northern hemisphere can fuel <strong>hurricanes</strong> in the central/eastern Pacific Ocean and can <strong>hinder hurricane formation in the Atlantic Basin.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Potential threats due to an El Niño event:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A new spike in global heating</strong> will increase the chance of breaking temperature records (in 2024).</li>
<li><strong>50:50 chance</strong> of the global temperature <strong>temporarily reaching 1.5°C</strong> above the pre-industrial era.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Likely impact on India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Normally, El Nino is <strong>good for the northeast monsoon</strong> [Oct-Dec in the peninsular region] but <strong>bad for the southwest monsoon</strong> (dry periods during June-Sept).</li>
<li><strong>The monsoon season</strong> (~70% of India’s annual rainfall) is crucial to India’s agriculture – a lifeline for about 60% of the country’s net cultivated area.</li>
<li>Monsoon <strong>drives farm produce, rural spending</strong>, inflation, jobs, and industrial demand.</li>
<li>Good farm output <strong>checks food inflation, raises rural incomes and helps inject demand</strong> into the economy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenge ahead for India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>IMD forecasted a “<strong>normal</strong>” monsoon at 96% (+/-5%) of the long-period average (LPA is 87 cm for the period of 1971 to 2020).</li>
<li>An unusually cold start to summer <strong>could delay the start of the monsoon season.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead – EW4All:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Early Warnings For All Initiative (EW4All) was formally launched by the UN Secretary-General in November 2022 at the <strong>COP27</strong> meeting in Sharm El-Sheikh.</li>
<li>The Initiative calls for the <strong>whole world to be covered by an early warning system by the end of 2027.</strong></li>

<p><strong>What is SAI20?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The SAI20 Engagement Group of G20 was <strong>established in 2022 during Indonesia’s Presidency of the G20.</strong></li>
<li>The constitution of SAI20 stems from a recognition of the role of SAIs in –<ul>

<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The measurement of the blue economy</strong> is challenging due to conflicting definitions and issues while classifying different sectors and sub-sectors.</li>
<li><strong>Climate change:</strong> Sea-level rise, water temperature, storm surges, cyclones and wave conditions are some of the signs.</li>
<li><strong>Land use changes, sand mining and deforestation</strong> impinge on the coastal ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In the context of India,</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>~15% of India’s coastal areas</strong> have witnessed changes between 1992 and 2018 due to agriculture, depleting forest cover and urbanisation.</li>
<li><strong>The population</strong> living in the country’s coastal areas is expected to rise from 64 million in 2000 to 216 million by 2060.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Two priorities for SAI20 deliberations:</strong> <em>Blue economy</em> and responsible Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p>
<p><strong>What is expected in the blue economy deliberations?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Preparation of technology-driven tools</strong> to assess authorised development in coastal stretches and track marine water quality.</li>
<li><strong>Evolution of globally relevant audit toolkits</strong> for coastal spaces, which include –<ul>
<li>Legal and institutional frameworks,</li>
<li>Compliance with coastal regulations,</li>
<li>Biodiversity conservation,</li>
<li>Capacity building and compliance to SDGs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Disaster-resilient infrastructure along coasts</li>
<li>ICT hubs for early warning systems</li>
<li>The SAI20 audit <strong>toolkits</strong> being prepared under the leadership of the CAG of India will provide a unique opportunity for constructive dialogue to improve the auditing of ocean-based activities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The audit toolkits will help in the <strong>assessment of policy goals</strong>, and resource efficiency while leveraging economic opportunities towards a truly sustainable blue economy-based global development model.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The recent violent clashes in <strong>Manipur are due to longstanding tensions</strong> between hill and valley people, the Meitei demand for ST (Scheduled Tribe) status, and a recent order by the Manipur High Court.</p>

<tr>
<td><strong>Hill-Valley Tensions</strong></td>
<td>The central valley of Manipur (10% of the geographical area) is home to the <strong>Meitei and Meitei Pangals</strong> who constitute roughly <strong>64% of the state’s population</strong>.<br><br>The remaining <strong>90% of the state’s geographical area</strong> comprises hills surrounding the valley, which are home to the recognized tribes, making up about <strong>35% of the state’s population</strong>.<br><br><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/imphal.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/imphal.jpg" /></a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Meitei Demand for ST Status</strong></td>
<td>The <strong>Meitei community (living in the valley) wants to be included</strong> in the <strong>state’s Scheduled Tribes list</strong>. The demand has been led by the Scheduled Tribes Demand Committee of Manipur (STDCM) since 2012. They argue that being left out of the ST list has caused the community to be <strong>victimized without any constitutional safeguards</strong>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Manipur High Court Order</strong></td>
<td>A single judge of the <strong>Manipur High Court</strong> passed an order asking the government to consider the <strong>demand of the Meitei community for ST status</strong>. The order has been opposed by tribal groups in the state.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>The opposition</strong></td>
<td>Both the demand and the order, passed by a single judge of the High Court, have been strongly opposed by groups <strong>representing the state’s tribal communities such as  Kukis and Naga (living in Hills)</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Reason behind opposition</strong></td>
<td>Opposition to the inclusion of the <strong>Meiteis in the Scheduled Tribe (ST)</strong> category by hill tribe in Manipur is due to their <strong>dominant population and political representation</strong> of Meitei (40 out of 60 Assembly constituencies of the state are in the valley), and fear of job loss. Additionally, the <strong>Meitei language is already included in the Constitution</strong>, and sections of the Meitei community are already classified as <strong>Scheduled Castes or Other Backward Classes</strong> with access to opportunities associated with that status.</td>
