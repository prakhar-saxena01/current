<p><strong>Context:</strong> The India-UAE Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) has had a significant impact on bilateral trade between the two countries <strong>since its implementation in May 2022.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is expected to <strong>increase the total value of bilateral trade in goods</strong> to over USD 100 billion and trade in services to over <strong>USD 15 billion within five years</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>India-UAE Trade relations:</strong></p>
<p>United Arab Emirates (UAE) is <strong>India’s 3rd largest trading partner</strong>, after the United States and China, with a bilateral trade turnover of <strong>USD 68 billion</strong> in 2021. The UAE is also the <strong>7th largest investor in India</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>What is a CEPA?</strong></p>
<p>A Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) is a <strong>bilateral or multilateral trade agreement</strong> between countries aimed at <strong>promoting economic cooperation and integration</strong> by reducing barriers to trade and investment.</p>

<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Issues Relating to Poverty and Hunger</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/we-shouldn-t-let-indian-poverty-turn-into-a-great-eternal-mystery-11683222042082.html"><strong>LM</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> There has been no official estimate of poverty in India after 2011-12. However, many private estimates are available.</p>
<p><strong>Poverty estimation in India:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/poverty.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/poverty.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Poverty</strong> can be defined as a condition in which an individual or household lacks the financial resources to afford a basic minimum standard of living.</li>
<li><strong>Reliable estimation</strong> of poverty is the <strong>first step towards eradication</strong> of poverty as it provides input for the design, implementation and monitoring of anti-poverty programmes.</li>
<li><strong>Two critical components of the estimation of poverty in India:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Information on the consumption expenditures</strong>;</li>
<li>These expenditures are evaluated with reference to a given <strong>poverty line.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In 2011, 21.9% <strong>of Indians</strong> were considered to be living below the national poverty line.</li>
<li><strong>Globally, 8%</strong> lived on less than the international poverty line (WB) of <strong>US$1.90 per person per day.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Issues with estimates of poverty in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vary in a wide range:</strong> From as high as 35% of India’s population in 2017-18 (by S. Subramanian) to a low of 1.4% (by Bhalla, Bhasin and Virmani) found for 2019-20.</li>
<li><strong>No clear conclusion/consensus</strong> on whether poverty rose after 2011-12 or fell.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why do these differences arise?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Due to varying consumption expenditure data used.</strong><ul>
<li>A modified version of data (by Bhalla) from the <strong>Consumer Pyramid Household Survey</strong> (CME) shows that poverty has declined in India.</li>
<li>While the <strong>National Statistical Office</strong> (NSO) data (by S. Subramanian) that poverty increased in India.</li>
<li>The only consumption expenditure survey <strong>conducted by NSO in 2017-18 was abandoned</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Due to different poverty lines used:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>The consumption aggregates from the PLFS</strong> estimate poverty at 17.9% in 2020-21, compared with 21.9% in 2011-12.</li>
<li>The latest (Panagariya and More) report a poverty ratio of <strong>32% in 2019-20 and 26% in 2020-21</strong> using the same PLFS consumption data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Good news for India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A consumption expenditure survey is currently underway.</li>
<li>This will update the national accounts and inflation indices.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The new methodology adopted:</strong> The absence of a comparable survey means it won’t help answer what happened to poverty after 2011-12.</li>
<li><strong>No public discussion</strong> on the new methodology.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The discourse on poverty estimation has played an important role in highlighting the living conditions of the poor and the effectiveness of government policy. Thus, the adoption of a scientific methodology that will generate uniform-error-free data is the need of the hour.</p>

<h3 id="the-financial-inclusion-of-women"><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/06/the-financial-inclusion-of-women/">The financial inclusion of women</a></h3>
<h4 id="gs-paper-2_2"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Welfare Schemes for Vulnerable Sections</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/the-financial-inclusion-of-women-is-set-for-a-tech-leap-11683047798440.html"><strong>LM</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> It is challenging to achieve financial inclusion (FI) for women until they actively participate in the formal financial industry.</p>
<p><strong>What is FI?</strong></p>
<p>The process of ensuring access to financial services and timely and adequate credit where needed by vulnerable groups such as weaker sections and low-income groups at an affordable cost. (RBI)</p>
<p><strong>Why do women need FI?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>FI is considered <strong>a critical indicator of development</strong> and is identified as an <strong>enabler for at least eight</strong> <strong>of the 17 SDGs</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>For women</strong>, access to bank accounts, loans, insurance, and other financial services, results in direct improvements in outcomes of <strong>health, education, employment → economic independence → empowerment</strong>.</li>
<li>In turn, such progress helps achieve the collective goals of <strong>eradicating poverty, promoting inclusive growth, and reducing inequality.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The scheme promoting FI in India:</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>56%</strong> of all these new accounts are owned by <strong>women</strong>, which implies remarkable FI that has significantly reduced the gender gap, <strong>from 17% in 2011 to 6% in 2017</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Direct Benefits Transfer (DBT):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Since its inception in <strong>2013</strong>, the Indian government has cumulatively transferred <strong>16.8 trillion to beneficiaries through DBT. This has led to the FI of women,</strong> as they constitute a good number of beneficiaries under the schemes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Women still lack participation in the formal financial industry. <strong>For example,</strong><ul>
<li>Most women <strong>only access their PMJDY accounts to withdraw</strong> the benefit transfers from the various government initiatives.</li>
<li>Most of them do not use these accounts for <strong>savings, to build a credit history or avail of any financial products</strong> such as insurance and loans.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Inaccessibility:</strong> Most financial services are beyond the reach of most women, particularly in the rural hinterland.</li>
<li><strong>Concerns around privacy and confidentiality:</strong> Hesitation to discuss personal financial matters with strangers.</li>
<li><strong>The lack of collateral</strong> due to limited access to assets and property impedes their ability to avail of loans.</li>
<li><strong>They have less influence</strong> over the family’s important financial choices → leading to wastages or use of benefits for non-essential purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to address these concerns?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Promote women’s access to and literacy in digital tools.</li>
<li><strong>Promote the use of digital payments among women.</strong></li>
<li>Appoint <strong>more women Business Correspondents (BCs).</strong></li>
<li>Deepen <strong>convergence with self-help groups</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Collect gender-disaggregated data</strong> and develop strategies to form <strong>women-centric approaches.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Promote digital credit for medium and small businesses.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Some best practices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Bank Sakhis programme</strong> by the National Rural Livelihoods Mission <strong>trains SHG members</strong> to work as BCs in rural districts.</li>
<li><strong>The PM Mudra Yojana</strong> targets the financial inclusion of women by providing collateral-free loans up to Rs. 1 million for small and micro enterprises.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead: Digital payment solutions can be easily redesigned</strong> to enable access to information that are key stumbling blocks to the FI of women.</p>

<li>It is a United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification’s (<a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/05/12/unccd-conference-of-parties-cop-15/"><strong>UNCCD</strong></a>) flagship publication, whose 1st edition was launched in <strong>2017</strong> at the UNCCD COP13 (China).</li>
<li>It underscores <strong>land system challenges</strong>, showcases transformative policies and practices, and points to <strong>cost-effective pathways</strong> to scale up sustainable land and water management.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Highlights of the report:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Importance of Land:</strong> It is the <strong>operative link</strong> between biodiversity loss and climate change, which means restoring land is crucial to solving interconnected crises.</p>
<p><strong>What are planetary boundaries?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>environmental thresholds</strong> that establish a <strong>“safe operating space for humanity</strong>” are known as planetary boundaries.</li>
<li><strong>The nine planetary boundaries are:</strong><ul>
<li>Biodiversity loss</li>
<li>Land-use change</li>
<li>Climate change</li>
<li>Nitrogen and phosphorus (geochemical) cycles</li>
<li>Freshwater use</li>
<li>Ocean acidification</li>
<li>Chemical pollution</li>
<li>Atmospheric loading</li>
<li>Ozone depletion</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Threats:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Humans have already <strong>altered more than 70%</strong> of the earth’s land area from its natural state.</li>
<li>Of the 9 planetary boundaries, climate change, biodiversity loss, land-use change, and geochemical cycles <strong>have already been exceeded</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Causes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Worldwide, <strong>food systems</strong> (including agriculture) are responsible for <strong>80% of deforestation and 70% of freshwater use</strong> and are the single greatest cause of terrestrial biodiversity loss.</li>
<li><strong>Land degradation,</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/environment-degradation-and-issues/desertification/#:~:text=Desertification%20is%20the%20process%20by,and%20dry%20sub%2Dhumid%20areas."><strong>desertification</strong></a> <strong>and drought</strong> pose a great risk to global food security as well.<ul>
<li>Land degradation is the <strong>reduction or loss of biological and economic productivity of land</strong> and its constituents: soil, water, and biodiversity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong> This has contributed significantly to <strong>global warming and environmental degradation</strong> → leading to a rise in <strong>poverty, hunger, inequality, zoonotic disease transmission,</strong> etc.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Effective land restoration:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The report defines land restoration</strong> as a continuum of activities that<ul>
<li><strong>Avoid</strong> (By eliminating practices that degrade the environment, ranging from land and ecosystem conversion to socio-economic inequalities)</li>
<li><strong>Reduce</strong> (By adopting sustainable land and water management practices) and</li>
<li><strong>Reverse</strong> (By revitalising soil, watersheds, and other elements of natural ecosystems) <strong>land degradation</strong> with the explicit objective of <strong>meeting human needs and improving ecology.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The global annual cost of land restoration</strong> is expected at ~$300 billion by 2030.</li>
<li>Each dollar invested is estimated to <strong>return between $7 and $30</strong> in economic benefits, moving towards an <strong>equitable and sustainable future.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Achieving land degradation neutrality (LDN):</strong> LDN is a state whereby the quantity and quality of land resources required to maintain ecosystem functions and services and improve food security are steady or growing.</p>
<p><strong>Integrated land use planning:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identifying the best combination of land uses</strong> → sustainably meeting the <strong>needs of the stakeholders as well as preserving the land resources.</strong></li>
<li>A cost-effective approach is to <strong>identify landscapes</strong> while maximising benefits, such as in <strong>global restoration hotspots.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Regenerative agricultural practices:</strong> Like terrace farming and rainwater harvesting → help restore land, increase crop yields, reduce GHG emissions, sequester atmospheric carbon, and create meaningful livelihoods.</p>
<p><strong>Inclusive and responsible governance:</strong> It is crucial to facilitate the shift to sustainable land use and management practices.</p>

<p><strong>Some best practices in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Holiyas:</strong> These are water management systems in Gujarat, which store rainwater below the land surface. The groundwater can be accessed and distributed using solar pumps when there is scarcity.</li>
<li><strong>Plantopathy:</strong> It is a unique nature-based solution that can limit the impact of plant diseases on yields without pesticides or chemicals.</li>
<li><strong>Zero budget natural farming (ZBNF):</strong> It combines traditional and emerging practices to reduce costs (i.e., zero budget) while boosting yields and overall farm health by using organic inputs sourced locally (i.e., natural farming).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Land restoration is a <strong>shared responsibility.</strong> Hence, governments, scientists, civil society, and private sector players need to work together to set land and ecosystem restoration goals that transform land-use systems.</p>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/economy/news/accountants-managing-client-money-under-pmla-ambit-finmin-notifies-rules-123050401104_1.html"><strong>BS</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> To further tighten its control of practising accountants, the Centre has brought within the ambit of the <strong>PMLA</strong> their “financial transactions”.</p>
<p><strong>What are the new rules?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Chartered accountants, company secretaries, etc., will now be required to <strong>go through the Know Your Company (KYC) process before commencing work.</strong></li>
<li>This implies accountants are now <strong>reporting entities</strong> if they are managing their clients’ money.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance:</strong> The move aims at curbing fraudulent practices by which accountants allegedly help their clients to launder money.</p>
<p><strong>Need:</strong> The efforts are being taken ahead of the assessment of India under the <strong>Financial Action Task Force (FATF)</strong> – a global regulator that assesses country compliance in tackling global money laundering and terror financing.</p>
<p><strong>What does the PMLA say about reporting entities?</strong></p>
<p>They are required to maintain a record of all transactions and furnish them to <strong>financial intelligence units</strong> (FIUs).</p>
