<h4 id="gs-paper-2"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Structure, Organization and Functioning of the Judiciary</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/explained-why-do-judges-recuse-themselves-and-how-a-look-at-recent-judicial-recusals/article66858096.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Calling it an attempt to indulge in ‘bench hunting’, a former SC judge refused (last week) to recuse himself from hearing a plea.</p>
<p><strong>What is recusal?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is the act of declining to take part in an official activity, such as a court case because the administrative or court authority presiding over it has a <strong>conflict of interest.</strong></li>
<li>This <strong>conflict of interest can arise</strong> in many ways – from holding shares in a litigant company to having a prior or personal association with a party.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The practice of judicial recusals stems from:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The cardinal principles of due process of law:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Nemo judex in sua causa</strong> – no person shall be a judge in his own case.</li>
<li>Justice must not only be done but must also be seen to be done.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The oath of office:</strong> Both the SC and HC judges promise to perform their duties without fear or favour, affection or ill-will, in accordance with the <strong>III Schedule</strong> of the Constitution.</li>
<li><strong>Restatement of the Values of Judicial Life adopted by the SC:</strong> It forbids a judge from deciding a case where he holds pecuniary interest unless the concerned parties clarify that they have no objections.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recent instances of judicial recusals:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In the afore-mentioned case</strong> involving a former IPS officer (Sanjiv Bhat), recusal was sought on the ground that there was a likelihood of bias since the same Judge, a Gujarat HC judge had reprimanded the IPS officer.</li>
<li><strong>The CJI rejected an application</strong> seeking his recusal from hearing petitions seeking legal recognition of same-sex marriages.</li>
<li><strong>Justice Gita Gopi of the Gujarat HC</strong> recused herself from hearing Rahul Gandhi’s appeal seeking a stay on his conviction in the criminal defamation case.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why do judges recuse?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To prevent the perception that the judge was <strong>biased</strong> while deciding a case.</li>
<li>When an appeal is filed in the SC against an HC judgment delivered by the concerned judge before his elevation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the procedure for recusal?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Although several SC judgments have dealt with the issue, <strong>India has no codified rules</strong> governing recusals.</li>
<li><strong>There are two kinds of recusals</strong> – automatic (where a judge himself withdraws from the case) or when a party raises a plea for recusal.</li>
<li>The decision to recuse rests solely on the <strong>conscience and discretion of the judge</strong> and no party can compel a judge to withdraw from a case.</li>
<li>If a judge recuses himself, <strong>the case is listed before the Chief Justice for allotment to an alternate Bench.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Do judges have to record reasons for recusal?</strong></p>
<p>Since there are no statutory rules governing the process, <strong>it is often left to the judges</strong> themselves to record reasons for recusals.</p>
<p><strong>Concerns:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The majority of the time, the grounds for recusal are not made public, which endangers <strong>judicial transparency.</strong></li>
<li>However, the Delhi HC recently ruled that any investigation into the reasons for recusal would constitute <strong>an interference with the course of justice.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What rules have the SC formulated in the past?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ranjit Thakur v. Union of India (1987):</strong> To determine if a judge should recuse, what is relevant is the reasonableness of the apprehension of bias in the mind of the concerned party.</li>
<li><strong>State of West Bengal v. Shivananda Pathak (1998)</strong>: Judicial bias is a condition of mind which renders the judge incapable of impartiality in a particular case.</li>
<li><strong>SC Advocates-on-Record Association v. Union of India (2015)</strong>: Where a judge has a pecuniary interest, no further inquiry is needed to establish whether there is a ‘real danger’ of bias.</li>
<li><strong>Indore Development Authority v. Manoharlal and Ors (2019)</strong>: Merely having a legal opinion does not disentitle one from being impartial.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Practice in foreign jurisdictions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The United State</strong>s has a well-defined law on recusals, which details the grounds for recusal – financial or corporate interest, a case in which the judge was a material witness or a lawyer, and a relationship to a party.</li>
<li><strong>The United Kingdom’s law</strong> laid down a standard to look at the likelihood of bias from the perspective of a fair-minded and reasonable observer.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It is the judge’s ‘constitutional duty’ to be ‘transparent and accountable’</strong> and therefore reasons must be indicated for recusal (Justice Kurien Joseph).</li>
<li>There is a need for ‘<strong>procedural and substantive rules</strong> to deal with the growing frequency of recusal pleas (Justice Madan Lokur).</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Addressing the opening session of the <strong>FIPIC-3 summit</strong> (in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea/PNG), the PM of India highlighted the importance of the 14 members of the FIPIC.</p>
<p><strong>The Pacific Island Countries (PICs):</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/PIC-1.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/PIC-1.png" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>It consists of the 3 major groups of islands: <strong>Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia,</strong> and commonly refers to the <strong>14</strong> countries scattered in the South-West Pacific Ocean.</li>
<li><strong>These are the</strong> Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Niue, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.</li>
<li>The region comprises <strong>strategically located</strong> (at the crossroads of significant maritime trade routes) <strong>small island nations</strong>, with small populations and <strong>resource-rich Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs)</strong>.</li>
<li>Their profile is rising particularly given the popularity of the <strong>Indo-Pacific construct.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>India’s engagement with the PICs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In the early 19th century</strong>, Indian workers were taken to the region to work as indentured plantation labourers and most of whom settled particularly in Fiji and PNG.</li>
<li><strong>After independence</strong>, the region did not find much significance in India’s foreign policy.</li>
<li>However, the changing geopolitical scenario and strategic and economic compulsions, rising naval capabilities have driven India <strong>to refresh and redesign its Pacific policy.</strong></li>
<li>India’s renewed interest can also be seen in the light of its own <strong>rechristened Act East policy</strong>.</li>
<li>At this moment, the total annual trade between India and PICs is about <strong>$300 million –</strong> exports are around $200 million and imports are around $100 million.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Forum for India-Pacific Islands Cooperation (FIPIC):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It was launched during the PM of India’s visit to Fiji in <strong>2014</strong> and <strong>includes 14 of the PICs.</strong></li>
<li>The FIPIC initiative marks a serious effort to expand (from the Indian Ocean) India’s <strong>strategic and commercial interests</strong> in the <strong>Pacific region</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>India’s major assistance projects in the PICs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Setting up <strong>a special USD 1 million fund</strong> for adapting to climate change and clean energy, <strong>establishing a trade office in India</strong>, Pan Pacific Islands <strong>e-network</strong> to improve digital connectivity.</li>
<li>India has <strong>increased the annual “Grant-in-Aid”</strong> from USD 125,000 to 200,000 to each of the 14 PICs for community projects of their choice, and <strong>launched a new Visitors Programme for PICs</strong>.</li>
<li>At the FIPIC-2 (Jaipur, 2015), FICCI launched the <strong>Business Accelerator</strong> for FIPIC to provide necessary information and facilitation to businessmen on both sides.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The advantage to India:</strong> Presence of a sizable Indian Diaspora – nearly 40% of Fiji’s population is of Indian origin and about 3000 Indians live in PNG.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong> India’s interaction with the PICs <strong>still largely revolves around its engagement with Fiji and PNG.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Climate change</strong> is a crucial area of common concern where closer partnerships can be developed for effective and concrete solutions.</li>
<li>For India, it is important to develop <strong>a comprehensive and clearly defined strategy to engage with all the PICs.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The PM of India (at the FIPIC-3) called PICs “<strong>large ocean states</strong>”, highlighting their strategic-commercial importance for India.</li>
<li>The recent efforts have brought India much closer to PICs and to further strengthen its ties, <strong>India should assist the development goals of the PICs.</strong></li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The article analyses the <strong>advantages and challenges of adopting an Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC)</strong> in India.</p>
<p><strong>What is ONDC?</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) is a government initiative</strong> aimed at transforming the <strong>e-commerce market</strong> in India by shifting from a <strong>platform-centric model</strong> to an <strong>open-network model.</strong></p>
<p>Similar to the success of the <strong>Unified Payments Interface (UPI) project</strong>, which enables seamless money transfers across different payment platforms, the ONDC seeks to facilitate <strong>transactions between buyers and sellers regardless</strong> of the platforms they are registered on.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation using an example:</strong></p>
<p>Let’s imagine <strong>you want to buy a product online</strong>, like a <strong>smartphone</strong>. You are registered on Amazon, but you find a <strong>better deal on Flipkart</strong> for the same smartphone you want to buy. In the current system, you <strong>wouldn’t be able</strong> to purchase it from Flipkart because you’re not registered there.</p>
<p>But ONDC is like a <strong>big network that connects all the different e-commerce platforms</strong> together. So instead of being limited to one specific platform, you can buy products from different platforms, even if you are registered on only one of them.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ONDC_1.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ONDC_1.png" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Objectives of ONDC:</strong> Democratization and decentralization of e-Commerce; Inclusivity and access for sellers; Increased choices and independence for consumers and making goods and services cheaper.</p>

<p><strong>The way forward and Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>The success of the <strong>Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC)</strong> will depend on how efficient the listing of products from <strong>various sellers is and maintaining the quality of services.</strong> The government needs to focus on building a <strong>better digital space, implementing a digital education policy, conducting a well-funded adoption campaign</strong>, and providing a secured <strong>single window for issue resolution</strong>.</p>

<p>Bushfire is a wildfire that <strong>occurs in bushland or forested areas</strong>. It is characterized by <strong>uncontrollable flames</strong> that rapidly spread and can <strong>cause significant damage</strong> to vegetation, wildlife, and property.</p>
<p><strong>Australia faces frequent bushfires</strong> due to its <strong>hot and dry climate, flammable vegetation</strong> like eucalypt forests, weather patterns including droughts and strong winds, and human activities like land clearing and arson.</p>
<p>To deal with it, a highly effective bushfire management program has been developed over the past 20 years. From April to June each year, <strong>fire managers use small controlled fires</strong> to reduce <strong>fuel loads</strong> and make the landscape safer. This practice, known as “<strong>painting with fire</strong>,” combines satellite data with <strong>Indigenous knowledge</strong> and expertise from pastoralists and park rangers.</p>
<p><strong>Significance</strong>: The program has led to <strong>significant declines in fire across</strong> the region and has gained international attention as a <strong>model for fire management</strong>. It highlights the importance of integrating <strong>technology, local knowledge, and diverse skills</strong> to achieve sustainable and resilient environmental management.</p>
<p><strong>Usage</strong>: Such techniques can be used for Indian forest fire management as well. Such solutions can be used in Disaster Management/ Environment/ Geography Questions.</p>

<p>Disposable diapers are <strong>single-use, absorbent diapers made of materials like plastic, absorbent polymers, and soft fibres</strong>. They are commonly used for infants and young children as a convenient alternative to cloth diapers.</p>
<p>Scientists have found a unique solution to make <strong>building materials cost-effective and environmentally friendly</strong> by incorporating disposable diapers into them.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits</strong>: By using disposable diapers in construction, it can help reduce the environmental impact of <strong>traditional building materials like concrete.</strong> Recycling diapers in this way can make a positive difference by <strong>shrinking their carbon footprint</strong> and <strong>creating durable materials.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Usage</strong>: Such an example can be used in the Environment question to highlight the use of alternative materials in construction and minimization of wealth.</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: The Ministry of Education organised a workshop with the aim of <strong>unifying the 60 school examination boards</strong> operating in <strong>different States and union territories under one umbrella.</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>The main component of this plan is <strong>PARAKH or the National Assessment Centre</strong> which has been set up as an organisation under the <strong>National Council of Educational Research and Training.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Need for unifying various school boards:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To establish a <strong>common platform and framework</strong> that ensures fairness, equity, and seamless transitions for students across different boards and regions.</li>
<li>To <strong>align curriculum standards, grading systems</strong>, and evaluation methodologies to enhance credibility, recognition of certificates, and grades obtained across boards.</li>
<li>Unification also aims to <strong>address the prevailing rote examination culture</strong> and promote <strong>holistic assessments</strong> that encompass various dimensions of a student’s abilities and potential.</li>
<li>It emphasizes the <strong>importance of well-designed question papers, balanced assessments</strong>, and reducing the burden of high-stakes examinations while effectively measuring student progress.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About PARAKH:</strong></p>
<p>It has been launched <strong>as part of the implementation of the National Education Policy (NEP)-2020</strong> which envisaged a standard-setting body to advise school boards regarding <strong>new assessment patterns and the latest research and promote collaborations between them</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It will be tasked with holding periodic learning outcomes tests like the National Achievement Survey (NAS) and State Achievement Surveys.</strong></li>
<li>It will work on three major assessment areas: <strong>large-scale assessments, school-based assessments, and examination reforms.</strong></li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The government has decided to <strong>reduce the subsidy provided under the FAME-II</strong> scheme for <strong>electric two-wheelers</strong> starting in June.</p>
<p><strong>Ministry of Heavy Industries notified changes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The subsidy for electric two-wheelers would be reduced to <strong>₹10,000 per kilowatt hour (kWh)</strong> effective 1 June 2023 from <strong>₹15,000 currently</strong>.</li>
<li>The cap on incentives for <strong>such vehicles has been lowered to 15%</strong> of the ex-factory price of vehicles from the earlier <strong>40%</strong>.</li>
<li>But the <strong>total amount allocated toward providing incentives</strong> for these vehicles will be raised from the <strong>current ₹2,000 crores</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The rationale for changes:</strong></p>
<p>The intention behind lowering the subsidy and increasing the funds for electric two-wheelers is to <strong>support more consumers through the FAME scheme</strong> with the available funds.</p>

<td><strong>What is Pangenome Map?</strong></td>
<td>A pangenome map is a <strong>way of looking at the collective genetic information of a group</strong> of related organisms or species. It goes beyond just one individual’s genetic makeup and considers the genetic diversity within that group.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>What is genome and genome sequencing?</strong></td>
<td>The human genome refers to the e<strong>ntire set of DNA in the nucleus of every cell in the human bod</strong>y. It is like an <strong>identity card (e.g., Aadhar) unique to each individual</strong>. Genome sequencing is a method used to <strong>determine the precise order and arrangement of the four letters</strong> (A, T, G, and C) in the genome. It helps us understand <strong>human diversity at the genetic level</strong> and our susceptibility to <strong>certain diseases.</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>What is a reference genome?</strong></td>
<td>A reference genome is a <strong>complete set of genetic information</strong> for a specific individual. When newly sequenced genomes are compared, they are matched against a <strong>reference map</strong> called a reference genome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>How pangenome map is different from the Reference genome?</strong></td>
<td>While a reference genome represents <strong>a single individual</strong>, a pangenome map captures the <strong>genetic diversity and variation across</strong> multiple individuals or populations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Principle</strong></td>
<td>The concept of a pangenome acknowledges that a <strong>species’ genome is not a fixed entity and is different for different individuals.</strong> This genetic variation contributes to differences in traits, disease susceptibility, and other biological characteristics.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Why is a pangenome map important?</strong></td>
<td>A pangenome map provides a comprehensive understanding of a <strong>species’ genetic content.</strong>  This helps explain <strong>genetic differences, and human diversity, study gene evolution,</strong> identify disease-associated genes, and understand the overall genomic architecture of a species.<br><br>This can shed light on <strong>disease prevalence, aid in discovering new genes for rare diseases</strong>, design <strong>better diagnostic methods</strong>, and facilitate the discovery of novel drugs for those diseases.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Pangenome map and India</strong></td>
<td>The current pangenome map <strong>does not include genome sequences from Indians.</strong> However, it can still help map Indian genomes against existing <strong>error-free and complete reference genomes</strong>.</td>
