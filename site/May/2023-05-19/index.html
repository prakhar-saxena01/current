<p><strong>Context:</strong> The chir pine belt of <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/05/17/forest-fires/">Uttarakhand, India, faces <strong>significant forest fire</strong></a> <strong>challenges</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>What is Chir Pine Belt?</strong></p>
<p>It refers to an area characterized by the <strong>dominance of chir pine trees</strong> (Pinus roxburghii). It is found primarily in the state of Uttarakhand. The high presence of <strong>chir pine trees</strong> in this belt also contributes to the <strong>susceptibility to forest fires in the area</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>About the chir pine:</strong></p>
<p>It is a species of pine tree that is <strong>native to the Himalayan region</strong>. It is a <strong>fast-growing evergreen tree and forms dense forests</strong> in the sub-tropical and temperate regions of Uttarakhand.</p>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Factors</strong></td>
<td><strong>Description</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>High forest density</strong></td>
<td>Uttarakhand accounts for <strong>1.6 per cent of India’s total geographical area</strong>. But in terms of forest cover, the state accounts for <strong>45 per cent</strong>, in contrast to national forest cover of just <strong>21.67 per cent.</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>High presence of pine trees</strong></td>
<td>Chir pine dominates the forest composition in the region. Pine trees are rich in <strong>organic polymers</strong>, making them <strong>vulnerable to forest fires</strong>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Dry biomass</strong></td>
<td>Pine needles and other plant-based litter create fuel for fires. Dry biomass increases the risk of fire outbreaks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Vulnerability of narrow-leaved species</strong></td>
<td>The forest ecosystem in the region is dominated by <strong>narrow-leaved species</strong> <strong>like Pinus, Picea, and Abies</strong>. These species are <strong>susceptible to fires</strong> when exposed to low temperatures and humidity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Human-made fires</strong></td>
<td><strong>Timber smugglers</strong> often set intentional fires to divert attention and facilitate illegal activities. <strong>Developmental activities</strong> and <strong>unchecked land-use patterns</strong> contribute to human-induced fire hazards.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Climate conditions</strong></td>
<td>Uttarakhand experiences <strong>low rainfall and high temperatures</strong>. The ample availability of <strong>dry biomass</strong> during the <strong>summer season</strong> increases fire risks. Also, <strong>Strong winds</strong> contribute to the rapid spread of fires across the forests.</td>

<p><strong>National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA)</strong> has suggested measures for <strong>fire control in Himalayan regions</strong> such as Early detection and reporting; Fireline creation; Community involvement; Training and capacity building; Use of technology and Firefighting teams.</p>
<p><strong>A few measures taken are:</strong></p>
<p>National Policy on Forest Fire (finalized by the government); National Plan for forest fire management; National Forest Fire Danger Rating System; Firefighting tools and machinery (e.g. Fire Beaters, Pulaskis Tools, Forest Fire Showel, etc.); Forest Fire Prevention &amp; Management Scheme (FFPMS, 2017)</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Addressing and mitigating forest fires</strong> in the Himalayan region requires a comprehensive approach that includes early detection, community involvement, capacity building, technology utilization, and effective collaboration between various stakeholders. By implementing these measures, the <strong>risk and impact of forest fires can</strong> be significantly reduced, protecting the invaluable biodiversity and ecological balance of the region.</p>

<td><strong>Topic</strong></td>
<td><strong>Debt Ceiling</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Definition</strong></td>
<td>The <strong>maximum amount of money</strong> that the US government is legally allowed to borrow to fund its operations and meet its financial obligations. It sets a cap or limit on the total amount of government debt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Origin</strong></td>
<td>Established by the <strong>US Congress in 1917 during World War I</strong> to promote fiscal responsibility in the federal government.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Issue</strong></td>
<td>Disagreement between <strong>President Joe Biden (executive) and the Republican-controlled US Congress (Legislature)</strong> on raising the debt ceiling. The decision to increase the borrowing <strong>cap lies with the US Congress</strong>, which needs to vote on it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Impact</strong></td>
<td>Possible <strong>government default if the debt ceiling</strong> is not raised, leading to economic consequences such as a weaker dollar, stock market problems, and job losses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The downgrade of the <strong>US credit rating</strong> made future borrowing more expensive for the government.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hinders <strong>discussions on long-term fiscal challenges</strong> and has become a <strong>political tool</strong> instead of a responsible fiscal mechanism.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Impact on India</strong></td>
<td>Increased <strong>volatility in financial markets affects</strong> currency exchange rates, capital flows, and investor confidence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Impact on <strong>India’s exports, foreign direct investment</strong>, and overall economic stability.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Previous instance</strong></td>
<td>In 2011, the US faced a near default on public debt due to a delay in raising the debt ceiling. This led to the first downgrade in the US credit rating, a sharp drop in the stock market, and higher borrowing costs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Suggestions for reforms</strong></td>
<td>Automatic increase of the debt limit whenever legislation is passed or abolishing the debt limit altogether</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>India’s Debt Ceiling Mechanism</strong></td>
<td>India <strong>does not have a formal debt ceiling mechanism</strong> like the one in the United States.<br><br>The Indian government <strong>manages borrowing and debt obligations</strong> through fiscal discipline, budgetary controls, and oversight by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The <strong>Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act</strong> governs India’s borrowing activities, setting targets for fiscal deficits and debt-to-GDP ratios.</td>

<h4 id="facts-for-prelims-ffp_1"><strong>Facts for Prelims (FFP)</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://m.timesofindia.com/business/india-business/govt-introduces-minimum-import-price-for-apples-in-jk-to-support-local-growers/articleshow/100285758.cms#:~:text=This%20policy%20mandates%20that%20any,the%20apple%20growers%20of%20J%26K."><strong>TOI</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Central Government of India has introduced the <strong>Minimum Import Price (MIP)</strong> for apples in Jammu and Kashmir (J&amp;K) <strong>to protect the domestic industry</strong> from unfair competition and <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/03/07/what-is-predatory-pricing/#:~:text=Predatory%20pricing%20is%20the%20illegal,more%20vulnerable%20to%20a%20monopoly.">predatory pricing</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What is MIP?</strong></p>
<p>MIP is a <strong>temporary measure implemented by a government</strong> to protect domestic industries from unfair competition and <strong>predatory pricing of imported goods</strong>. The MIP sets a <strong>minimum price below which the import</strong> of a particular commodity is not allowed.</p>
<p><strong>Who frames the rules:</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT)</strong> is the arm of the commerce ministry responsible for framing rules related to exports and imports, including the implementation of MIPs.</p>
<p><strong>Significance</strong>: By setting a minimum import price, the government aims to prevent apple imports from flooding the market at excessively low prices, and provide a <strong>level playing field</strong> to farmers in J&amp;K.</p>
<p><strong>About Apple cultivation:</strong></p>
<p>Apple cultivation in India primarily <strong>takes place in regions such as Jammu &amp; Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, the hills of Uttar Pradesh and Uttaranchal</strong>. It is also grown to a lesser extent in Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Punjab, and Sikkim. China produces the <strong>world’s largest number of apples</strong>. India is ranked <strong>5th</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Climatic condition for Apples:</strong></p>
<p>The ideal climatic conditions for apple cultivation include an <strong>average summer temperature of 21-24 degrees</strong> <strong>Celsiu</strong>s during the active growth period. Apple trees can be grown at altitudes ranging from <strong>1500 to 2700 meters above sea level</strong>. Well-distributed rainfall of <strong>1000-1250 mm throughout</strong> the growing season is <strong>most favourable</strong> for the optimal growth and fruitfulness of apple trees. Additionally, apples thrive best in <strong>well-drained, loamy soils.</strong></p>

<h4 id="facts-for-prelims-ffp_3"><strong>Facts for Prelims (FFP)</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/global-temperatures-set-reach-new-records-next-five-years"><strong>WMO</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> According to the <strong>World Meteorological Organization (WMO)</strong>, global temperatures are now more likely than not to <strong>exceed the 1.5°C (2.7°F) warming threshold</strong> within the next five years.</p>
<p><strong>About the Finding:</strong> WMO’s <strong>Global Annual to Decadal Climate Update</strong> highlights a <strong>66%</strong> chance of temporarily exceeding <strong>1.5°C by</strong> 2027 (than the average global temperature from 1850-1900), a significant increase from last year’s estimate of approximately 50-50 odds.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Threshold of 5°C:</strong> This threshold is <strong>critical to avoid the disastrous</strong> consequences of global warming, as warned by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.</li>
<li><strong>Hottest year:</strong> The WMO’s predictions also indicate a <strong>98% chance that one of the next five</strong> years will be the hottest on record, surpassing the previous record set in 2016.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reason for increased likelihood</strong>: <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/15/el-nino-and-monsoon/">El Niño</a>, combined with human-induced <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/climate-change-and-associated-issues/">climate change</a> will contribute to higher global temperatures.</p>
<p><strong>Significance</strong>: This represents the <strong>first time in history that surpassing 1.5°C is</strong> considered more probable than not, thus indicating an alarming trend.</p>
<p><strong>Impact on India</strong>: The increased temperature will likely lead to lower monsoon rainfall. Hotter oceans also contribute to <strong>stronger cyclones</strong> (e.g., <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/08/cyclones-how-are-cyclones-formed-and-named/">Cyclone Mocha</a>). India, with its reliance on <strong>rain-fed agriculture and a long coastline</strong>, will face significant challenges due to global climate changes.</p>
<p><strong>Measures needed:</strong> Improving <strong>forecasting capabilities for cyclones</strong> and <strong>weather anomalies</strong> is crucial, but building <strong>resilience</strong> through investments in <strong>disaster-related infrastructure</strong> is equally important. India <strong>must prioritize infrastructure development</strong> to defend against the increasing threat of <strong>climate-related disasters</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>About WMO:</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>World Meteorological Organization</strong> (founded: 1950; HQ: Geneva; Parent organization: UN Economic and Social Council) is a <strong>specialized agency</strong> of the UN responsible for promoting international cooperation on atmospheric science, climatology, hydrology and geophysics.</p>
