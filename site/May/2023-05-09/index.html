<p><strong>Context:</strong> The World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 was no longer a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC).</p>
<p><strong>When was it declared PHEIC?</strong></p>
<p>COVID-19 was announced as a ‘PHEIC’ by the WHO on <strong>January 30, 2020.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the current status of COVID-19?</strong></p>
<p>It has acquired the status of other endemic diseases (from the pandemic). India reached the COVID-19 endemic stage a year ago.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/covid-19.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/covid-19.png" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Trends during COVID-19 spread in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>‘COVID deniers’ at the beginning of the pandemic:</strong> Resulted in the spiking of the COVID-19 cases in India.</li>
<li><strong>Misinformation during the 2nd wave:</strong> A third wave in India would affect children resulting in the deprivation of schooling and learning of children.</li>
<li><strong>Policy interventions missed factoring in the local context:</strong> Local context determines the epidemiological pattern, spread of disease and proposed interventions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lessons from COVID Pandemic that India must embrace and implement:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Invest in healthcare (HC) infrastructure.</strong></li>
<li><strong>India needs National HC Services Regulatory Authority:</strong> To check rampant black marketing of critical drugs, artificial shortage and discrepancies in the cost of the same.</li>
<li>India needs more doctors, paramedics and hospitals.</li>
<li><strong>Revamp Primary health centres with the PPP model.</strong></li>
<li>Bring the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) under PMO to enhance proficiency in predicting future pandemics.</li>
<li><strong>Better pay and training of ASHA workers:</strong> They played a critical role in creating awareness in rural India – allaying fake apprehensions regarding vaccines.</li>
<li><strong>Fight disinformation in mission mode.</strong></li>
<li><strong>A strategic reserve of critical medicines.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steps taken by India towards Covid-19 prevention:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Surveillance Consortium (<strong>INSACOG</strong>) for genomic sequencing and tracking the evolution of variant strains of SARS-CoV-2.</li>
<li><strong>The National Biopharma Mission (NBM) and the Ind-CEPI Mission</strong> have enabled the strengthening of the national vaccine development ecosystem.</li>
<li><strong>Mission COVID Suraksha</strong> was launched as part of the <strong>Aatmanirbhar Bharat 3.0</strong> for promoting the R&amp;D of Indian COVID-19 vaccines.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Some best practices in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>“Har Ghar Dastak” campaign:</strong> Aims at awareness, mobilisation and vaccination of all eligible beneficiaries.</li>
<li><strong>Training of healthcare professionals:</strong> The Government of India has utilised the <strong>iGOT</strong> (Integrated Government Online Training) platform to train various personnel.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>COVID-19 has ‘officially’ transitioned from a population-level challenge to more of an <strong>individual health concern</strong>.</li>
<li>The government should offer <strong>formal training courses</strong> <strong>in epidemiology</strong> to prepare India for future outbreaks and epidemics and to curb misinformation.</li>
<li><strong>Integrate the COVID-19 response to general health services</strong>. There is no role for universal measures against COVID-19 to be enforced.</li>
<li>It is time to drop the COVID-19 fixation and move on to <strong>tackle other more pressing health challenges</strong> in the country.</li>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Historical</strong></td>
<td>The Maldives has a history intertwined with India, including conquest by <strong>Rajaraja Chola’s Chola dynasty</strong> (Maldives’ northern atolls). It became a British colony and gained independence in 1965, leading to political unrest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Security Partnership</strong></td>
<td>Joint Exercises – “<strong>Ekuverin”, “Dosti”, “Ekatha” and “Operation Shield</strong>” (begun in 2021). India provides the largest number of training opportunities for the <strong>Maldivian National Defence Force (MNDF),</strong> meeting around 70% of their defence training requirements.<br><br>Maldives occupy an important position in India’s vision of ‘<strong>SAGAR’</strong> (Security and Growth for All in the Region) and <strong>‘Neighbourhood First’.</strong></td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Economic Cooperation</strong></td>
<td>India is Maldives’ <strong>2nd largest trading partner.</strong> <strong>Afcons</strong>, an Indian company, signed a contract for the <strong>Greater Male Connectivity Project</strong> (GMCP)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Infrastructure Projects</strong></td>
<td><strong>Hanimaadhoo International Airport Development project</strong> under an Indian credit line. National College for Policing and Law Enforcement (NCPLE) was inaugurated by India’s External Affairs Minister (2022)</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Rehabilitation Centre</strong></td>
<td>A drug <strong>detoxification and rehabilitation centre</strong> in Addu was built with Indian assistance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>China Factor</strong></td>
<td>China’s strategic footprint in India’s neighbourhood has increased. The Maldives has emerged as an <strong>important ‘pearl’ in China’s “String of Pearls” construct in South Asia.</strong> Given the uncertain dynamics of Sino-Indian relations, China’s strategic presence in the Maldives remains a concern.</td>

<p><strong>Challenges in India-Maldives relations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Political Instability:</strong> For instance, the arrest of Maldives’ opposition leader Mohamed Nasheed in 2015 and the subsequent political crisis strained India’s relationship with Maldives.</li>
<li><strong>Radicalisation</strong>: The increasing number of Maldivians being drawn towards terrorist groups like the Islamic State (IS) and Pakistan-based jihadist groups is a concern for India.</li>
<li><strong>China’s Strategic Presence</strong>: China’s increasing strategic presence in Maldives is a challenge for India. The Maldives has emerged as an important ‘pearl’ in China’s “String of Pearls” construct in South Asia, which is a concern for India’s security.</li>
<li><strong>China’s dominance:</strong> In 2018, Maldives cancelled an agreement with India to develop a key naval base on <strong>the island of Marao</strong>.The move was seen as a result of China’s growing influence in the Maldives.</li>
<li><strong>Political actions:</strong> Maldives cancelled a <strong>$511 million contract</strong> awarded to Indian company <strong>GMR</strong> to develop Male International Airport in 2012, which strained the relationship between the two countries.</li>
<li><strong>Domestic Politics</strong>: The India Out campaign in Maldives, which seeks to create anti-India sentiments among the people of Maldives</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>India needs to play a crucial role in ensuring regional security in South Asia and surrounding maritime boundaries by <strong>actively participating in the Indo-Pacific security space</strong>. Effective communication and <strong>convincing Maldivians about India’s intentions behind its projects</strong> on the island nation are essential to avoid any changes in the domestic political situation in Maldives.</p>

<p><strong>What is soft power diplomacy?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Soft power</strong> is the ability to obtain preferred outcomes by attraction rather than coercion or payment. <strong>Soft power diplomacy</strong> refers to the use of <strong>cultural, social, and economic</strong> means to influence the attitudes and behaviours of other countries, rather than relying solely on military or economic coercion. The concept of soft power was coined <strong>by Joseph Nye in</strong> the 1990s.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples of soft power diplomacy</strong> include cultural exchanges, educational programs, humanitarian aid, and public diplomacy campaigns.</li>

<p><strong>India faces several challenges in promoting soft power through Buddhism, including</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many of <strong>India’s ancient Buddhist heritage sites</strong> are in a state of disrepair, which makes it challenging to attract visitors and promote Buddhist tourism.</li>
<li><strong>Competition with other countries</strong>: Despite being home to a <strong>number of key Buddhist sites, such as Bodhgaya, Sarnath, and Kushinagar</strong>, India has struggled to attract Buddhist tourists, who tend to favour sites in Thailand and Cambodia.</li>
<li><strong>Fragmented Buddhist community</strong>: The Indian Buddhist community is fragmented and divided along sectarian lines, which makes it challenging to create a unified approach to promoting Buddhism.</li>
<li><strong>India’s soft power is often overshadowed by its economic and political power</strong>, which means that its cultural influence, including that of Buddhism, is not always recognized on the international stage.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>There is a need of <strong>promoting connections with other Buddhist schools of thought</strong>, such as <strong>Nagarjuna Buddhism</strong>, which is largely unexplored in academic study. Also, emphasize the need for effective implementation of the Nalanda University project and proper management of tourist sites for the success of the Buddhist Circuit Project.</p>
<p><strong>Quote:</strong> <strong>“India has not given ‘Yuddha’ to the world but ‘Buddha’</strong>.” –PM Modi</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion 2:</strong> As Buddha was the first diplomat of peace, his teachings of peace and cooperation in these tough times can become the guiding light of Indian diplomacy on the world stage.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> According to a new study by the <strong>ESCAP</strong>, most countries in Asia-Pacific (AP) are inadequately prepared to manage the rising challenges of extreme weather events and natural disasters.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights of the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) study:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/carbon_1.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/carbon_1.png" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The AP region accounts for <strong>more than half of the world’s GHGs.</strong></li>
<li>Over the past 60 years, <strong>temperatures in the AP region have increased faster than the global mean</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Extreme, unpredictable weather events and natural hazards</strong> (like Tropical cyclones, heatwaves, floods and droughts) have become more frequent and intense.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Damaging people’s health,</strong> immense loss of life and displacement.</li>
<li>Food systems here are being disrupted, <strong>economies damaged and societies undermined</strong>.</li>
<li>Leading cause of <strong>poverty and inequality</strong> across the region by <strong>disproportionately burdening poor and marginalised groups.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Most vulnerable:</strong> China, <strong>India</strong>, Japan, Indonesia, the Republic of Korea and the Russian Federation are projected to suffer the greatest losses under the worst-case climate scenario.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The AP region is one of the <strong>most rapidly developing regions</strong> of the world, with a <strong>significant proportion</strong> of the global population.</li>
<li>The region is also home to <strong>most of the world’s low-lying cities</strong> and vulnerable small island states.</li>
<li><strong>Overlapping crises</strong> of climate change and climate-induced disasters are increasingly threatening development in AP –<ul>
<li>Undermining hard-won development gains.</li>
<li>Imperils <strong>Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Lack of necessary data as well as means</strong> to support adaptation and mitigation efforts.</li>
<li><strong>The current financing is insufficient</strong> to meet the region’s requirements for investment in climate action or to contain global warming at 1.5°C.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steps needed:</strong></p>
<p><strong>The emissions gap in three key sectors</strong> – energy, transport and international trade and investment – needs to be closed.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Energy:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A rapid increase in renewable energy</strong> by restructuring national energy systems, new technical capacities, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>The need for cross-border electricity grids</strong> to increase the share of renewable energy.</li>
<li><strong>Energy efficiency codes</strong> must be aligned with net-zero goals to reduce carbon footprint in the building sector.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Climate-proofing energy systems</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The transport sector</strong>: Should be shifted to a <strong>low-carbon pathway</strong> by reducing transport distance through integrated land use, planning, shifting to sustainable transport modes, as well as improving vehicle and fuel efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>International trade:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integrate climate considerations into regional trade agreements.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Trade must be climate-smart</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>The private sector</strong> must be encouraged to work towards a low-carbon pathway and sustainability should be ingrained into business operations.</li>

<h4 id="gs-paper-2_3"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Effect of Policies and Politics of Developed and Developing Countries on India’s Interests</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/explained-why-is-the-eus-carbon-border-tax-worrying-other-countries-including-india/article66804351.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The European Parliament – the legislative body of the 27-member EU, reached a political deal on the carbon border tax – <strong>Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>CBAM was first introduced as a part of the <strong>European Green Deal</strong>, which serves as a guide for both tax and non-tax policy initiatives in the EU to achieve its ambitious target of <strong>becoming climate neutral by 2050.</strong></li>
<li>This was followed by a proposal for a regulation on CBAM in 2021 as part of the “<strong>Fit for 55</strong>” policy package, aiming to reduce GHG by at least 55% by 2030, from the levels of 1990.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the CBAM?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/the_EU.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/the_EU.png" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>It plans to impose <strong>a tariff/import duty on a set of carbon-intensive imports</strong>, which will have to be paid by EU importers and companies who export such goods to EU countries.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Need for CBAM:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To prevent “carbon leakage”:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Carbon leakage</strong> is when companies relocate the production or manufacturing of carbon-intensive materials to countries with less stringent climate rules.</li>
<li>This is <strong>to avoid restrictions on carbon emissions</strong> in their home country.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>To nudge behavioural change:</strong><ul>
<li>According to WB, <strong>less than 4% of global emissions</strong> are currently under carbon pricing regimes as envisioned by the Paris Agreement.</li>
<li><strong>Most levies aren’t high enough</strong> to effect an actual change in polluter behaviour.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Significance:</strong> By setting the <strong>price for the carbon content</strong> of goods regardless of where they are produced, it will <strong>create a level field for businesses</strong> inside the bloc and those outside.</p>
<p><strong>Why are developing countries/India opposing CBAM?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>BRICS</strong> have opposed the measure, describing it as a <strong>unilateral, protectionist trade weapon</strong> that could lead to market distortion.<ul>
<li><strong>For example, I</strong>ndia has contended that the CBAM will translate into a 20-35% tariff on India’s exports, which now attract an MFN duty of less than 3%.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Economic shock for countries</strong> reliant on one/more of the targeted industries.<ul>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> Mozambique’s GDP <strong>would drop by about 1.5%</strong> due to the tariffs on aluminium exports alone.</li>
<li><strong>27% of India’s exports</strong> ($8.2 billion) of steel, iron and aluminium products head to the EU.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong> Funds from the sale of the CBAM levy can be diverted to support climate action efforts in less developed countries. This will guarantee both climate justice and the achievement of carbon emission targets.</p>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/japan-south-korea-cooperation-needed-for-global-peace-president-yoon-says-in-meeting-pm-kishida/article66822991.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p>Shuttle diplomacy refers to <strong>a type of diplomacy where a mediator travels</strong> back and forth between two or more parties in order to facilitate negotiations and resolve disputes. It is often used when <strong>direct talks between the parties are not possible</strong> due to political, geographical, or security reasons.</p>
<p>E.g., Efforts made by then-<strong>U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger</strong> in the 1970s to negotiate peace between Israel and Egypt. Kissinger flew back and forth between Jerusalem and Cairo, meeting with leaders from both sides, in order to broker a ceasefire and ultimately the <strong>Camp David Accords</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Present context:</strong> More recently, the term “shuttle diplomacy” has been used to describe the efforts made by Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol to mend ties between their two countries.</p>
<p><strong>Usage</strong>: Such terms can be directly asked in prelims or can be used in Mains in International Relations/Essay paper.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The NCP has demanded an <strong>“unconditional apology”</strong> from a religious leader (Jaggi Vasudev) for making the claim that Saint Samarth Ramdas was Maratha ruler Chhatrapati Shivaji’s guru.</p>
<p><strong>Who was Samarth Ramdas/Sant Ramdas?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Samarth Ramdas (1608 – 1681)</strong> was a Hindu <strong>saint, philosopher, poet, writer and spiritua</strong>l master.</li>
<li>A devotee of <strong>Lord Ram and Hanuman</strong>, he has influenced Hindu nationalist thinkers across the years like <strong>Lokmanya Tilak, KB Hedgewar and VD Savarkar.</strong></li>
<li>His <strong>Maruti Stotra</strong> is still commonly recited by school children as well as wrestlers akharas across Maharashtra.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Shivaji Bhonsale I (1630-1680), popularly known as Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, was a <strong>Maratha ruler from the Bhonsle clan</strong>.</li>
<li>From the declining Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur, <strong>Shivaji carved out his own independent kingdom</strong>, laying the foundation of the Maratha Empire.</li>
<li>At Raigad Fort in <strong>1674</strong>, he was formally crowned Chhatrapati (Emperor) of his empire.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What do historians say?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Shivaji Maharaj and Samarath Ramdas were</li>
<li><strong>Shivaji Maharaj gave donations to temples</strong> of Samarth Ramdas as well as other people and religions.</li>
<li>There is <strong>no historical evidence</strong> to verify the fact that Samarth Ramdas was the guru of Chhatrapati Shivaji.</li>
<li>This may be done for the <strong>maintenance of Brahmanical supremacy</strong>.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has banned five entities, including an employee of the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), from the securities market for ‘front-running’</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>Front-running is an <strong>illegal practice in the stock market</strong> where an individual or entity trades based on <strong>advanced information</strong> obtained from a broker or analyst before it is made available to their clients.</p>
<p><strong>For example,</strong> suppose a broker receives a large <strong>order to buy shares of Company X</strong> from a client. Before placing the order on behalf of the client, the broker may purchase shares of Company X for their personal account, knowing that the client’s order will drive up the price of the shares. Once the price of the shares rises, the <strong>broker can sell their shares</strong> at a profit.</p>

<td><strong>What is a flyway?</strong></td>
<td>A flyway is a <strong>geographical region within which a single or a group of migratory species</strong> completes its annual cycle i.e. breeding, moulting, staging and non-breeding. Migratory birds from <strong>3 flyways</strong> (CAF, East Asian Australasian Flyway and Asian East African Flyway) visit India.</td>

<td><strong>Central Asian Flyway (CAF)</strong></td>
<td>Covers a large area of Eurasia between the Arctic and Indian Oceans. One of the <strong>nine most important flyways for migratory birds around the world</strong>.<br><br><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/world-flyway.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/world-flyway.png" /></a></td>

<td><strong>Limits</strong></td>
<td>It extends from the <strong>northernmost breeding grounds in the Russian Federation (Siberia)</strong> to the southernmost non-breeding (wintering) grounds in <strong>West and South Asia, the Maldives and British Indian Ocean Territory</strong>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Importance</strong></td>
<td>Approximately <strong>one in five of the world’s 11,000 bird species migrate</strong>, some covering enormous distances. Conserving migratory birds requires cooperation and coordination along the entire flyway between countries and across national boundaries.</td>
