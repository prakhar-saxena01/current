<p><strong>Context:</strong> The article highlights the increasing cases of violence within families, suicides among young individuals, and the rising number of children involved in criminal activities as <strong>symptoms of societal ill-health and disruptions in the traditional family system</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>What is a family?</strong> </p>
<p>A family is a <strong>social unit consisting of individuals</strong> who are related by blood, marriage, or adoption. It is a <strong>fundamental institution in society</strong> where members provide support, love, and care for one another, and <strong>share common experiences, values, and responsibilities</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>What is the meaning of a traditional Indian family?</strong></p>
<p>The traditional Indian family refers to the <strong>prevailing family structure and dynamics</strong> that have been <strong>historically and culturally</strong> prevalent in Indian society. It <strong>typically</strong> follows a <strong>patriarchal system</strong> where the <strong>father or eldest male member</strong> holds authority and decision-making power within the family.</p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-3_1"><strong>GS Paper 3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus: Science and Technology: Health</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source: WHO</strong></p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: The new WHO report (<strong>Incentivising the Development of new antibacterial treatments 2023</strong>) highlights progress in addressing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) but also identifies gaps in ensuring a robust pipeline of antibiotic treatments.</p>
<p><strong>What is AMR?</strong></p>
<p>It refers to the <strong>ability of microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites</strong>, to resist the effects of antimicrobial drugs, such as antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals, and antiparasitic drugs. E.g., New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM-1) superbug</p>
<p><strong>Status of AMR:</strong></p>
<p>It was responsible for nearly <strong>5 million global deaths</strong> in 2019 and is projected to cause over <strong>2mn death by 2050</strong> in India alone. Yet the <strong>development of new antibiotics is limited</strong>, and access to existing treatments remains a challenge.</p>
<p><strong>What does the Report say:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>AMR remains <strong>one of the top 10 global public health</strong> threats facing humanity</li>
<li><strong>1 in 5 deaths</strong> caused by AMR occurred in children under the age of 5.</li>
<li>If no action is taken, <strong>AMR could cost the world’s economy</strong> USD 100 trillion by 2050.</li>
<li><strong>Recommendations by the report</strong>: increased investments in <strong>research and development</strong>, alignment of <strong>financing mechanisms</strong>, and global efforts to ensure <strong>equitable access to antibiotics</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are the problems with AMR in India?</strong></p>
<p>AMR is a particular challenge in India due to the high burden of communicable diseases, an overburdened public health system, limited laboratory capacity, inexpensive and widely available antibiotics without prescriptions, Excessive use of antibiotics in livestock and poultry farming etc</p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/anti_mi.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/anti_mi.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Other initiatives:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>India</strong>: <strong>National Action Plan on AMR</strong> (NAP-AMR) for 2017-2021 (updating it for 2022-2026)</li>
<li><strong>Global</strong>: <strong>One Health Quadripartite</strong>: In 2021, the FAO, UNEP, WHO and World Organisation for Animal Health joined to combat AMR.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>There is a need for <strong>priority actions to accelerate progress,</strong> including commitments at the <strong>high-level meeting on AMR</strong> at the <strong>United Nations General Assembly in 2024</strong> and targeted financing mechanisms to address the crisis and ensure equitable access to antibiotics.</p>

<p>The <strong>World Health Organization (WHO)</strong> has warned about the potential harm of using artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare without proper monitoring and regulation.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the concerns raised by WHO are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The use of biased data to train AI</strong> can result in misleading information, posing risks to health, equity, and inclusiveness.</li>
<li>Generate responses that seem reliable but may be <strong>completely incorrect</strong>, especially in health-related contexts.</li>
<li>AI can be <strong>trained on data without prior consent</strong>, potentially compromising sensitive user-provided information.</li>
<li><strong>AI can be manipulated</strong> to spread convincing disinformation that is hard to distinguish from reliable health content.</li>

<p><strong>Context: Khasi Hills Autonomous District Council (KHADC)</strong> ordered not to issue an ST certificate to any Khasi person who adopts their father’s surname as it is <strong>against the traditional custom of inheriting the mother’s surname.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the matrilineal system among Khasis?</strong></p>
<p>It refers to a <strong>social and kinship system</strong> where descent and inheritance are traced through the <strong>female line</strong>. In this system, family lineage, property, and clan membership are passed down from mother to daughter. Among Khasis, the <strong>youngest daughter (khatduh)</strong> of the family is entrusted the full share of the ancestral – <strong>or the clan’s – property</strong></p>
<p>The three tribes of Meghalaya — <strong>Khasis, Jaintias, and Garos</strong> — practise a matrilineal system of inheritance.</p>
<p><strong>About Khasis Tribe:</strong></p>
<p>The Khasis are an <strong>indigenous community in Meghalaya</strong>. While the majority of Khasis are <strong>Christians</strong> now, their traditional beliefs revolved around a <strong>Supreme Being called U Blei Nongthaw</strong>. The Khasi community celebrates festivals such as the <strong>Nongkrem Dance and Shad Suk Mynsiem.</strong></p>
<p><strong>About KHADC:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>KHADC is a <strong>body under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution.</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>Sixth Schedule</strong> of the Constitution provides for the administration <strong>of tribal areas in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram</strong>to safeguard the <strong>rights of the tribal population in these states.</strong></li>
<li>It provides for <strong>autonomy in the administration</strong> of these areas through <strong>Autonomous District Councils (ADCs),</strong>which are empowered to make laws in respect of areas under their jurisdiction.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Lenders have sought a <strong>one-year extension from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI</strong>) for implementation of the <strong>Expected Credit Loss (ECL)-based loan loss provisioning framework</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>What is loan loss provisioning?</strong></p>
<p>Loan loss provisioning refers to the practice of <strong>setting aside funds by banks to</strong> cover <strong>potential losses arising</strong> from loans that may default or become unrecoverable.</p>
<table>

</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Current System</strong></td>
<td>Banks are required to <strong>make loan loss provisions</strong> based on an “<strong>incurred loss” approach</strong>. Also, the Loan loss provisioning happens much later, leading to an <strong>increase in credit risk for banks</strong>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>“Incurred Loss” model</strong></td>
<td>This model assumes that <strong>all loans will be repaid until evidence</strong> to the contrary is identified. Only at that point is the defaulted loan written down to a lower value. This leads to a delay in the recognition of defaults.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>The New Proposal</strong></td>
<td>RBI has proposed an <strong>expected loss (EL)-based approach</strong> for provisioning by banks in case of loan defaults. Banks are required to <strong>estimate expected credit losses</strong> based on forward-looking estimations. Banks have to <strong>categorize ECL norms</strong> for assessing the quality of assets and the expected loss.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>ECL Norms</strong></td>
<td>Banks classify financial assets (<strong>primarily loans, including irrevocable loan commitments, and investments classified as held-to-maturity or available-for-sale</strong>) into three categories: <strong>Stage 1, Stage 2, and Stage 3.</strong><br><br><strong>Stage 1:</strong> Financial assets that have not had a significant increase in credit risk or with low credit risk at the reporting date.<br><br><strong>Stage 2:</strong> Financial instruments that have had a significant increase in credit risk but don’t have objective evidence of impairment.<br><br><strong>Stage 3</strong>: Financial assets that have objective evidence of impairment at the reporting date</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Origin</strong></td>
<td>In 2012, the DoT ordered telecom operators to share their <strong>subscriber database, including user pictures.</strong> These images form the basis for the facial recognition algorithm used in ASTR. The ASTR project was <strong>developed by the DoT’s unit</strong> in Haryana between <strong>April 2021 and July 2021.</strong></td>

<td>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Facial Recognition</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Functionality</strong></td>
<td><strong>Analyzing subscriber databases</strong> to identify multiple connections associated with the <strong>same person</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Example of its working</strong></td>
<td>Suppose there is a <strong>suspected face associated with multiple mobile connections</strong>. ASTR will <strong>compare this face against a database of images to identify other connections</strong> linked to the same face. If there are more than nine connections against a single individual’s photograph or if the same person has taken SIMs under different names, ASTR will flag it as potentially fraudulent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Connection Limit</strong></td>
<td>Currently, a <strong>maximum of nine mobile connections</strong> can be taken using a single identity proof</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Action Taken</strong></td>
<td>The list of fraudulent connections will be shared with telecom operators, banks, payment wallets, and social media platforms</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Description of technology used:</strong></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Image Processing</strong></td>
<td><strong>Faces in subscriber images</strong> are encoded using convolutional neural network (CNN) models</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Face Comparison</strong></td>
<td>A face <strong>comparison is carried</strong> out for each face against all faces in the database to group similar faces under one directory</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Matching Accuracy</strong></td>
<td>Faces are considered identical if they match to the extent of <strong>at least 97.5%</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Name Matching</strong></td>
<td><strong>“Fuzzy logic”</strong> is used to find similarity or approximate matches for subscriber names, accounting for typographical errors</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>What is fuzzy logic?</strong></td>
<td>Fuzzy logic is a <strong>mathematical approach that deals with uncertainty and imprecise information</strong>. It allows for the <strong>representation of vagueness and partial truth,</strong> unlike traditional binary logic.</td>

<p><strong>Significance of the move:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It will <strong>enhance the treatments</strong> that can be offered under one roof.</li>
<li>It will help <strong>build harmonized protocols</strong> for clinical care research, and this is especially important for <strong>non-communicable diseases</strong>, where medical treatment options are limited.</li>
<li>It will take Ayurveda and yoga to the world.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong> Randomised control trials (RCTs) and peer-reviewed studies of traditional medicine must be promoted.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Many systems of medicine have a role to play in keeping human beings well. Modern medicine is extremely important, but there is a wealth of wisdom and ancient traditions which can be incorporated sensibly and safely for the well-being of man.</p>

<p><strong>Highlights of the study:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>59% of the surveyed households experienced climate shocks</strong> in at least one of the five previous years → <strong>using their own savings to cope with the issue.</strong></li>
<li>As rural households have <strong>limited access to liquidity</strong>, they <strong>take high-interest loans</strong> from informal sources.</li>
<li><strong>Households rely on financial assistance</strong> from kin and relatives followed by friends, village communities, money lenders, and banks (in this order).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Factors affecting access to financial services:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location:</strong> Most commercial banks set up their branches in profitable urban commercial areas.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of infrastructure in rural and semi-urban areas:</strong> Lack of access to a formal banking outlet, proper internet, electricity, etc., are major roadblocks to both consumers and financial institutions.</li>
<li><strong>Rising unemployment and low wages:</strong> Financial conditions of people plays a pivotal role in accessing available financial services.</li>
<li><strong>Service charges:</strong> High bank charges not only discourage people but also create a lack of trust among people using banking and financial services.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai) has relaxed norms for <strong>‘surety bonds’.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The changes introduced:</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>solvency requirement</strong> for surety bonds has been reduced to <strong>1.5 times</strong> from the previous <strong>1.875 times</strong>, and the exposure limit of <strong>30% applicable</strong> to each contract underwritten by an insurer has been removed.</p>
<p><strong>Aim of the changes</strong>: The changes are aimed at <strong>expanding the surety insurance market</strong> and increasing the availability of such products.</p>
<p><strong>What is Surety Bond?</strong></p>
<p>A surety bond is a <strong>type of insurance policy</strong> that ensures parties involved in a contract are protected from financial losses if one party fails to fulfil its obligations.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>If a construction company <strong>fails to complete a project as agreed</strong>, the surety bond compensates the client for the losses. It ensures <strong>financial protection and guarantees</strong> that the contract will be fulfilled.</p>
