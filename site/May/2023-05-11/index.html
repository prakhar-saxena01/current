<h4 id="gs-paper-1"><strong>GS Paper 1</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus</strong><strong>:</strong> <strong>Social issues</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/global-polycrisis-creating-uphill-battle-end-child-marriage-unicef"><strong>UNICEF</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> According to UNICEF, multiple crises are threatening to reverse hard-earned gains in the decline in child marriage.</p>
<p><strong>Child marriage:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It refers to any formal marriage or informal union <strong>between a child under the age of (18 for females and 21 for males in India)</strong> and an adult or another child.</li>
<li>Most child marriages involve girls, many of whom are in poor socio-economic conditions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Data on child marriage:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Worldwide, an estimated 640 million girls and women alive today were married in childhood, or <strong>12 million girls per year.</strong></li>
<li>Child marriages have <strong>declined from 21 to 19% (globally)</strong> since the last estimates were released five years ago.</li>
<li>However, global reductions would have to be 20 times faster to meet SDG (<strong>5.3</strong>) of ending child marriage by 2030.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Status in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While <strong>India</strong> has recorded significant progress in recent decades, <strong>it still accounts for one-third of the global total</strong> (India’s child marriage rate is 21% as per NHFS-5).</li>
<li><strong>Eight States</strong> have a higher prevalence of child marriage than the national average – West Bengal, Bihar and Tripura top the list with <strong>more than 40% of women</strong> aged 20-24 years married below 18.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Most affected regions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>South Asia</strong> continues to remain home to nearly half (45%) of the world’s child brides.</li>
<li><strong>Sub-Saharan Africa</strong> is home to the second-largest global share of child brides (20%).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Highlights of the UNICEF’s findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The world is engulfed by a <strong>‘Polycrisis’</strong> – a cluster of related global risks with compounding effects, such that the overall impact exceeds the sum of each part.</li>
<li><strong>Health and economic crises</strong> (rising poverty, income shocks), escalating armed conflicts, <strong>climate change shocks</strong> and the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 are forcing families into <strong>child marriage</strong>.</li>
<li>Girls living in fragile settings are <strong>twice as likely to become child brides</strong> as the average girl globally.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/child_marrage.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/child_marrage.jpg?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Fig: Factors Driving Child Marriage</strong></p>
<p><strong>Immediate and lifelong consequences on girls:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Less likely to remain in school.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Difficult for girls to access</strong> health care, social services and community support that protect them from child marriage.</li>
<li><strong>Increased risk of early pregnancy</strong> → increasing the risk of child and maternal health complications and mortality.</li>
<li>Can also <strong>isolate girls</strong> from family and friends, taking a <strong>heavy toll on their mental health and well-being.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Laws and policy interventions in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act 2006 and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act 2012</strong> aim at protecting children from violation of human and other rights.</li>
<li>A parliamentary standing committee is weighing the pros and cons of <strong>raising the age of marriage for women to 21</strong>, which has been cleared by the Union Cabinet.</li>
<li><strong>Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana:</strong> The government launched this scheme in 2015 to encourage parents to save money for the future of their girl child</li>
<li><strong>Kanyashree Prakalpa Scheme:</strong> The West Bengal government launched this scheme in 2013 to promote the <strong>education and welfare of girls and prevent child marriage</strong> in the state.</li>
<li><strong>National Plan of Action for Children:</strong> The plan includes strategies to prevent child marriage and promote education and healthcare for children</li>
<li>Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao (BBBP) Scheme</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead for India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The solution lies in <strong>empowering girls, creating proper public infrastructure and addressing societal norms</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>At the gram panchayat level,</strong> ensuring that Child Protection Committees and Child Marriage Prohibition officers are doing the job and activating community support groups.<ul>
<li><strong>Best practice:</strong> Odisha now has over 12,000 Child Marriage Free Villages.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>It is possible to end child marriage, which requires unwavering support for vulnerable girls and families. The focus should be on keeping girls in school and making sure they have economic opportunities.</p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-1_1"><strong>GS Paper 1</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Role of women</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-65530408"><strong>BBC</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> India surpassed China as the world’s most populous country, which led analysts to highlight the potential benefits of India’s demographic dividend.</p>
<p><strong>A major obstacle to realising this potential:</strong> Insufficient representation of women in India’s workforce.</p>
<p><strong>Significance of more women in the workforce:</strong> India could add $550bn to its GDP by increasing its female labour force participation by just 10% (McKinsey).</p>
<p><strong>What does the data say?</strong> Nearly half of India’s population is female and yet, the female participation rate in India’s labour force has consistently fallen from its peak in <strong>2000 (31%</strong>) to a low of <strong>21% in 2018</strong> (World Bank).</p>
<p><strong>Reasons for this:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>India is still a largely patriarchal society</strong>:<ul>
<li>Indian women spend 8 times the number of hours on <strong>unpaid care work compared with men.</strong> The global average is 3 times.</li>
<li><strong>Only 32% of Indian women work after they get married</strong> and most of them are part of the agricultural sector.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Safety concerns</strong>: Not being able to find jobs close to home also prevent women in big cities from joining the workforce.</li>
<li><strong>Insufficient formal wage employment opportunities:</strong> For example, women employees account for less than 20% of India’s manufacturing sector.</li>
<li><strong>Concentration in low/non-productive jobs:</strong> Like agriculture, primary caregiver at home, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of opportunities for women returning</strong> to their careers after a professional break.</li>
<li>Higher level of participation in education and <strong>increase in the family income.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/meso.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/meso.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Steps taken:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A new <strong>Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship</strong> has been established to coordinate the skill development schemes across various sectors.</li>
<li>The <strong>National Career Service (NCS) Project</strong> provides a nationwide online platform for job seekers and employers.</li>
<li><strong>The Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act 2017</strong> provides for enhancement in paid maternity leave from 12 weeks to 26 weeks and provisions for mandatory crèche facilities.</li>
<li>An advisory to the States under the <strong>Factories Act 1948</strong> for permitting women workers in the night shifts with adequate safety measures.</li>
<li>A network of <strong>Women Industrial Training institutes,</strong> National Vocational Training Institutes and Regional Vocational Training Institutes.</li>
<li>A number of protective provisions have been incorporated in various labour laws – <strong>The Equal Remuneration Act 1976, The Minimum Wages Act 1948.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best practices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TVS (one of India’s biggest two-wheeler manufacturers):</strong> Offers a scheme for women who are returning to their careers (after the break) with flexible working hours, mentoring and training to them.</li>
<li><strong>Gabriel India Ltd [An auto parts company in Hosur (Tamil Nadu)]:</strong> It provides perks such as on-site accommodation, subsidised food and training programmes to attract more women workers, as their attrition rates are lower compared to their male counterparts.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A policy framework</strong> encouraging and enabling women’s participation should be constructed.</li>
<li>Active awareness of the “<strong>gender-specific</strong>” constraints that face most women.</li>
<li><strong>Gender-responsive policies</strong> need to be contextually developed.</li>
<li>The goal is not merely to increase female labour force participation, but to provide <strong>opportunities for decent work</strong> → contribute to the economic empowerment of women.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Women’s labour force participation and access to decent work are important and necessary elements of an <strong>inclusive and sustainable development (SDG 5) process.</strong></p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-2"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus: Social Justice: Health</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/09-05-2023-global-progress-in-tackling-maternal-and-newborn-deaths-stalls-since-2015--un"><strong>WHO</strong></a> </p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: According to a report by the <strong>United Nations</strong> global progress on improving maternal and newborn health has halted since 2015.</p>
<p><strong>Objective of the report:</strong> It outlines progress at the mid-point for the achievement of the <strong>Sustainable Development Goals</strong>, and highlights priority actions towards eliminating preventable maternal and newborn deaths and stillbirths.</p>
<p><strong>Global Findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Global progress in reducing deaths of pregnant women, mothers and babies has <strong>stagnated for eight years</strong></li>
<li><strong>Deaths</strong>: Over <strong>4.</strong><strong>5 million</strong> women and babies die every year during pregnancy, childbirth or the first weeks after birth – mostly from <strong>preventable or treatable causes if proper care</strong> was available.<ul>
<li><strong>290 000 maternal deaths</strong> each year</li>
<li><strong>1.9 million stillbirths</strong> (babies who die after 28 weeks of pregnancy )</li>
<li><strong>2.3 million newborn deaths</strong> (in the first month of life)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>India Findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>India tops the list of 10 countries</strong> which bear <strong>60% of global maternal deaths</strong>, stillbirths &amp; newborn deaths burden</li>
<li><strong>India accounts for 17 per cent</strong> of global maternal deaths, stillbirths and neonatal births</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Despite the high numbers, As per the Sample Registration System (SRS) report</strong> by the Registrar General of India (RGI), the Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) of <strong>India has reduced from 130 per 100,000 live births in 2014-16 to 113 per 100,000</strong> live births in 2016-18.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons for the halt in progress:</strong></p>

<td><strong>Examples</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Decreasing investments in maternal and newborn health</strong></td>
<td>Just <strong>1 in 10 countries</strong> (of more than 100 surveyed) report having sufficient funds to implement their health schemes related to maternal and newborns.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Lack of Infrastructure</strong></td>
<td><strong>Less than a third of countries</strong> report having sufficient newborn care and maternal care units.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Prematurity (the leading cause of under-five deaths globally)</strong></td>
<td>According to the report, every year<strong>, 2.5 million babies</strong> are born <strong>prematurely</strong>, and one million of these babies die due to complications.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>COVID-19 pandemic</strong></td>
<td>Around a <strong>quarter of countries</strong> still report ongoing disruptions to vital pregnancy and postnatal care and services for sick children.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Rising poverty</strong></td>
<td>Poverty can impact access to quality maternal and child healthcare services, nutrition, and education.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Worsening humanitarian crises</strong></td>
<td>For example, the <strong>current crisis in Sudan and the Russia-Ukraine</strong> war can affect access to healthcare services and supplies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Gender inequality</strong></td>
<td><strong>Only about 60% of women aged 15-49 years</strong> make their own decisions regarding sexual and reproductive health and rights. This can affect access to healthcare services and information.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Scale-up access to quality <strong>sexual and reproductive health services</strong> as part of universal health coverage and primary health care</li>
<li><strong>Use of technology</strong>: E.g., using a simple, low-cost collection device called a ‘drape’ to reduce blood loss during delivery</li>
<li><strong>Addressing harmful gender norms</strong>, biases and inequalities</li>
<li><strong>Investment and political</strong> commitment</li>
<li><strong>Strengthening service delivery</strong> for quality and respectful care</li>
<li>Community engagement</li>
<li>Data and information systems</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The meeting in Riyadh between Saudi Arabia and the US, UAE, and India underlines the growing strategic convergence between Delhi and Washington in the Gulf.</p>
<p><strong>What is unique about this meeting?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A major departure</strong> <strong>from the traditional approaches</strong> to the Middle East in both India and the US.</li>
<li><strong>In India</strong>, the Nehruvian foreign policy either opposed Washington or kept its distance from the US in the Middle East.</li>

<p><strong>Recent changes in USA’s foreign policy (recalibrating its regional strategy):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pakistan</strong> was a key part of the <strong>Baghdad Pact (1955),</strong> Central Treaty Organisation (CENTO) and the Regional Cooperation for Development (1964) to counter the Communist threat to the region.</li>
<li>However, it <strong>does not figure in the current strategy</strong> to connect the Gulf with the Subcontinent.</li>
<li>This means the US is <strong>discarding its pro-Pakistan bias</strong> in thinking about the relationship between the Subcontinent and the Gulf and building <strong>new partnerships</strong>, including with Delhi.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What led to the changes in the foreign policies of India and the US?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The decline in the Role of Pakistan in the Middle East:</strong><ul>
<li>Pakistan’s continuing strategic decline, and <strong>socio-economic-political challenges.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pakistan has drifted too close to China</strong> (all-weather partnership), tempted to align with China and Russia in the region.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The rising power of the Arabian Peninsula:</strong><ul>
<li>The Gulf kingdoms (especially Saudi Arabia and the UAE) have <strong>accumulated massive financial capital and economic transformation</strong> will reduce their dependence on oil.</li>
<li>They have also begun to <strong>diversify</strong> their strategic partnerships, develop nationalism, promote religious tolerance and initiate social reform.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>India’s new possibilities in the Arabian Peninsula:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Regional partnership</strong> with the US is seen in terms of geopolitical competition with China, elevating its own standing in the region.</li>
<li><strong>Economic growth</strong> and productive involvement in promoting <strong>connectivity and security.</strong></li>
<li>Overcoming violent religious extremism within the Subcontinent.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong> Beijing is now the second most important power in the world, and its diplomatic and political influence in the Gulf region will continue to rise.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Seizing the new strategic opportunities in the Gulf would involve the long overdue modernisation of Delhi’s strategic discourse on the Gulf.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> India fears that a proposal by the US under the “supply chains” pillar of the IPEF could violate WTO rules and reduce policy space.</p>
<p><strong>US proposal:</strong> All IPEF partner nations would be required to <strong>give advance notification of any changes to export regulations and tariffs.</strong></p>
<p><strong>India’s concern:</strong> Notifications are usually done only after measures are taken and not before. India has therefore sought industry inputs to protect its interests.</p>
<p><strong>The IPEF:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is an <strong>economic initiative</strong> launched by the US President Joe Biden on May 23, <strong>2022</strong>.</li>
<li>The framework launched with a total of <strong>14 participating founding member nations</strong> in the Indo-Pacific region with an open invitation for other countries to join.</li>
<li>The IPEF members represent <strong>40% of the global GDP and 28% of the world’s trade.</strong></li>
<li>Analysts have compared it to the <strong>Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)</strong>, which the US withdrew from in <strong>2017</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The IPEF has four pillars:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trade, supply chains, clean economy, and fair economy.</strong></li>
<li><strong>India</strong> has yet to take a call on whether to join the <strong>trade pillar</strong>, though it has joined the other three.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is working on increasing the share of the <strong>Build-Operate-Transfer (toll) model in highway construction to 10% of the total awards</strong></p>
<p><strong>Status of the model used:</strong></p>
<p>As per the ICRA report: EPC will remain the mainstay of awarding contracts, accounting for <strong>70-75% of total projects</strong> offered while BOT will be less than 5%.</p>
<p><strong>Aim of NHAI:</strong> Building <strong>60% of highways through HAM</strong>, <strong>30% through EPC</strong>, and <strong>10% through BOT (toll).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Changes proposed in BOT:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>NHAI will offer <strong>only viable projects with land already tied up for bidding</strong>, which can be completed on their own or with viability gap funding.</li>
<li>NHAI will <strong>commit 90% of the construction zone</strong> (land for execution) for such projects</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility has been given to concession holders</strong>, allowing them to change ownership after a year instead of two years as was the rule earlier.</li>
<li>Innovations like <strong>dispute resolution boards and sharing of traffic risk</strong> have been provided to make BOT (toll) more attractive.</li>
