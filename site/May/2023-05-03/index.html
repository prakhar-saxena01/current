<h4 id="gs-paper-1"><strong>GS Paper 1</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Developmental issues, Urbanization, their problems and their remedies</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/govt-extends-smart-cities-mission-deadline-year-8586018/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry (MoHUA) has e<strong>xtended the deadline for the Smart Cities Mission</strong> from June 2023 to June 2024.</p>
<p><strong>What is the Smart Cities Mission?</strong>
- It is an initiative of the MoHUA launched as a <strong>Centrally Sponsored Scheme</strong> on June 25, <strong>2015</strong>.
- To <strong>promote cities</strong> that provide core infrastructure, and a clean and sustainable environment, <strong>100 cities</strong> (to be developed as Smart Cities) have been selected through a two-stage competition (from January 2016 to June 2018).
- 66 of the cities are small (less than 1 million population) and are implementing two-thirds of the projects.</p>
<p><strong>It aims to:</strong>
- <strong>Drive economic growth</strong> through comprehensive work on social, economic, physical and institutional pillars of the city and
- <strong>Improve the quality of life</strong> through smart solutions.
- <strong>Focus on sustainable and inclusive development</strong> by the creation of replicable models which act as lighthouses to other aspiring cities.</p>
<p><strong>The six fundamental principles on which the concept of Smart Cities is based are:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/community.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/community.png" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What kinds of projects were proposed?</strong>
- The project includes making certain stretches of pedestrian-friendly roads into more capital-intensive ones like <strong>laying water pipelines and constructing STPs.</strong>
- In addition, <strong>some PPP infrastructure projects</strong> like multi-modal transport hubs, common mobility cards and public bike sharing are included.
- All 100 cities have also constructed <strong>Integrated Command and Control Centres</strong> to monitor all security, emergency and civic services.
    - During the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic, <strong>these were converted into emergency response</strong> <strong>units</strong> by many of the cities.</p>
<pre><code>  **What is the status of the projects?**
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The projects were supposed to be completed within five years, but in 2021 the Ministry <strong>changed the deadline for all cities to June 2023</strong>.</li>
<li>As of March 2023, the 100 cities have issued work orders for <strong>7,799 projects worth Rs 1.80 lakh crore</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>50 out of the 100 cities</strong> have completed <strong>75% of the projects</strong> and would be able to complete the remaining works by June.</li>
<li>However, they would need <strong>more time to carry out the documentation, dissemination and institutionalisation</strong> of the best practices and innovations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance of extending the deadline to June 2024:</strong> It will enable all 100 smart cities to not only complete their projects but also document and disseminate the learnings from the mission.</p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-2"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Issues Relating to Poverty and Hunger</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/indias-hunger-paradox-self-sufficiency-in-production-does-not-necessarily-mean-food-security-8586109/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> To achieve the goal of zero hunger, India should have a special and immediate focus on India’s youngest children.</p>
<p><strong>Why India’s youngest children need urgent attention?</strong>
- According to the WHO, a <strong>minimum of 33% of the daily calorie intake</strong> is expected to come from food (at six months of age).
    - The child obtains the remaining calories through <strong>“on-demand” breastfeeding.</strong>
- According to the NFHS-5, <strong>18%</strong> of mothers reported that their child (<strong>between ages 6-23 months</strong>) did not eat any food/“zero-food” in the 24 hours preceding the survey.
- Close to <strong>40%</strong> did not eat any grains (roti, rice, etc) for an entire day, and <strong>six out of 10 children</strong> do not consume milk (“<strong>zero-milk</strong>”).
- This raises <strong>serious concerns related to severe food insecurity</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Impact/extent of nutritional deprivation among young children:</strong>
- The percentage of children short for their age (<strong>stunting</strong>) or
- Weighing less given their height (<strong>wasting</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Steps taken:</strong>
- <strong>Mission Poshan 2.0:</strong> The flagship programme dedicated to maternal and child nutrition.
- <strong>National Food Security Act 2013</strong>
- <strong>Zero Hunger Programme:</strong> Began in 2017 to improve agriculture, health and nutrition.
- Eat Right India Campaign
- Food Fortification
- PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong>
- <strong>Zero-food</strong> underscores that achieving <strong>sufficiency in food production</strong> (the world’s leading country in milk production) does not necessarily mean attaining <strong>food security</strong>.
- <strong>Deficiency in data</strong> (food-based metrics) related to food and dietary consumption to effectively monitor and assess the performance of government initiatives.
- <strong>The rising burden of cardiovascular</strong> and other non-communicable diseases in India.
- <strong>Disruptions in global food production and distribution systems</strong>, accentuated by the ongoing Ukrainian-Russian conflict.</p>
<p><strong>What needs to be done?</strong>
- Given their <strong>multifactorial nature</strong> with regard to what causes stunting or wasting among children, the <strong>specific nature of the deficiencies must be assessed</strong>.
    - For this, <strong>assessments using household-level food insecurity modules</strong> developed by the FAO can be adapted.
    - This will constitute the foundation for any <strong>evidence-based policy</strong>.
- <strong>Multiple</strong> (not single) ministries/departments of the Government of India should take responsibility for designing, implementing and monitoring policies.</p>
<p><strong>The success story of the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM):</strong> SBM offers valuable insights for schemes like Poshan 2.0, in its strategic use of directly <strong>trackable metrics</strong>, and <strong>strong political commitment</strong> at the highest levels.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> To achieve the SDG (2) of zero hunger, India should consider a strategic initiative aimed at eliminating food insecurity by ensuring adequate-affordable-accessible-nutritionally diverse food, with a special and immediate focus on mothers and children.</p>

<pre><code>- #### **GS Paper 3**

  **Syllabus: Science and Technology**

  **Source:** [**IE**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/grappling-with-ai-how-govts-plan-to-deal-with-revolutionary-tools-like-chatgpt-and-bard-8585936/)

  **Context:** The Group of Seven (G7) has proposed a **“risk-based” regulation** for artificial intelligence (AI) tools, which could be a **first step towards creating a template to regulate AI** such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard.

  **What is AI?**

  AI stands for **artificial intelligence**, which is the **ability of machines to learn and perform tasks** that normally require **human intelligence**, such as problem-solving, decision-making, and language understanding.

  **What is GPT?**

  [![](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT.png?is-pending-load=1)](https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GPT.png)

  **Concerns related to rising AI software and chatbots:**

  |   |   |
  |---|---|
  |**Concerns**|**Explanation**|
  |**Privacy**|There is a risk that personal and sensitive information data could be used for unethical purposes, such as **for targeted advertising** or for **political manipulation.**|
  |**Responsibility**|Since AI models can generate new content, such as images, audio, or text it may be used to **generate fake news or other malicious content**, without knowing who is responsible for the output. This could lead to ethical dilemmas over responsibility.|
  |**Automation and Lowering of Job**|AI has the potential to automate many processes, which could lead to **job displacement for people who are skilled in those areas.**|
  |**Bias and Discrimination**|AI can be trained on biased data, which can result in the algorithm making decisions that unfairly disadvantage certain groups. This can perpetuate **societal inequalities and lead to discrimination**.|
  |**Lack of Transparency and Accountability**|There are concerns about **who should be held responsible for the actions of AI systems –** creators of the AI systems, the companies that deploy them, or the governments that regulate them.|

  **Various steps taken by countries to regulate AI are:**

  |   |   |
  |---|---|
  |**Country**|**Initiative**|
  |**G7**|The EU’s **“risk-based” regulation of AI refers** to the proposed AI Act that seeks to regulate artificial intelligence tools **based on their level of risk**. The act categorizes AI systems into four categories:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;·        **Unacceptable risk** (e.g., in case of critical infrastructure)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;·        **high risk**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;·        **limited risk**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;·        **minimal risk** (e.g., spam filters, word processing)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The level of risk determines the **degree of regulatory scrutiny and compliance requirements** that the AI system would be subject to.|
  |**EU**|The proposed AI Act **segregates artificial intelligence by use-case scenarios** based broadly on the degree of **invasiveness and risk**. The AI Act is due next year.|
  |**Italy**|Became the first major Western country to **ban Open AI’s ChatGPT out of concerns over privacy.**|
  |**UK**|Adopts a **‘light-touch’ approach that aims** to foster innovation in the AI industry.|
  |**Japan**|Takes an **accommodative approach** to AI developers.|
  |**China**|**Drafted a 20-point draft to regulate generative AI** services that are likely to be enforced later this year.|
  |**India**|**ICMR releases guidelines** for artificial intelligence use in the health sector; Niti Aayog’s **National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence** and the **Responsible AI for All report**. India is **not considering any law** to regulate AI currently. **India’s AI penetration factor at 3.09**, the highest among all G20, OECD countries|
  |**US**|**Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights** that proposed a **nonbinding roadmap** for the responsible use of AI. The Blueprint spelt out five core principles to govern the effective development of AI systems.|

  **Conclusion:**

  Although the **risks of AI are widely known**, it remains unclear how the **proposed AI Bill of Rights would address these risks** and how grievances would be remedied. Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak, and over 15,000 others have **called for a six-month pause in AI development**, and for shared safety protocols to be implemented by labs and independent experts.

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Researchers at the <strong>Pune-based Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute in India</strong> have decoded copper plates revealing that the celebrated Sanskrit poetess <strong>Shilabhattarika</strong> was a daughter of the “Satyashraya” <strong>Chalukyan ruler Pulakeshin II</strong>.
- Previously, it was thought that she was the wife of the <strong>8th-century Rashtrakuta ruler Dhruva</strong>
- <strong>The title of “Satyashraya” (patron of truth)</strong> was associated with Chalukyan Emperor, Pulakeshin II of Badami</p>
<p><strong>Works of Shilabhattarika</strong>:</p>
<p>It adheres to the <strong>Panchali style</strong> that calls for a balance of words with its meaning. She inspired the Sanskrit <strong>poet-critic Rajashekhara</strong> (who lived in the 9th-10th century CE) and was the court poet of the <strong>Gurjara-Pratiharas</strong> and noted <strong>Marathi poetess, Shanta Shelke</strong> drawn inspiration from <strong>Shilabhattarika’s verse</strong> to compose one of her most iconic songs— toch chandrama nabhat (translated as ‘it is the same moon in the sky’).</p>
<p><strong>What are Copper-plate charters?</strong></p>
<p>They are ancient inscriptions on <strong>copper plates that were used as legal documents</strong> in India during the medieval period. These plates were used to <strong>record land grants, donations, and other royal decrees. This</strong> charter had five plates, held together by a copper ring bearing a beautiful Varaha (boar) seal (trademark of the Badami Chalukyas)</p>
<p><strong>About Chalukya dynasty (6th to 12th Century; founder: Pulakeshin I):</strong></p>
<p>It was a Classical Indian dynasty that ruled large parts of southern and central India  as three related yet individual dynasties— “Badami Chalukyas”, ruled from Vatapi (modern Badami),  Eastern Chalukyas (from Vengi) and Western Chalukyas (from Kalyani)</p>
<p><strong>About Pulakeshin II</strong></p>
<p>He ruled from <strong>610-642 CE.</strong> He defeated Harshavardhan of Kanauj in a battle near the banks of the Narmada River in 618 CE.</p>

<p><strong>Source: IE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Supreme Court of India has ruled that <strong>it can directly grant divorce</strong> to couples under <strong>Article 142 (1)</strong> of the Constitution, which allows it to do <strong>“complete justice”</strong> in any cause or matter.</p>
<p><strong>What did SC say?</strong></p>
<p>The court can waive the <strong>mandatory six-month waiting period for divorce under The Hindu Marriage Act (HMA), 1955,</strong> and allow the dissolution of the marriage on grounds of an <strong>irretrievable breakdown</strong> even if one of the parties is not willing.</p>
<p><strong>Significance of the decision</strong>: The decision enables couples to bypass the time-consuming process of obtaining a decree of divorce through family courts, which have a large number of similar cases pending.</p>
