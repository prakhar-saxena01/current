<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Government Policies and Interventions for Development in various sectors and Issues arising out of their Design and Implementation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/tread-a-new-path-one-that-prioritises-social-justice/article66797405.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> May 1 is widely known as Labour Day/International Worker’s Day – a day to celebrate the contribution of workers worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The origin of Labour Day dates back to the <strong>19th century –</strong> when a nationwide strike of <strong>1886</strong> for an <strong>eight-hour workday</strong> culminated in a violent movement in <strong>Chicago, US.</strong></li>
<li><strong>In 1889,</strong> the International Socialist Conference declared May 1 would be an international holiday for labour/May Day/Labour Day/Workers Day.</li>
<li><strong>In India</strong>, the first Labour Day (initiated by the Labour Kisan Party of Hindustan) was celebrated on <strong>May 1, 1923, in Madras.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The primary objective of Labour Day:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To acknowledge the hard work and dedication of the working class,</li>
<li><strong>Create awareness about their rights</strong>, and</li>
<li>Protect them from exploitation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Current trends in the labour market worldwide:</strong> Three years after the COVID-19,</p>
<ul>
<li>Small and micro-enterprises/people have been hard hit by <strong>inflation</strong></li>
<li>Lack of opportunities</li>
<li><strong>Real wages have fallen</strong>, and poverty inequality is rising</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Indian labour market – Major issues:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Surplus labour force</strong>: Without the commensurate rise in job opportunities in the labour market.</li>
<li><strong>Unskilled labour force:</strong> Leading to a rise in indecent/poor quality jobs like manual scavenging, etc.<ul>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> 8 people died in Gujarat (in April 2023) while cleaning sewers, despite the practice being declared illegal across the country.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Low absorption of skilled labour</li>
<li><strong>Labour market imperfections:</strong> Such as lack of adequate information regarding jobs, <strong>numerous labour laws</strong>, etc.</li>
<li><strong>The workers in the unorganised sector:</strong> Constitute about <strong>93%</strong> of the total workforce in the country → not covered under social security measures → most affected during COVID-19 pandemic.</li>
<li><strong>Unemployment:</strong> Causing problems like disguised unemployment, seasonal unemployment, open unemployment and educated unemployment.</li>
<li><strong>Son of the soil doctrine:</strong> For example, Haryana enacted a new law reserving 75% of private sector jobs with monthly salaries up to ₹30,000 for locals.</li>

<p><strong>How to prioritise social justice for a sustainable and stable future?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Policies and actions must be human-centred</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Focusing on ‘decent work’:</strong> The most effective way to reduce inequality, and poverty and ensure social protection is a ‘Decent Work for All’ – <strong>SDG 8.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Addressing the long-term structural transformations:</strong> By ensuring that <strong>new technology creates and supports employment</strong>, and skills training, treating demographic changes/migration as a ‘dividend’.</li>
<li><strong>Reinvigorate labour institutions and organisations:</strong> To make social dialogue effective and vigorous.</li>
<li><strong>Review laws and regulations</strong>: To make them up-to-date – protecting workers and supporting sustainable businesses.</li>
<li><strong>Creating a global platform:</strong> To recommit to international cooperation and solidarity and to create greater policy coherence, <strong>a Global Coalition for Social Justice</strong> is needed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Social justice should be the keystone of labour reforms at the level of national, regional and global policies and actions. This will help in achieving equitable and resilient societies.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The recent strike by Zomato-owned Blinkit delivery agents has once again brought to the forefront the issues plaguing the gig economy in the country.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> The strikes began when Blinkit slashed the <strong>minimum payout per delivery to Rs 15 per delivery</strong> from Rs 25.</p>

<p><strong>Issues faced by gig workers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Since the gig economy <strong>falls outside the scope of traditional, full-time employment</strong>, gig workers usually <strong>lack basic employment rights</strong> such as<ul>
<li>Minimum wages,</li>
<li>Overtime pay,</li>
<li>Medical leave, and</li>
<li>A statutorily bound resolution of employer-employee disputes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Whether gig workers should be categorised as <strong>‘employees’ or as ‘independent contractors’</strong>?</li>
<li>It depends on the <strong>extent of control and supervision exercised by the employer</strong> and the <strong>integration of the worker with the organisation</strong>.<ul>
<li><strong>In India</strong>, employees are entitled to a host of benefits under the Minimum Wages Act 1948, EPF Act 1952 and the Payment of Bonus Act 1965.</li>
<li>Similarly, <strong>contract labourers</strong> are governed under the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act 1970 and are entitled to benefits under the EPF.</li>
<li>However, gig workers display <strong>characteristics of both employees and independent contractors</strong> → as a result fall outside the ambit of statutory benefits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the proposed law for gig workers?</strong> In keeping with the National Commission on Labour’s recommendation to consolidate central labour laws, the Ministry of Labour and Employment introduced <strong>the Code on Social Security 2020.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Salient provisions in the Code on Social Security 2020:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It brings gig workers within the ­ambit of labour laws for the first time.</li>
<li>I<strong>t distinguishes between such workers and employees</strong>.</li>
<li>It stipulates that Central and State Governments <strong>must frame suitable social security schemes for gig workers</strong>.</li>
<li>A <strong>social security fund</strong> for gig workers, to which Gig employers must contribute 1-2% of their annual turnover → <strong>to be used for the aforementioned schemes.</strong></li>
<li>It also mandates the <strong>compulsory registration of all gig workers</strong> to avail of benefits under these schemes.</li>
<li>It also envisages the constitution of a <strong>National Social Security Board</strong> by the Central government to monitor the implementation of such schemes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Concerns:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Out of the four new labour codes proposed, <strong>gig work finds reference only in the Code on Social Security</strong>.</li>
<li>Hence, they <strong>cannot create legally recognised unions and access a national minimum wage</strong> that applies to all forms of employment.</li>
<li>Gig workers are excluded from the category of ‘unorganised workers’ or ‘wage workers’.</li>
<li>Gig workers also remain <strong>excluded from accessing the specialised redressal mechanism</strong> against their employers.</li>
<li>They also do not have the <strong>right to collective bargaining</strong> – a fundamental principle of modern labour law.</li>
<li>All the above leads to the violation of their fundamental rights under <strong>Articles 14 and 21</strong> and comes within the meaning of <strong>forced labour under Article 23.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Can judicial intervention be expected?</strong> A petition demanding that <strong>gig workers or platform workers be declared as ‘unorganised workers’</strong> so that they come under the purview of the Unorganised Workers’ Social Security Act, 2008, is pending in the SC of India.</p>
<p><strong>Best practices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In 2021, the <strong>UK Supreme Court</strong> classified Uber drivers as ‘workers’ under the UK Employment Rights Act 1996.</li>
<li><strong>Germany’s</strong> Temporary Employment Act provides for equal pay and equal treatment of gig workers.</li>
<li><strong>Singapore</strong> has also proposed legislative changes to extend work injury insurance and pension coverage to such workers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead for India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Labour Codes need to be implemented as soon as possible.</li>
<li>For this, State governments should frame rules as soon as possible.</li>
