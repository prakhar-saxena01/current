<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Malaiyaha Tamil community in Sri Lanka has released a declaration calling for <strong>greater recognition, political rights, and improved living and working conditions</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Who are Malaiyaha Tamil community?</strong></p>
<p>The Malaiyaha Tamil community refers to a <strong>historically marginalized group</strong> in Sri Lanka who migrated from southern India <strong>around 200 years ago</strong> to work in British-run plantations. They mainly work in <strong>tea and rubber estates</strong>, contributing significantly to Sri Lanka’s foreign exchange earnings. Their population is roughly <strong>around 10 lakhs</strong> (out of which around <strong>1.5 lakh people</strong> work in tea and rubber estates)</p>
<p><strong>Problems faced by the Malaiyaha Tamil community in Sri Lanka:</strong></p>

<td><strong>Problems</strong></td>
<td><strong>Specific Examples</strong></td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Structural Exclusion</strong></td>
<td>Limited access to <strong>resources and opportunities</strong> compared to other communities. <strong>Poor human development indices</strong> compared to other communities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Discrimination and Exploitation</strong></td>
<td>Deprived of <strong>citizenship rights until 2003</strong>. Subjected to <strong>discrimination and exploitation</strong> in various aspects of life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Inadequate Living Conditions</strong></td>
<td>Many families still reside in <strong>colonial-era line rooms</strong> without basic amenities.  A UN body  highlighted in 2021 that the community is living in <strong>“inhumane and degrading” conditions</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Economic Distress</strong></td>
<td>The financial crisis in Sri Lanka further exacerbated their economic hardships. <strong>More than half the populatio</strong>n living in estate areas is pushed into <strong>acute poverty.</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Low wages</strong></td>
<td>Their daily wage of <strong>LKR 1,000 (about ₹373</strong>) is tied to the target of <strong>18-22 kg of plucked tea leaves every day</strong>, while braving leeches and wasp attacks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Limited Political Representation</strong></td>
<td><strong>Lack of recognition</strong> as a distinct identity and equal citizens. Demand for <strong>appropriate political power</strong> sharing and proportional electoral arrangements.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>To alleviate these problems, the Malaiyaha Tamil community has released a declaration demanding the following:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Design, resource, and implement a 10-year development plan</strong> based on affirmative action to address decades of structural exclusion.</li>
<li><strong>Reduce poverty, provide land and housing</strong>, and enhance public health and education access.</li>
<li><strong>Ensure labour rights</strong>, including fair living wages and legal protection.</li>
<li>Recognize the Malaiyaha Tamils as a community with a <strong>distinct identity</strong> and <strong>equal citizenship.</strong></li>
<li>Establish appropriate <strong>political power sharing</strong> and a proportional system of electoral arrangements.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Assistance provided by India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Grant projects cut across sectors such as <strong>education, health, livelihood, housing, and industrial</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>Indian Housing Project</strong> aims to build <strong>50,000 houses in war-affected</strong> areas and estate workers in the plantation areas. However, the progress on it has been slow.</li>
<li>India now offers <strong>about 710 scholarship slots</strong> annually to Sri Lankan students.</li>
<li>The reconstruction work of a <strong>century-old railway track</strong> in <strong>northern Sri Lanka</strong>under India’s assistance</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>India and the International community must pressure Sri Lanka into providing the community with <strong>greater recognition, political rights, and improved living and working conditions</strong> through affirmative action and long-term development plans.</p>

<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Important International Institutions, agencies and fora – their Structure, Mandate</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/health/health-for-all-who-launches-first-ever-roadmap-to-link-health-with-sustainable-economic-growth-89525"><strong>DTE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The 76th <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/05/23/world-health-assembly-wha/">World Health Assembly</a> (WHA) is being held in Geneva (Switzerland) with the theme: <strong>WHO at 75: Saving lives, driving health for all</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>WHO and WHA:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>WHO:</strong> Since 1948, the World Health Organization (WHO) – the UN specialized health agency, leads and championed global efforts to give everyone, everywhere a safe and healthy life.</li>
<li><strong>WHA:</strong> It is the <strong>main decision-making body</strong> of WHO and comprises <strong>194 Member States</strong>. Every year, delegates from all Member States come together (generally in May) to agree on the Organisation’s priorities and policies.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Highlights of the 76th WHA:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Health for All: Transforming economies to deliver what matters report:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was launched by the WHO Council on the Economics of Health for All – formed in 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
</li>
<li>The report provides <strong>a roadmap to focus on the links between health and sustainable, inclusive and innovation-led economic growth.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>It recommended reorienting economies to deliver health for all across four interrelated themes:</strong> </p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/valuing.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/valuing.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Significance:</strong> Instead of health for all being seen as the servant of economic growth → <strong>roadmap will structure economic activity</strong> in a way that will allow all people faster with better access to essential health services.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Pandemic treaty:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Negotiations on <strong>new rules for dealing with pandemics</strong> are underway at the WHA.</p>
</li>
<li>The WHO already has binding rules known as the <strong>International Health Regulations</strong> – adopted in <strong>2005 after the SARS outbreak.</strong></li>
<li>These regulations are still considered appropriate for <strong>regional epidemics</strong>, such as Ebola but inadequate for a global pandemic.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What is the so-called Pandemic treaty?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It should be a <strong>legally binding</strong> treaty (proposed by the EU and to be adopted by May 2024) for those who sign up.</li>
<li>It would be <strong>only the second such health accord</strong> after the <strong>2003 Framework Convention on Tobacco Control</strong> – a treaty that aims to reduce smoking via taxation and rules on labelling and advertising.</li>
<li><strong>Developing countries</strong>, especially in Africa, are keen to use the negotiations to secure better access to vaccines.</li>
<li>However, the proposed treaty has come under fire as <strong>critics warn that it could lead to countries ceding authority to the WHO</strong>.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> For the 2nd time in a decade, the UN-backed <strong>Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)</strong> deferred the accreditation of the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/statutory-regulatory-and-various-quasi-judicial-bodies/national-human-rights-commission/#:~:text=It%20is%20responsible%20for%20the,embodied%20in%20the%20International%20Covenants%E2%80%9D.">National Human Rights Commission</a>, India (NHRC-India).</p>
<p><strong>GANHRI:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>They were defined in 1991 and were adopted by the UN Human Rights Commission (1992) and the UN General Assembly (<strong>1993</strong>).</li>
<li>They provide the <strong>international benchmarks against which NHRI can be accredited</strong>.</li>
<li>They set out <strong>6 main criteria</strong> that NHRIs are required to meet. These are:<ul>
<li>mandate and competence;</li>
<li>autonomy from the government;</li>
<li>independence guaranteed by a statute or Constitution;</li>
<li>pluralism;</li>
<li>adequate resources; and</li>
<li>adequate powers of investigation.</li>

</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Importance of GANHRI accreditation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Institutions accredited with “<strong>A status</strong>” means full compliance with the <strong>Paris Principles</strong>.</li>
<li>It is the <strong>only non-UN body</strong> whose internal accreditation system grants access to UN committees – speaking rights and seating at <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/10/14/importance-of-human-rights/">human rights</a> treaty bodies.</li>

<p><strong>Why is the accreditation NHRC-India deferred?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of independence (political interference in appointments).</li>
<li>Lack of diversity (in staff and leadership) and accountability.</li>
<li>Insufficient action to protect marginalised communities, religious minorities, and human rights defenders.</li>
<li>Involving the police in probes into human rights violations.</li>
<li>Poor cooperation with civil society.</li>
<li>All of the above is contrary to the ‘<strong>Paris Principles</strong>’.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Its decisions <strong>should be made enforceable</strong> by the government.</li>
<li>Members of NHRCs should include <strong>civil society, human rights activists</strong>, etc.</li>

<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/07/02/editorial-analysis-gst-five-years-stronger/"><strong>About GST:</strong></a></p>
<p>GST (introduced <strong>on July 1, 2017) is a</strong> multi-stage collection mechanism and aims to be a <strong>unified indirect tax</strong> across the country on products and services. The objectives of GST include <strong>simplifying the tax system, preventing misclassifications and litigations</strong>, avoiding an <strong>inverted duty structure</strong>, and ensuring a destination-based consumption taxation approach.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation:</strong></p>
<p>GST is implemented through a <strong>dual GST model</strong>, with the <strong>Centre and States levying taxes</strong> on a common base. The rates for GST range from <strong>5%, 12%, 16% and 28%,</strong> and it applies to most goods and services<strong>, excluding alcoholic liquor for human consumption and five petroleum products (</strong>petroleum crude, motor spirit (petrol), high-speed diesel, natural gas and aviation turbine fuel<strong>).</strong> The <strong>GST Council</strong>, headed by the Union Finance Minister, is the governing body responsible for making key decisions regarding GST.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> According to the <strong>ITF Transport Outlook 2023</strong>, acting now and <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/06/26/decarbonizing-transport-project/">decarbonising transportation</a> can help in achieving the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>The ITF Transport Outlook 2023:</strong> It was released by the International Transport Forum (ITF) at the <strong>Leipzig Transport Summit</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>ITF:</strong> It is a <strong>think tank</strong> (administratively integrated with the OECD yet politically autonomous) for transport policy that organises the Annual Summit of transport ministers.</p>
<p><strong>Leipzig (Germany) Transport Summit:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Transport ministers from across 64 member countries of the ITF gathered under the event theme of <strong>‘Transport Enabling Sustainable Economies’.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The United Kingdom</strong> holds the current Presidency of the annual Summit.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Highlights of the ITF Transport Outlook 2023</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If action to decarbonise transport is accelerated, the transport sector can still <strong>reduce its CO2 emissions by about 80% over the next 25 years</strong> (compared to 2019).</li>
<li>This drop will enable <strong>limiting the global temperature increase</strong> to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels – the Paris Agreement goal.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reaching this high-ambition scenario requires:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A combination of <strong>complementary policies</strong> that avoid unnecessary transport activity.</li>
<li><strong>Shift to no-carbon transport</strong> and improve the efficiency of transport.</li>
<li>Scale up <strong>cost-competitive technologies</strong> and fuels to move people and goods with fewer emissions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advantage of reaching this high-ambition scenario:</strong> The total capital investment needs of core infrastructure (road, rail, airports and ports) will be 5% lower with ambitious policies in place than carrying on with business as usual.</p>
<p><strong>Policy recommendations:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Initiatives:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Decarbonising Transport initiative of the ITF:</strong> Promotes carbon-neutral mobility to help stop climate change.</li>
<li><strong>India:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Forum for Decarbonizing Transport:</strong> Launched by NITI Aayog and WRI India, the project aims at bringing down the peak level of GHG emissions (transport sector) in Asia.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Supreme Court has issued notices to the Ministry of Environment and Forests and the Assam government in response to a plea seeking the <strong>declaration of the area around Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary</strong> in Assam as an <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/28/eco-sensitive-zones-2/"><strong>eco-sensitive zone</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>What is an eco-sensitive zone?</strong></p>
<p>Eco-Sensitive Zones (ESZs) are <strong>designated areas surrounding national parks</strong> and wildlife sanctuaries that are deemed <strong>ecologically fragile and important</strong> for the conservation of wildlife and their habitats.</p>
<p><strong>Areas mandated under ESZ:</strong></p>
<p>MoEFCC has mandated the <strong>declaration of land within 10 km of the park or sanctuary</strong> boundaries as ESZs under the <strong>Environmental (Protection) Act, 1986</strong>. However, the application of the 10-km rule can vary, and areas beyond 10 km can also be notified as ESZs if they contain <strong>significant ecological corridors</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Categorization of Activities:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prohibited:</strong> Commercial mining, sawmills, polluting industries, major hydroelectric projects, and commercial use of wood</li>
<li><strong>Regulated activities</strong> include tree felling, the establishment of hotels and resorts, commercial use of natural water, the erection of electrical cables, and drastic changes in agricultural practices.</li>
<li><strong>Permitted activities in ESZs</strong> include ongoing agricultural or horticultural practices, rainwater harvesting, organic farming, the use of renewable energy sources, and the adoption of green technology for all activities.</li>
