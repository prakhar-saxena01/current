<h4 id="gs-paper-1"><strong>GS Paper 1</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus: Geography: Ocean Current</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/antarctica-overturning-circulation-slowdown-alarm-bells/article66903987.ece#:~:text=Our%20measurements%20show%20the%20overturning,formation%20of%20Antarctic%20bottom%20water."><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The deep ocean currents (called ‘Overturning Circulations’) in Antarctica, which play a crucial role in redistributing heat, carbon, and nutrients around the globe, are slowing down earlier than predicted (as per the new research, published in the <strong>journal Nature Climate Change</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Finding:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Overturning circulation has <strong>slowed by almost a third (30%)</strong> and <strong>deep ocean oxygen levels</strong> are declining.</li>
<li>These changes were expected by 2050, but are already happening</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are the Overturning Circulations?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Overturning Circulations</strong> refers to the global network of ocean currents that redistribute heat, carbon, and nutrients. They play a crucial role in regulating Earth’s climate, maintaining oxygen levels, and shaping ocean currents.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/surface.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/surface.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Why are the Overturning Circulations slowing?</strong></p>
<p>The Overturning Circulations are slowing due to <strong>melting Antarctic ice,</strong> which freshens surface waters and reduces their density, hindering the sinking process and disrupting the circulation pattern.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of ‘the Slowing’:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It can lead to <strong>reduced oxygen levels in the deep ocean</strong>, affecting marine organisms.</li>
<li><strong>Disrupts the base of the food chain:</strong>As the Southern Ocean supports about <strong>three-quarters</strong> of <strong>global phytoplankton production</strong> → impacts the marine ecosystem.</li>
<li>It can also <strong>intensify global warming</strong> by reducing the ocean’s capacity to store carbon dioxide and heat.</li>
<li>It can <strong>contribute to rising sea levels</strong> due to the thermal expansion of warmer waters.</li>
</ul>

<td>DWC refers to the <strong>movement of water in the deep ocean</strong>, driven by density differences caused by temperature and salinity variations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Formation</strong></td>
<td>In polar regions, sea ice formation causes surrounding seawater to become saltier and denser, <strong>leading to sinking</strong>. The process repeats as surface water is pulled in to replace sinking water. This circulation pattern is known as <strong>thermohaline circulation.</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Significance</strong></td>
<td>Heat Distribution; Carbon Dioxide Control; Shapes ocean currents and circulation patterns globally;  Affects sea level by redistributing heat and influencing thermal expansion</td>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> According to a new UN report – <strong>Hunger Hotspots – FAO-WFP early warnings on acute food insecurity –</strong> India’s neighbours (Pakistan, Afghanistan and Myanmar) are among the hunger hotspots in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights of the report:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Many hotspots</strong> [Afghanistan, Nigeria, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Yemen, Haiti, and the Sahel (Burkina Faso and Mali)] are facing growing hunger crises.</li>
<li><strong>Conflict, climate extremes and economic shocks</strong> continue to drive more and more communities into crisis.</li>
<li><strong>The spillover from the crisis in Sudan</strong> is driving massive population displacement and hunger among people in search of refuge.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Risks ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deepening economic shocks and a likely El Nino climatic phenomenon</strong> is raising fears of climate extremes in vulnerable countries around the globe.</li>
<li><strong>Acute food insecurity</strong> can potentially increase in magnitude and severity.</li>

<p><strong>Case of India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Global Hunger Index 2022</strong> ranks India 107 (out of 121 countries), and the level of hunger and undernutrition in the country is now at “<strong>serious</strong>” levels.</li>
<li>India’s rank on this index has been <strong>worsening since 2020</strong> – 94 in 2020 and 101 in 2021.</li>
<li><strong>With 19.3%</strong>, India has the highest rate of child wasting (among under 5 children) in the world.</li>
<li><strong>About 16.3%</strong> <strong>of Indians are undernourished</strong>, and about one in every three children is stunted.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hunger-1.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hunger-1.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Real problem:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>India is the largest producer</strong> of milk, pulses, bananas, and the <strong>2nd-largest producer</strong> of wheat, rice, and vegetables in the world.</li>
<li>Therefore, poor hunger indices can be attributed mainly to <strong>food losses and wastage</strong> in India.</li>
<li>Crops lost between post-harvest and the retailer (due to <strong>poor storage, handling, and transportation</strong>) are referred to as losses. <strong>Food wastage</strong> is the loss of food at the consumer’s end.</li>
<li>Anywhere <strong>between 1% (in the case of milk) to 16% (guava)</strong> of the agricultural produce is lost by the time it reaches the retailer.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead for India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>By providing farmers with a mechanism to <strong>access real-time prices</strong>, processing to absorb ‘excess’ production and scientific storages like <strong>silos and logistical support.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Innovations and investments</strong>, both public and private, are key to addressing the food loss and waste challenges. <strong>For example,</strong><ul>
<li><strong>GreenPod Labs is innovating in the packaging and storing</strong> of produce to augment their shelf life.</li>
<li><strong>Dehaat</strong> provides an online marketplace to farmers and buyers that reduces the number of hands the food trades in.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> According to a UN report, India’s pilot studies on <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/02/01/fortified-rice-3/">rice fortification</a> showed a significant drop in the prevalence of anaemia among schoolchildren.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/01/25/food-fortification/#:~:text=Food%20fortification%20is%20defined%20as,to%20increase%20their%20nutritional%20value."><strong>Food Fortification</strong></a><strong>:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Meaning:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is defined as the practice of <strong>adding vitamins and minerals</strong> to commonly consumed foods during processing to increase their nutritional value.</li>
<li>Food fortification has been identified as the strategy by the WHO and FAO for <strong>decreasing the incidence of nutrient deficiencies</strong> at the global level.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The scenario in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/10/15/global-hunger-index-3/">The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2022</a> placed <strong>India at 107th position</strong> (out of 121 nations) and the <strong>undernourished population</strong> is one of the primary reasons for this poor performance of India.</li>
<li><strong>In 2016,</strong> the <strong>FSSAI</strong> <strong>established standards</strong> for the fortification of rice, wheat flour, edible oil, double-fortified salt (DFS) and milk. It <strong>developed the ‘+F’ logo</strong> and helped build capacity for food producers.</li>
<li>The pilot – <strong>public food fortification programme</strong>, was launched in <strong>2019</strong> by the FSSAI in partnership with external non-profits, who are also associated with the nutraceutical industry.</li>
<li>Fortified foods are now being <strong>included in public food schemes</strong> like PDS, ICDS, and Mid-Day Meal Scheme/Poshan, helping to address the <strong>challenge of</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/issues-related-to-children/malnutrition/#:~:text=Malnutrition%20in%20India%20accounts%20for,under%20the%20age%20of%20five."><strong>malnutrition</strong></a><strong>.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong> Fortification may contribute to the <strong>prevention, reduction and control of micronutrient deficiencies</strong> through mass fortification or targeted fortification.</p>
<p><strong>Major issues with food fortification:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The one-sided portrayal of fortification as a ‘cure-all’:</strong> Without any significant scientific perspective and evidence on fortification.</li>
<li><strong>No independent risk analysis:</strong> FSSAI’s statutory regulations caution against consuming iron-fortified food by patients with thalassemia and sickle cell anaemia.</li>
<li><strong>Conflict of interest:</strong> The studies which FSSAI relies on to promote fortification are sponsored by private food companies.</li>
<li><strong>Evaluation studies are still not publicly available.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Case of treating iron deficiency anaemia in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Iron is an essential mineral required for many bodily functions, including the formation of haemoglobin, but <strong>can be harmful when taken in excess</strong> (tolerable upper limit – 40 mg/day).</li>
<li>One of the methods suggested for the <strong>treatment of iron deficiency is fortification of food with iron.</strong></li>
<li><strong>As men cannot ‘excrete’ iron</strong> from the body (unlike women), they are particularly vulnerable to excess iron intake.</li>
<li>Studies have shown that unabsorbed iron can lead to <strong>constipation, and diarrhoea</strong> and has been closely linked to many chronic comorbidities like <strong>diabetes, and</strong> liver fibrosis/cirrhosis.</li>
<li><strong>It can impair the absorption of other minerals</strong> such as zinc and copper, which are also essential for the body and lead to <strong>other deficiencies.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fortification should be pushed in a transparent manner.</li>
<li>To treat <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/17/acute-malnutrition-risking-30-million-childrens-lives-who/">undernutrition</a> in India, all three – <strong>dietary diversity, higher protein consumption and fortification</strong>, are essential.</li>
<li>It is <strong>imperative to develop individualised strategies</strong> and ensure thorough monitoring to detect any adverse events at the earliest.</li>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: Twitter has decided to leave the <strong>EU’s disinformation code</strong>, a voluntary pact that groups together the major social platforms.</p>
<p>A new law the <strong>Digital Services Act (DSA)</strong> is set to take effect – which establishes <strong>requirements for monitoring and flagging disinformation</strong>, which would make the <strong>now voluntary agreement mandatory for large social media sites.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reason:</strong> </p>
<p>Twitter wants to <strong>avoid certain legal liabilities</strong> that come with being part of the code. By leaving the code, Twitter may be able to <strong>operate more independently and on its own terms</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>About DSA:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>The DSA, <strong>an expansion of the current voluntary agreement</strong>, will <strong>require large digital platforms like Twitter to monitor and demonetize disinformation</strong> and bot farms on their sites, offer transparent warnings about political advertising, and empower fact-checking.</li>
<li>It <strong>does not require the site to remove content but does require offering users ways to report illicit content</strong></li>

<p>The <strong>UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</strong> recognizes the need to remove billions of tonnes of carbon annually to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/foucault-pendulum-new-parliament-building-ncsm-kolkata/article66904653.ece#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20features%20of%20the%20new%20Parliament,the%20National%20Council%20of%20Science%20Museums%20%28NCSM%29%2C%20Kolkata."><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context: A Foucault pendulum has been installed inside the new Parliament which is</strong> designed by the National Council of Science Museums, Kolkata.</p>
<ul>
<li>Invented by <strong>French physicist Léon Foucault in the mid-19th Century</strong>, the pendulum provided the <strong>first laboratory demonstration in history to show that the Earth spins on its axis</strong>. The pendulum in the new Parliament is meant to symbolise the ‘<strong>integration of the idea of India with that of the universe’.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Foucault Pendulum:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The pendulum consists of a <strong>heavy bob suspended at the end of a long, strong wire from a fixed point in the ceiling</strong>. As the pendulum swings, the imaginary surface across which the wire and the bob swipe is called the plane of the swing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why is it important:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It helped us <strong>understand that the Earth is rotating or spinning</strong>. As it swings back and forth, it <strong>seems to change its direction over time.</strong></li>
<li>This happens because while the pendulum swings, <strong>the Earth is spinning beneath making it look like the pendulum is changing its direction</strong>. This effect is <strong>called the Coriolis effect.</strong> Depending on where you are on Earth, the pendulum will appear to rotate in different ways.</li>
<li>For example, if you’re in the Northern Hemisphere (like in Europe or North America), the pendulum will rotate clockwise. But if you’re in the Southern Hemisphere (like in Australia or South America), it will rotate counterclockwise.</li>
<li>By observing this rotation, <strong>scientists like Foucault were able to prove that the Earth is spinning on its axis.</strong></li>
</ul>
