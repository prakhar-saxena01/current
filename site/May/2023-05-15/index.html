<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Indian government has prepared a new Model Prisons Act to replace the current <strong>130-year-old ‘Prisons Act, 1894’</strong>, with a focus on rehabilitation and reform of prisoners instead of retributive deterrence.</p>
<p><strong>What is Criminal Justice System in India?</strong></p>
<p>The Criminal Justice System (CJS) in India is a set of <strong>legal and institutional frameworks</strong> that govern the detection, investigation, prosecution, and punishment of criminal offences.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The CJS in India is mainly guided by three major legal documents:</strong><ul>
<li>The Indian Penal Code</li>
<li>The Code of Criminal Procedure</li>
<li>The Indian Evidence Act.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>CJS has four subsystems:</strong><ul>
<li>Legislature (Parliament)</li>
<li>Enforcement (Police)</li>
<li>Adjudication (Courts)</li>
<li>Corrections (Prisons, Community Facilities)</li>

<tr>
<td><strong>Human rights violations</strong></td>
<td>E.g., custodial deaths, torture, and overcrowding are widespread in Indian prisons.</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Focus on rehabilitation</strong></td>
<td>The current prison system focuses more on punishment than rehabilitation, which leads to high recidivism rates (committing offence again).<br><br>A new act should emphasize the need for <strong>rehabilitation programs and better integration of prisoners into society upon release</strong>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Improved healthcare</strong></td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Technology integration</strong></td>
<td>The current prison system is <strong>largely manual and paper-based, leading</strong> to delays and inefficiencies.</td>

<td><strong>Staff training</strong></td>
<td>Many Indian prison <strong>staff lack adequate training, leading to incidents of human rights abuses,</strong> corruption, and mismanagement.<br><br>E.g., In 2020 it was reported that the <strong>Puzhal Central Prison in Chennai, Tamil Nadu</strong> had only <strong>one guard for every 100 prisoners.</strong></td>

<p><strong>Implementations:</strong> Prisons in India and <strong>‘persons detained therein’</strong> are a <strong>State subject</strong> and MPA 2023 will serve as a “<strong>guiding document</strong>” for States. Therefore it is <strong>not binding</strong> on the states.</p>
<p><strong>Previous other recommendations:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>SC appointed Justice Amitava Roy (retd.) The committee</strong> recommended several measures to address the issue including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speedy trials</li>
<li>Increasing the number of lawyers for prisoners</li>
<li>Setting up special fast-track courts for petty offences</li>
<li>Promoting the concept of plea bargaining</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Initiative for prison reforms in India:</strong></p>
<p>The Modernisation of Prisons Project (2021-26) aims to enhance security and facilitate prisoner rehabilitation in India through the use of modern security equipment; E-Prisons Project, Model Prison Manual 2016, and National Legal Services Authority (NALSA).</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>The Model Prison Act 2023 is aimed at improving prison administration and conditions, protecting the rights of prisoners, and promoting their rehabilitation and reintegration into society. It is expected to bring much-needed reforms to the Indian prison system and align it with international standards.</p>

<p><strong>About the Report:</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Global Report on Internal Displacement 2023 (GRID-2023),</strong> published by the <strong>Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC),</strong> is the world’s leading source of data and analysis on Internal Displacement (ID).  The 2023 edition sheds light on the significant increase in the number of people displaced by disasters in 2022 and the complex relationships between disasters, conflict and violence, food security and ID.</p>
<p><strong>IDMC (formed 1998; HQ: Geneva</strong>) is an <strong>International non-governmental organization</strong> established in 1998 by the <strong>Norwegian Refugee Council</strong> in Geneva. It is focused on <strong>monitoring and providing information</strong> and analysis on the world’s internally displaced persons.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>There is a need for India to <strong>formulate policies and strategies</strong> that are focused on migration, promote inclusive growth and development, and reduce distress-induced migration.</p>
<p><strong>1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol</strong> assert the <strong>principle of non-refoulment</strong> (a refugee should not be returned to a country where they face serious threats to their life or freedom)</p>

<h4 id="facts-for-prelims-ffp_3"><strong>Facts for Prelims (FFP)</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/national/centre-fixes-price-for-drugs-going-off-patent/article66842922.ece"><strong>HBL</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The government has introduced a formula to <strong>determine the pricing of medicines</strong> that are losing their <strong>patent exclusivity</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Patents in India:</strong></p>
<p>A patent for drugs in India gives the patent holder exclusive rights to manufacture, use, sell, or import the patented drug in India for a specified period, <strong>typically 20 years</strong> from the date of filing the patent application.</p>
<p><strong>Prices of Medicine in India:</strong></p>
<p><strong>National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA)</strong> (under the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizer) has been established to fix/revise prices of medicines under the Drugs (Prices Control) Order (DPCO), 2013.</p>
<p><strong>The new formula:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>For the off-patent price of a medicine (patented under the Patent Act, 1970):</strong> It will be capped at 50% of its original cost. After one-year ceiling price will <strong>be revised again based on market data.</strong></li>
<li><strong>For Generic version:</strong> When generic versions become available, the price will be determined based on the <strong>average price of similar versions.</strong></li>
<li><strong>For Fixed Dose Combinations (FDC),</strong> where one component is going off patent, the ceiling price will be revised to <strong>50% of the current ceiling price</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>For innovative drugs not available in India</strong>: An expert committee will decide the price cap.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance of the move</strong>: The move aims to <strong>streamline pricing and encourage competition</strong> in the market. Also, it will reduce the prices of the <strong>patented drugs</strong> which are a part of the <strong>National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Concerns</strong>: Civil society representatives have raised concerns about the potential for increased prices by <strong>generic manufacturers</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> An intermediate configuration of a <strong>2000 kN semi-cryogenic engine</strong> was recently tested at a <strong>newly commissioned Semi-cryogenic Integrated Engine &amp; Stage Test facility at ISRO Propulsion Complex (IPRC)</strong> in Mahendragiri, Tamil Nadu by ISRO.</p>
<ul>
<li>It was the <strong>first in a series of tests planned</strong> to validate the design of a <strong>propellant feed system, including low-pressure and high-pressure turbo-pumps, gas generator, and control components.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About semi-cryogenic engines:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Semi-cryogenic engines are <strong>a type of rocket engine that use a combination of liquid and gaseous propellants.</strong> They are called “<strong>semi-cryogenic</strong>” because they <strong>operate at temperatures higher</strong> than cryogenic engines but still <strong>colder than traditional liquid rocket engines.</strong></li>
<li>A semi-cryogenic engine uses <strong>refined kerosene instead of liquid hydrogen</strong>. Liquid oxygen is used as an oxidizer.</li>
<li>The Semi Cryogenic Propulsion System Project envisages the <strong>design and development of a 2000 kN semi-cryogenic engine and ‘SC120 stage’</strong> that will enable the <strong>development of a heavy-lift capability for future Indian space transportation systems.</strong></li>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: India begins <strong>regulating the captive breeding of exotic animals</strong> through a licensing system.</p>
<ul>
<li>Those who breed exotic species protected under (CITES) and listed in Appendix 1 of Schedule IV of the Wildlife Protection Act 2022 can now <strong>obtain Breeders of Species Licence under the Breeders of Species Licence Rules,2023.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Appendix 1 of Schedule IV is endangered exotic animals</strong> (Red Panda, various species of dogs, wolves, cats, apes, chimpanzees, gibbons) and plants, and import rules are stricter for them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is Captive Breeding?</strong></p>
<p>Captive breeding refers to the <strong>practice of breeding and raising wild animals in controlled environments</strong>, such as zoos, wildlife centres, or specialized facilities, with the purpose of <strong>conserving and protecting</strong> endangered or threatened species.</p>
<ul>
<li>The goal of <strong>captive breeding programs</strong> is to increase the population size of rare species and, if possible, reintroduce individuals back into their natural habitats.</li>
</ul>
<p>Captive breeding of exotic species protected under CITES <strong>was not regulated in the Indian laws until the recent amendment to the Wildlife (Protection) Amendment Act 2022.</strong></p>
