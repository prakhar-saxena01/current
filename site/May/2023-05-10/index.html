<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>About</strong></td>
<td>He was a Bengali polymath who worked as a poet, writer, playwright, composer, philosopher, social reformer and painter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Philosophies</strong></td>
<td>He propagated ideas of <strong>humanism, idealism, nationalism and internationalism.</strong><br><br>One of the most remarkable institutions established by Tagore – <strong>Visva Bharati University (1921)</strong> – ushered in a new era of <strong>Indian nationalism</strong> (incorporating all the best aspects of Western culture into the best of Indian culture).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Contributions</strong></td>
<td><strong>As a freedom fighter:</strong><br><br> For him, <strong>true freedom</strong> means the ability to be truthful and honest with oneself otherwise autonomy loses all of its worth.<br><br>He viewed British rule as a symptom of the <strong>overall “sickness” of the social “disease” of the public.</strong><br><br> He wrote the song ‘<strong>Banglar Mati Banglar Jol’</strong> (Soil of Bengal, Water of Bengal) to unite the Bengali population after the <strong>Bengal partition in 1905.</strong><br><br>He actively participated in the <strong>Swadeshi movement (1905).</strong> Being shocked when it broke into communal violence, he withdrew from the movement.<br><br> He wrote the <strong>‘Amar Sonar Bangla’</strong> (adopted as the national anthem of Bangladesh later) and <strong>‘Jana Gana Mana’</strong> (adopted as the national anthem of independent India later) which helped ignite a feeling of nationalism amongst people.<br><br>For Hindu-Muslim unity, he started the <strong>Rakhi festival</strong>.<br><br><strong>He renounced the Knighthood</strong> in protest of the <strong>Jallianwala Bagh massacre (1919)</strong>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>As a social reformer:</strong><br><br> He constantly questioned the importance of caste in India’s discourse.<br><br>In his poem – ‘The Sacred Touch’ (in the Harijan) and drama – ‘Chandalika’, he <strong>shunned untouchability as being inhumane</strong>.<br><br>His works – <strong>Chokher Bali</strong> (on themes like widowhood, patriarchy and child marriage), <strong>Maanbhajan</strong>, and <strong>Aparichita</strong> (shunning the practice of dowry) – touched upon almost all the social evils of that time.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Works</strong></td>
<td>He published his first poems at the age of 16 under the pen name <strong>‘Bhanusimha’</strong>.<br><br>His notable works include <strong>Gitanjali, Ghare-Baire, Gora, Manasi, Balaka, and Sonar Tori</strong>. He is also remembered for his song ‘<strong>Ekla Chalo Re</strong>’.<br><br>For all his contributions he is widely known as ‘<strong>Kavi guru</strong>’.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Tagore vs Gandhi</strong></td>
<td>He was a <strong>good friend</strong> of Mahatma Gandhi and is said to have given him the title of <strong>Mahatma</strong>.<br><br><strong>However, both disagreed on key issues at times.</strong><br><br><strong>For example,</strong> Tagore sharply criticised Gandhi, after he blamed the prevalence of untouchability for the massive earthquake in Bihar.<br><br>Tagore renounced British imperialism, yet he did not fully support or agree with Gandhi and his <strong>Non-cooperation movement.</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Awards</strong></td>
<td>In <strong>1913</strong> he became the first non-European to have won the <strong>Nobel Prize in Literature</strong> for his novel ‘Geetanjali’.<br><br><strong>Knighthood</strong> was given to him by Lord Hardinge in 1915.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Relevance today</strong></td>
<td>Tagore’s ideas on nationalism, humanism, internationalism and divinity stay as alive and relevant.</td>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The question of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) chief’s tenure is back in the Supreme Court of India.</p>
<p><strong>Explaining the issues:</strong></p>
<p>The tenure for <strong>directors</strong> of CBI and ED is <strong>two years</strong>. However, in November 2021, the President promulgated two <strong>ordinances</strong> allowing the Centre to extend the tenures <strong>from two years to up to five years.</strong> So, now they can be given three annual extensions. The Supreme Court had previously <strong>upheld this and allowed</strong> the extension of ED’s chief Sanjay Kumar Mishra, but said that such extension should be done in <strong>rare and exceptional cases</strong> and for a <strong>short period</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, the government <strong>has again extended the tenure of Mr Mishra</strong> citing a pending review by the Financial Action Task Force and that Mishra would not remain in service after his term comes to an end in November. This has been challenged in SC again.</p>

<td><strong>Misuse of PMLA for ordinary crimes</strong></td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Lack of transparency and clarity</strong></td>
<td>The <strong>Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR)</strong> is not given to the accused and the <strong>ED lacks clarity</strong> in selecting cases to investigate.</td>

<td><strong>Allegation of Political biases</strong></td>
<td>“Political figures who have crossed over to the government side have mysteriously been given <strong>‘clean chits’</strong> or have seen ED go slow in proceedings against them”</td>

</tbody>

<p><strong>Way forward:</strong></p>
<p>While the ED has been given <strong>expansive powers under PMLA,</strong> there must be a <strong>balance</strong> between these powers and adherence to <strong>constitutional provisions</strong> to prevent political misuse. The <strong>process of investigation should not become a punishment</strong>, and there should be a commitment to expeditiously resolve cases for <strong>speedy trials and convictions</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Constant scrutiny</strong> over the operations of the Enforcement Directorate is necessary, and any lacunas in the operative part can be filled through <strong>suitable legislation</strong>, executive action, or a revised order of the apex court.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> India <strong>has not implemented a law to recall bad drugs</strong> from the market since 1976, even though discussions have taken place on this topic several times over the years.</p>
<p><strong>What is a drug recall?</strong></p>
<p>A drug recall is the process of <strong>removing a prescription or over-the-counter drug</strong> from the market. A recall may occur if a medication is found to be defective, contaminated, or potentially harmful to the public.</p>
<p><strong>Drug regulation in India:</strong></p>

<p><strong>In India, drugs and cosmetics are regulated by:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Act: Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 and Rules 1945:</strong> It assigns various responsibilities to central and state regulators.</li>
<li><strong>Agencies:</strong></li>
<li><strong>Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI)</strong>: It is responsible for approving licenses for <strong>specified categories of drugs</strong>, setting standards for manufacturing, sales, import, and distribution of drugs in India, and heads the department of CDSCO.</li>
<li><strong>Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO)</strong>: It prescribes standards for ensuring the safety, efficacy, and quality of drugs, cosmetics, diagnostics, and devices. It also regulates the <strong>market authorization of new drugs</strong> and <strong>clinical trial standards.</strong></li>
<li><strong>National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA):</strong> It controls the pricing of pharmaceutical drugs in India</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Way forward:</strong></p>
<p>To create an effective recall mechanism, the responsibility of recalling drugs needs to be <strong>centralized under one authority</strong> with the legal power to hold companies liable for failures to recall drugs and search and seize batches of failed medicine.</p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-3"><strong>GS Paper 3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Indian Economy and issues relating to planning, mobilization of resources</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/rbis-hoard-of-gold-now-almost-800-tonnes-whats-behind-the-gold-rush-by-central-banks-8599547/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The RBI’s gold reserves <strong>touched 794.64 metric tonnes</strong> in fiscal 2023, an increase of nearly 5% over fiscal 2022.</p>
<p><strong>Gold reserves</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> It is the gold held by a national central bank.</li>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong><ul>
<li>A guarantee to redeem promises to pay depositors, note holders/paper money/trading peers, <strong>during the era of the</strong> <strong>gold standard –</strong> a monetary system (until 1971) in which the standard economic unit of account is based on a fixed quantity of gold.</li>
<li><strong>Currently</strong>, a store of value/ to support the value of the national currency.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why gold is used as a reserve in Central banks?</strong></p>
<p>Unlike fiat currencies, which can be subject to <strong>inflation or devaluation</strong> due to various economic factors, the value of gold tends to be <strong>relatively stable over time,</strong> which makes it an attractive asset for central banks to hold as a reserve. Additionally, gold is <strong>highly liquid</strong>, which means it can easily be converted into cash or used to settle international transactions.</p>
<p><strong>Composition of India’s gold reserves:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>794.</strong><strong>64</strong> tonnes of gold reserves included <strong>gold deposits</strong> of <strong>56.32</strong> tonnes.</li>
<li><strong>437.22</strong> tonnes of gold is held <strong>overseas</strong> in safe custody with the Bank of England and the Bank of International Settlements (BIS).</li>
<li><strong>301.10</strong> tonnes of gold is held <strong>domestically</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Comparing with total foreign exchange reserves:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/forex.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/forex.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>As on March 31 2023, India’s total foreign exchange (forex) reserves stood at <strong>$578.449 billion</strong>, and gold reserves were pegged at <strong>$45.2 billion</strong>.</li>
<li>Thus, the share of gold in the total forex increased from about 7% (March 2022) to about <strong>7.</strong><strong>81%.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why are these reserves increasing?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>RBI has been adding gold to its reserves <strong>to diversify its overall reserves.</strong><ul>
<li>This change in strategy has been driven by <strong>negative interest rates in the past, the weakening of the dollar,</strong> global uncertainty and rising inflation<strong>.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As gold is considered a more <strong>safe, secure and liquid asset</strong>, it can safeguard RBI’s returns.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are other central banks doing?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Many other central banks, including the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), etc., <strong>have been buying gold.</strong></li>
<li>The two key drivers behind the decision to hold gold – <strong>its performance during crisis times and its role as a long-term store of value.</strong></li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> CJI questioned an old Constitution Bench judgment – no court or State has the power to add/subtract/modify the Scheduled Tribes List – was not shown to the Manipur HC.</p>
<p><strong>Background: Violent clashes</strong> followed after a Single Judge Bench of the Manipur HC directed that the State government shall consider the case for the inclusion of the Meetei/Meitei community (in Manipur) in the ST list, expeditiously.</p>
<p><strong>Article 342 of the Indian Constitution:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clause (1): The President</strong> may, with respect to any State (after consultation with the Governor) or UT, by public notification, specify the tribes deemed to be ST in relation to that state or UT.</li>
<li><strong>Clause (2): The Parliament</strong> may by law include or exclude from the list of ST specified in the above notification.</li>
<li>The above Article also provides for listing of STs State/UT wise and not on an all-India basis.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Maharashtra versus Milind (2000) case:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A notification issued under Article 342 (1), specifying STs, <strong>can be amended only by law to be made by Parliament.</strong></li>
<li>In other words, inclusion/exclusion from the list of STs issued under Article 342 (1) <strong>can be made only by Parliament by law and by no other authority.</strong></li>
