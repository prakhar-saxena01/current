<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Indian society/Mechanisms, Laws, Institutions and Bodies constituted for the Protection and Betterment of these Vulnerable Sections</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/g20-countries-including-india-are-fuelling-modern-slavery-says-new-report/article66895654.ece#:~:text=The%20Global%20Slavery%20Index%202023,people%20living%20in%20'modern%20slavery'&amp;text=50%20million%20people%20are%20living,years%2C%20says%20a%20new%20report."><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> According to the Walk Free Foundation’s Global Slavery Index 2023, <strong>50 million people are living in conditions of</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/09/14/modern-slavery/">modern slavery</a> – a 25% rise over the last five years.</p>
<p><strong>Modern slavery:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It refers to situations of exploitation in that <strong>a person cannot refuse or leave</strong> because of threats, violence, coercion, or deception.</li>
<li>It manifests as <strong>forced labour, child labour, forced marriage</strong>, debt bondage, commercial sexual exploitation, human trafficking, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Global Slavery Index:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is <strong>an assessment of modern slavery conditions</strong> in 160 countries.</li>
<li>It uses data released by the <strong>International Labour Organisation (ILO), the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), etc</strong>.</li>
<li>The Index provides rankings across <strong>3 dimensions</strong>: Size of the problem (prevalence), Government response and Vulnerability (political instability, inequality).</li>
<li>The 2023 index is significant as <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/07/editorial-analysis-indias-g20-presidency/">India holds the G20 presidency</a> <strong>this year</strong>, with a focus on <strong>sustainable development and climate change mitigation</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Highlights of the Global Slavery Index 2023:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/most_prevelent.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/most_prevelent.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>50 million people</strong> were living in conditions of modern slavery on any given day in 2021.</li>
<li>The practice has become <strong>more prevalent over the last five years</strong> (a 25%/10 million rise), due to <strong>climate change, armed conflict, weak governance and COVID-19</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>G20 nations</strong> account for more than half of all people living in modern slavery because their trade operations and global supply chains allow for human rights abuses.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The situation within G20 nations: India</strong> tops the list with 11 million people working as forced labourers, followed by China, Russia, Indonesia, Turkey and the U.S.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SDG 8.7 [ending forced labour and modern slavery]:</strong> High prevalence of modern slavery and stagnating government action highlight the difficulty in achieving this goal by 2030.</li>
<li><strong>Sectors of the economy promote modern slavery:</strong> Like the textile industry promotes conditions of forced and unpaid work, lack of benefits (maternity leave), etc.</li>
<li><strong>Poor govt policies:</strong> For example, the “Sumangali” scheme in Tamil Nadu traps women and girls from marginalised locations to work in exploitative conditions in spinning mills.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>South-south cooperation</strong> to bring more transparency in value chains, social security for workers at all stages, and holding corporations accountable in multilateral and bilateral free trade agreements.</li>
<li><strong>Implementing stronger measures and legislations</strong> that prevent governments and businesses from sourcing goods and services linked to modern slavery.</li>
<li><strong>Embedding anti-slavery measures in climate change sustainability plans</strong>.</li>
<li>Providing primary and secondary education to children and tightening regulations around forced and child marriage.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: There is a growing trend of <strong>farmers in rice-growing states of India</strong> adopting the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/05/10/direct-seeding-of-rice-2/">direct-seeding method</a> for paddy cultivation.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons</strong>: With delays in rainfall and labour shortages, this method allows farmers to sow seeds without waiting for rain or spending time in nurseries.</p>

There is <strong>no nursery preparation</strong> or transplantation involved in this method.</p>
<p><strong>Technique</strong>:</p>
<p>In this technique, farmers <strong>level the land, provide one pre-sowing irrigation</strong>, and then sow the rice seeds <strong>directly into the field</strong> instead of transplanting seedlings.</p>

<p><strong>Limitations of DSR:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Weed Management Challenges</strong>: DSR often requires <strong>multiple sprays of weedicides</strong> to control weed growth. In comparison, <strong>flood irrigation in the traditional method</strong> acts as a natural weedicide.</li>
<li><strong>Vulnerability to Climate Extremes</strong>: DSR may be more susceptible to extreme weather conditions, such as high temperatures and deficient rainfall.</li>
<li><strong>Crop Residue Management</strong>: Unlike traditional agriculture, where rice straw is removed after harvest, DSR leaves the crop residue in the field.</li>
<li><strong>Variability in Yield:</strong> The success of DSR can vary depending on factors like farmer expertise, soil type, and environmental conditions.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Initial Learning Curve</strong>: Transitioning from traditional agriculture to DSR may require farmers to acquire new knowledge and skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>seed requirement for DSR is</strong> also higher than transplanting.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Land levelling is compulsory</strong> in DSR, therefore, increasing the cost.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/21/sansad-tv-genetic-modification-in-crops/">Genetically modified (GM) food</a> is viewed as a controversial as well as a science-based solution for a sustainable global food system.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges the world is facing – Conflict between</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-economy-3/agriculture/food-security-in-india/">food security</a> <strong>and environmental protection</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Agriculture</strong> is responsible for <strong>a quarter of the carbon emissions</strong> and the vast majority of the <strong>world’s biodiversity losses</strong>.</li>
<li>However, <strong>there is the need to increase food production</strong> (by 50%), as the world’s population keeps growing [will reach 10 billion in 2057 (as per UN estimates)].</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Approaches to achieving food security and mitigating</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/climate-change-and-associated-issues/">climate crisis</a><strong>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dietary changes</strong> to make consumption more sustainable.</li>
<li><strong>Better technologies</strong> to create more environmentally friendly methods of agriculture. <strong>Gene technologies</strong> are a crucial part of the strategy for a sustainable food system.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is GM food?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Genetically modified organisms</strong> (GMOs) are organisms that have altered DNA to change their properties.</li>
<li>Foods produced from or using GMOs are often referred to as GM foods/crops.</li>
<li><strong>GMOs were first introduced in the US in 1994</strong>, to prolong the shelf life of tomato plants.</li>
<li>Since then, GM <strong>soybeans, wheat and rice</strong> have been approved for agricultural use.</li>
<li>Currently, GM crop production uses <strong>~10% of the land</strong> as compared to non-GM crops.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Can improve</strong> yield, delay ripening to prolong their shelf life, builds resistance to disease/pests, frost, or drought, or adds nutrients.</li>
<li><strong>Can be modified to reduce carbon emissions</strong> and boost the sustainability of food production.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>GM controversy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Uncertainty</strong> (over-regulation) and <strong>concerns about safety</strong> (long-term impact on human-animal health and biodiversity).</li>
<li><strong>The monopoly of big corporations</strong> (like Monsanto) → expensive GM seeds.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>GM crops in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Indian farmers started cultivating <strong>Bt cotton</strong> – a pest-resistant, GM version of cotton, in 2002-03.<ul>
<li><strong>By 2014, around 96%</strong> of the area under cotton cultivation in India was Bt cotton, making India the <strong>4th-largest cultivator of GM crops by acreage</strong> and the 2nd largest producer of cotton.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) cleared</strong> the environmental release of <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/11/29/whats-the-hurry-for-gm-mustard/">mustard hybrid Dhara Mustard Hybrid (DMH-11)</a> for its seed production and testing</li>
<li>Indian scientists have also developed <strong>strains of Sub-1 rice</strong>, which are much more resistant to flooding.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/02/23/why-bangladesh-sees-golden-rice-as-a-threat/">Golden rice</a> is a GM strain modified to contain <strong>vitamin A</strong>, to combat the shortage of dietary vitamin A in parts of Asia and Africa.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The focus of <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/11/14/editorial-analysis-the-gene-revolution/">GM products</a> must be on the <strong>social and public enterprise.</strong></li>
<li>The industry must look at <strong>more local solutions</strong> that help smallholder farmers in developing countries.</li>
<li>Easy availability of <strong>open-source seeds and GM technologies</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Creating a licensing landscape</strong> that empowers local farmers to adapt to the demands of <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-economy-3/inclusive-growth-and-issues-arising-from-it/recent-actions-taken-to-usher-inclusive-growth-in-the-economy-in-the-below-domains/sustainable-and-inclusive-agricultural-growth/">sustainable agriculture</a>, to meet rising populations and climate change.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Amid fresh <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/05/issues-in-manipur/">violence in Manipur</a>, the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/15/what-is-the-soo-agreement-with-tribal-insurgent-groups-that-the-manipur-govt-withdrew-from/">Kuki</a> National Organisation (KNO) has countered the claims of the Manipur CM that 40 insurgents had been killed by security forces.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/district.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/district.jpg?is-pending-load=1" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>How did violent clashes start?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Violence erupted in the Kuki-dominated</strong> Churachandpur district, where members of the Kuki tribe were protesting against the Meitei community’s demands to be designated as a “Scheduled Tribe”.</li>
<li>The tribes believe granting <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/10/power-to-direct-changes-in-sts-list/">ST status to the Meiteis</a> <strong>would be an infringement of their rights</strong> as they claim to be the marginalised part of the population.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>History of conflict in Manipur:</strong> Manipur has been in the <strong>cross-currents of India’s oldest</strong> <strong>insurgent movement</strong> – The Naga national movement in the 1950s.</p>
<p><strong>The Valley insurgent groups:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In 1964</strong>, the United National Liberation Front (UNLF) was formed, demanding secession from India.</li>
<li>Subsequently, <strong>numerous Meitei insurgent groups</strong> (PREPAK, PLA) came into being, which received arms and training from China.</li>
<li>These groups operated with a dual purpose – i<strong>ndependence from India, and warding off Naga insurgent groups.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Kuki-Zomi insurgent groups:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It started as a defence against aggression by other groups, <strong>but quickly turned to a call for</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/03/05/insights-into-editorial-the-history-of-the-kuki-insurgency-in-manipur/">Kukiland</a> – an imagined country spreading across the Kuki-Zomi inhabited areas of India, Myanmar and Bangladesh.</li>
<li>Over time, <strong>this was diluted to simply a call for a separate state</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Government reaction:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/04/29/armed-forces-special-powers-act-afspa-7/">Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) 1958</a> was enacted and <strong>extended to the entire state.</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>1980s, Manipur was declared a disturbed area</strong>.</li>
<li>A tripartite <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/15/what-is-the-soo-agreement-with-tribal-insurgent-groups-that-the-manipur-govt-withdrew-from/"><strong>Suspension of Operation (SoO)</strong></a> agreement between the Centre, the state and the Kuki-Zomi groups was signed in <strong>2008</strong>.</li>
<li>As the law-and-order situation gradually improved, <strong>AFSPA has been repealed in several areas.</strong></li>
<li>However, <strong>the Valley insurgent groups</strong> (like the UNLF, which is considered the mother of all Meitei insurgent groups) <strong>have never entered an agreement</strong> with the Centre<strong>.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Insurgent groups in society and politics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The insurgent groups are <strong>intricately woven into daily life in Manipur</strong>.<ul>
<li>They conduct <strong>strikes, and impose moral codes</strong> such as a ban on Hindi movies and music, etc.</li>
<li>The groups also levy <strong>‘taxes’</strong> on the public.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The groups are most visible today in the political life of the state. Candidates, cutting across party lines, stand for <strong>elections with insurgent backing, and the groups dictate to the voters who should win.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Physicists once doubted the existence of <strong>gravitational waves until Richard Feynman</strong> (an American theoretical physicist) settled the debate with a thought experiment.</p>
<p>Albert Einstein had discovered the theory of <strong>general relativity in 1915,</strong> including the existence of gravitational waves, but he was sceptical. The debate continued for decades until Feynman (in 1957) proposed a simple <strong>thought experiment that demonstrated how</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/08/ligo-india/#:~:text=What%20are%20Gravitational%20Waves%3F,or%20collide%20with%20each%20other"><strong>gravitational waves</strong></a> could transfer energy, resolving the confusion. Feynman’s argument convinced many physicists, inspiring further research on gravitational waves. In 2016, scientists finally announced the <strong>first direct detection of</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/08/ligo-india/#:~:text=What%20are%20Gravitational%20Waves%3F,or%20collide%20with%20each%20other"><strong>gravitational waves</strong></a>, a significant achievement made possible in part by Feynman’s influential contribution.</p>

<p><strong>Hvaldimir</strong>, the <strong>beluga whale</strong> spotted off the Swedish coast, gained attention due to the harness attached to its head, leading to speculations of it being a Russian spy.</p>
<p><strong>Examples of animals being used for espionage:</strong> During World War I, <strong>pigeons</strong> were equipped with cameras and used to capture images over enemy territory;  Dolphins and sea lions, have been trained for military purposes, such as detecting submarines and retrieving materials; the CIA even attempted to <strong>use cats as listening devices</strong> in the <strong>Acoustic Kitty project</strong>, although with limited success.</p>
<p><strong>Ethical issues concerned:</strong> Animal cruelty, lack of respect for animal rights, and the potential for unintended consequences and harm to innocent animals.</p>
<p><strong>Usage</strong>: Such examples can be quoted in International Ethics / War ethics-related questions / Essays.</p>
<p><strong>About Beluga whale</strong></p>
<p>The beluga whale is an <strong>Arctic and sub-Arctic cetacean</strong>. It is 6 m long, related to <strong>dolphins</strong>, and known for its chirps, clicks, whistles, and squeals. Distribution: Arctic and subarctic coastal waters; It sheds its skin every year, turning from grey to white as it ages. IUCN Red List Status: <strong>Near Threatened</strong></p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The recent ruling by the Supreme Court states that when the government enters into a contract under the President’s name, it <strong>cannot claim immunity from the legal provisions of that contract under Article 299 of the Constitution.</strong></p>
<p><strong>About the case:</strong> </p>
<p>The case involved <strong>Glock Asia-Pacific Limited, a pistol manufacturing company</strong>, and the Centre (government). Glock had a <strong>contract with the Ministry of Home Affairs</strong> to supply pistols, but a dispute arose when the government invoked a <strong>performance bank guarantee</strong>. <strong>Glock invoked arbitration</strong>, but the government challenged the appointment of the arbitrator based on a tender condition.</p>
<p>The Supreme <strong>Court decided in favour of Glock</strong>, stating that the arbitration clause allowing a government officer as an arbitrator conflicted with the law. The court appointed a retired Supreme Court judge as the arbitrator to resolve the dispute.</p>
<p><strong>Article 299 of the Constitution:</strong></p>
<p>Article 299 specifies the <strong>manner in which government contracts</strong> should be concluded and executed. The objective of this article is to <strong>ensure that contracts made by agents acting on the government’s behalf adhere</strong> to a defined procedure to prevent unauthorized or illegitimate contracts that may <strong>deplete public funds</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: Recently, the <strong>Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor</strong> raised red flags over <strong>banks adopting innovative methods for evergreening of loans</strong> – covering up the real status of stressed loans of corporates.</p>
<p><strong>About Evergreening of loans:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Evergreening of loans refers to a <strong>practice where banks or lenders provide additional funds or take other measures to artificially sustain a loan</strong> that is not being repaid as scheduled.</li>
<li>It is a <strong>temporary solution used by banks to avoid classifying the loan as</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/10/12/why-npas-are-not-just-about-bank-governance/#:~:text=What%20are%20NPAs%3A%20A%20non,a%20period%20of%2090%20days.">a non-performing asset (NPA)</a> because such classification would <strong>require them to set aside more money for potential losses, which could affect their profitability.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Methods used by banks for Evergreening of loans:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bringing <strong>two lenders together to evergreen each other’s loans</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Good borrowers are being persuaded to enter into structured deals with stressed borrowers</strong>.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has conceptualised a <strong>lightweight payment and settlements system</strong>, which can be <strong>operated from anywhere by a bare minimum staff</strong> in exigencies such as <strong>natural calamities or war.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The infrastructure for this system will be <strong>independent of the technologies that underlie the existing systems of payments such as UPI, NEFT, and RTGS.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Difference between</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/05/the-unified-payments-interface-upi/">UPI</a> <strong>and lightweight system:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The key difference lies in the <strong>resilience and availability of the two systems.</strong></li>
<li>UPI and other conventional systems prioritize <strong>handling large transaction volumes and require a stable and robust infrastructure</strong>.</li>
<li>On the other hand, the lightweight system is designed <strong>to operate even in volatile and extreme conditions when regular payment systems may not be accessible.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Such a system could ensure near-<strong>zero downtime of the payment and settlement system</strong> in the country and <strong>keep the liquidity pipeline of the economy alive</strong> and intact by facilitating the uninterrupted functioning of essential payments.</li>
<li>By implementing a lightweight system as a backup, the RBI aims to ensure that individuals and institutions can <strong>continue to make payments during emergencies or disruptions to the conventional payment infrastructure</strong>.</li>
<li>It serves as a <strong>precautionary measure to be prepared for extreme situations and maintain the continuity of financial transactions.</strong></li>
