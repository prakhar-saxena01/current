<h4 id="gs1gs2gs4"><strong>GS1/GS2/GS4</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus: Indian Society/ Social Justice/Ethics</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-65682796"><strong>BBC</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> A recent study has revealed that as prosperity and opportunities for men in India have improved, the demand for dowry has increased.</p>
<ul>
<li>The researchers examined <strong>more than 74,000 marriages in India</strong> between <strong>1930 and 1999</strong> to examine the evolution of dowry over time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key findings of the study about Dowry in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Economic growth perpetuates and boosts the practice of dowry payments</strong> in India</li>
<li><strong>As men gain better education and higher-quality jobs</strong>, dowry amounts increase.</li>
<li><strong>Dowry payments decrease</strong> as more women receive education in an area.</li>
<li><strong>Promoting women’s education and increasing their participation in the workforce</strong> can potentially help reduce the prevalence of dowry.</li>
<li><strong>Families refusing to pay dowry may end up</strong> with <strong>lower-quality grooms</strong> for their daughters, creating a strong economic incentive for grooms to accept dowry.</li>
<li><strong>No correlation with caste-based factors:</strong> The practice of dowry began around the same time for both high and low-caste groups, indicating that caste-based factors do not solely explain its rise.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Status of Marriages in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Most Indian marriages are still arranged</strong>, and nearly all women marry by their late twenties.</li>
<li><strong>Some 90% of the marriages</strong> studied until 1999 involved dowry</li>
<li><strong>Nearly all marriages</strong> in India are <strong>monogamous</strong></li>
<li><strong>Less than 1%</strong> end in divorce</li>
<li><strong>Parents play an important</strong> role in choosing the bride/groom</li>
<li><strong>Over 90% of couples live</strong> with the husband’s family after marriage</li>
<li><strong>More than 85% of women marry</strong> someone from outside their own village</li>
<li><strong>Over 78% of marriages</strong> are within the same district</li>
</ul>
<p>(Source: India Human Development Survey, 2005; National Family Health Survey 2006; REDS, 1999)</p>
<p><strong>What is the Dowry system in India?</strong> </p>
<p>The dowry system in India refers to the <strong>bride’s family giving to the bridegroom</strong>, his parents, or his relatives as a condition of the marriage.</p>

<p><strong>Consequences of the prevalence of the dowry system in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Financial Burden</strong> on the Bride’s Family</li>
<li><strong>Abuse</strong>: Women are subjected to physical, emotional, and mental abuse if dowry demands are not met.</li>
<li><strong>Norms</strong>: Reinforcement of patriarchal norms, treating women as inferior and perpetuating gender-based discrimination.</li>
<li><strong>Breakdown of Marriages</strong>: Dowry-related disputes and conflicts often lead to marital discord, separation, and even divorce.</li>
<li><strong>Deaths</strong>: Cases of dowry deaths, suicides, and bride burning due to dowry disputes and harassment.</li>
<li><strong>Financial dependence:</strong> Women’s lack of financial independence and control over their own resources, leads to dependency on their husbands.</li>
<li><strong>Inequality</strong>: Preference for investing in dowry over girls’ education, limiting their opportunities for personal and professional growth.</li>
<li><strong>Reinforcement of Harmful Stereotypes</strong>: Dowry perpetuates the notion that women are commodities to be bought, reinforcing harmful stereotypes in society.</li>

<p><strong>Ethical aspects of dowry in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Violation of human rights, gender inequality, and commodification</strong> of women.</li>
<li>Dowry is considered <strong>unethical as it treats women as commodities</strong>, subjecting them to financial transactions and devaluing their worth.</li>
<li><strong>Dowry perpetuates gender discrimination</strong>, where women are seen as burdens and objects of transaction.</li>
<li>Dowry infringes <strong>upon the principles of equality, dignity, and autonomy</strong>.</li>
<li>The practice goes against the fundamental values of <strong>respect, fairness, and justic</strong></li>
<li>Ethically, dowry is condemned as <strong>it promotes inequality, perpetuates harmful stereotypes</strong>, and undermines the inherent rights and dignity of women.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Educating daughters is a valuable gift that empowers them. Society needs to be aware of the seriousness of crimes related to dowry. Local communities should be engaged through women’s rights education programs. Misuse of dowry provisions should be addressed through laws and safeguards.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In the 75th year of Independence, India’s new Parliament building, embodying the culture, pride and spirit of the entire nation, was recently inaugurated by the PM of India.</li>
<li>19 opposition parties boycotted the inauguration event, accusing the central government of sidelining President Droupadi Murmu – the country’s first tribal head of state.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/parliment.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/parliment.png" /></a></p>
<p><strong>The old Parliament:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>At the coronation of George V as Emperor of India in <strong>1911</strong>, the announcement of the transfer of the seat of GoI <strong>from Calcutta to the ancient Capital of Delhi</strong> was made.</li>
<li><strong>The GoI Act 1919</strong> provided for a bicameral legislature for India and the need for the new was felt.</li>
<li>The parliament building’s construction took six years (and Rs 83 lakhs) – from 1921 to 1927, and its <strong>circular shape</strong> is believed to be inspired by the <strong>Chausath Yogini temple</strong> at Mitawli village in MP’s Morena district.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Need for a new Parliament building:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Existing Parliament is old:</strong> The existing Parliament house (which will be converted into a ‘Museum of Democracy’ after the new Parliament becomes operational) is almost a century-old <strong>Heritage Grade-I building,</strong> showing signs of distress and over-utilization.</li>
<li><strong>Narrow seating space for MPs:</strong><ul>
<li>The present building was never designed to accommodate a bicameral legislature for a full-fledged democracy.</li>
<li><strong>The Central Hall</strong> has seating capacity only for 440 persons and <strong>when the Joint Sessions are held</strong>, the problem of limited seats amplifies.</li>
<li><strong>The number of Lok Sabha seats is likely to increase</strong> significantly from the current 545 after 2026.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Distressed infrastructure:</strong> The addition of services like water supply, sewer lines, etc., has led to seepage of water at several places and impacted the aesthetics of the building.</li>
<li><strong>Safety concerns:</strong> For example, fire safety, structural safety (Delhi is currently in Seismic Zone-IV), etc.</li>
<li><strong>Obsolete communication structures:</strong> Communications infrastructure and technology is antiquated in the existing Parliament, and the acoustics of all the halls need improvement.</li>
<li><strong>Inadequate workspace for employees.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The new Parliament:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is part of the <strong>Central Vista Project</strong> – the ongoing redevelopment project <strong>to revamp</strong> India’s central administrative area (designed by <strong>Sir Edwin Lutyens and Sir Herbert Baker</strong> during British colonial rule) located near Raisina Hill, New Delhi.</li>
<li>It is <strong>designed</strong> by Ahmedabad-based HCP Design, Planning and Management under architect <strong>Bimal Patel</strong> and has been built by <strong>Tata Projects Ltd.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/new_parliament.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/new_parliament.png" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Main features of the new Parliament building:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A “<strong>Platinum-rated Green Building</strong>” with about 65,000 sq m built-up area, which will be <strong>divyang friendly.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The triangular shape</strong> ensures the optimum utilisation of space.</li>
<li><strong>A larger Lok Sabha hall</strong> (888 seats) based on the <strong>peacock theme</strong> (India’s national bird) and a larger Rajya Sabha hall (384 seats) based on the <strong>lotus theme</strong> (India’s national flower).</li>
<li>The Lok Sabha <strong>may accommodate up to 1,272 seats for joint sessions of Parliament.</strong></li>
<li>A state-of-the-art <strong>Constitutional Hall</strong> symbolically and physically puts the Indian citizens at the heart of our democracy.</li>
<li><strong>A Central Lounge</strong> that will complement the open courtyard (with a banyan – the national tree) will be a place for members to interact with each other.</li>
<li><strong>Ultra-modern state-of-the-art</strong> <strong>features</strong> like a digitised voting system, well-engineered acoustics and audiovisual systems in the two chambers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interior decorations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Murals</strong> depicting maps of ancient India-protected monuments of ASI and UNESCO, etc.</li>
<li>3 ceremonial entrance halls with huge <strong>brass images of Mahatma Gandhi</strong>, Chanakya, Gargi, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, B.R. Ambedkar, and the <strong>Chariot Wheel from the Sun Temple at Konark</strong> are on display.</li>
<li>Reflecting the <strong>cultural diversity of India</strong> in line with the “Made in India” initiative <strong>Tripura’s epitome bamboo wood flooring</strong> and carpets from UP’s Mirzapur embellished the new Parliament.</li>

<p><strong>Significance of the new Parliament:</strong> Symbol of the vision and aspirations of India, the spirit of change and continuity and will witness the making of India as ‘<strong>Aatmanirbhar Bharat</strong>’.</p>
<p><strong>Expectations from the new Parliament:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The trend of <strong>increasing disruptions and long periods of deadlock</strong> is antithetical to the spirit of Parliament – law-making through debate, discussion, and consensus.</li>
<li>Hence, the new Parliament offers <strong>an opportunity to seriously introspect on Parliamentary conduct</strong> and make Parliament <strong>more efficient and productive.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The new Parliament should not only be the fountainhead/epitome of architectural excellence but should also work as a lighthouse to guide India in its ambitious journey of ‘new India@100’; ‘Ek Bharat, Shrestha Bharat’, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>:  ISRO will launch a <strong>new NavIC satellite ( NVS-01</strong>), belonging to the second generation of the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS), known as NavIC, to overcome some of the previous issues faced by NavIC.</p>
<p><strong>Issues faced by NavIC (Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Atomic clock failure:</strong> Several of the existing satellites stopped providing location data after their onboard atomic clocks failed</li>
<li><strong>Satellite Replacement</strong>: Some of the satellites in the NAVIC constellation have reached the <strong>end of their mission life</strong> or become partially defunct.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Coverage:</strong> While NAVIC provides coverage over the Indian landmass and a radius of 1,500 km around it, there is a need for further expansion and ground stations outside India to improve coverage and accuracy in hard-to-reach areas.</li>
<li><strong>User Segment Development</strong>: There has been a delay in the development of user receivers for the NAVIC system, resulting in limited utilization of the navigation services.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile Compatibility</strong>: Mobile phones in India currently lack compatibility to process NAVIC signals, limiting the widespread use of the system.</li>
<li><strong>Security and Encryption</strong>: Ensuring the security of NAVIC signals and preventing breaches or spoofing is a significant challenge.</li>

<li><strong>L1 Frequency:</strong> The inclusion of the L1 frequency (besides L5 and S frequency) <strong>enhances compatibility</strong> with wearable devices and personal trackers. The inclusion of L1 frequency also increases interoperability with other satellite-based navigation systems.</li>
<li><strong>Longer mission life</strong>: The second-generation satellites will also have a longer mission life of <strong>more than 12 years</strong>. The existing satellites have a mission life of 10 years.</li>
<li><strong>Rubidium atomic clock:</strong> The atomic clock ensures accurate positioning, addressing a previous issue faced by satellites in the constellation</li>
<li><strong>The heaviest in the constellation of NAVIC satellites</strong> ( will be launched by a Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) rocket): Previous satellites were much lighter and launched on PSLV. The higher weight allowance allows for more instruments and fuel to be loaded.</li>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Currently, NavIC’s reach extends only 1,500 km beyond Indian territory. However, for applications involving ships and aeroplanes travelling beyond this range, satellites in Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) would be required. By adding MEO satellites in the future, NavIC can extend its <strong>global reach and aim to provide navigation services</strong> on a global scale, similar to the capabilities of the GPS system.</p>

<p><strong>The Odisha government</strong> has decided <strong>to shift from direct bank transfers to cash payments</strong> at the Panchayat level for its <strong>Madhu Babu Pension Yojana (MBPY)</strong> due to challenges faced by pensioners in accessing their funds and technical issues with the MBPY portal.</p>
<p>The move has been criticized by Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, who believes it is a step backwards in the <strong>fight against corruption</strong>. Odisha has <strong>poor banking infrastructure</strong> in rural areas, making it <strong>difficult for pensioners</strong> to withdraw their funds.</p>
<p><strong>Usage</strong>: The example can be used to highlight the difficulties in the use of direct cash transfers for social security payments in India.</p>

<p><strong>The limitations and potential drawbacks of using “giant artificial intelligence” (gAIs) like ChatGPT, Bard, Chinchilla, PaLM, LaMDA, et al</strong>.<strong>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of democratic input:</strong> gAIs are designed <strong>from the top down</strong>, limiting the involvement and input of the people who are meant to use them.</li>
<li><strong>Reduction in diversity:</strong> gAIs tend to <strong>abstract away local knowledge</strong> and diverse perspectives, favouring a more standardized and globalized view of information.</li>
<li><strong>Language and cultural biases:</strong> Models trained primarily on internet data, which is largely in English, can perpetuate biases and overlook the nuances of other languages and cultures.</li>
<li><strong>Incomplete understanding</strong>: gAIs may provide intelligible responses but can fail to fully grasp the context and intricacies of certain questions, leading to incomplete or inaccurate answers.</li>
<li><strong>Stochastic behaviour</strong>: gAIs can exhibit <strong>randomness in their responses,</strong> making their behaviour unpredictable and potentially unreliable.</li>
<li><strong>Potential risks of artificial general intelligence (AGI):</strong> Researchers warn that advancements in AGI, a field of study related to gAIs, could pose significant risks, including catastrophic consequences.</li>
<li><strong>Reduction in human involvement:</strong> The reliance on gAIs for knowledge work may lead to a decreased role for human expertise and decision-making, potentially eroding important skills and experiences.</li>
<li><strong>Ethical concerns:</strong> The deployment and use of gAIs raise ethical considerations, including privacy, transparency, and accountability in decision-making processes.</li>
