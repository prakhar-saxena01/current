<h4 id="gs-paper-2"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Role of Civil Services in a Democracy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/civil-services-conduct-8628406/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Specially designed Conduct Rules govern a civil servant’s behaviour and conduct.</p>
<p><strong>What are the civil services?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>There are 3 All India Services</strong> (governed by <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/governance/role-of-civil-service-in-a-democracy/framework-of-civil-service-structure-in-india/"><strong>Article 312</strong></a> of the Indian Constitution) – the IAS, IPS and the Indian Forest Service (IFoS) – with officers allotted to various state cadres by the central government.<ul>
<li>The Centre then gets a certain percentage of officers from each state on <strong>central deputation.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Other services</strong> are called Central Civil Services (such as the Indian Foreign Service, the Indian Revenue Service, Customs and Central Excise Service, etc).<ul>
<li>These are <strong>under the central government with no state cadre system</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rules governing civil services:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There are two sets of rules for civil servants – one for AISs (The AIS Conduct Rules, <strong>1968</strong>) and the other for CCSs (The CCS Conduct Rules, <strong>1964</strong>).</li>
<li>These were framed based on recommendations from a committee – <strong>Committee on Prevention of Corruption headed by K Santhanam</strong> – constituted in 1962.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Code of conduct highlighted in the rules:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Every member of the Service shall –<ul>
<li><strong>Maintain high ethical standards</strong>, integrity and honesty; political neutrality; accountability and transparency; fairness and impartiality; responsiveness to the public, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Use public resources efficiently,</strong> effectively and economically; declare any private interests relating to his public duties to resolve any conflict of interest.</li>
<li><strong>At all times maintain devotion to duty</strong>, and do nothing which is unbecoming of a member of the Service.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No member of the Service shall –<ul>
<li><strong>Use his/her position to secure employment</strong> for any of his/her family members with any private undertaking/NGO;</li>
<li>Give or take or abet the giving or taking of</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>A member of the service may accept gifts</strong> from his near relatives or friends having no official dealings with them.<ul>
<li>But, he shall report to the government <strong>if the value of such gift exceeds Rs.25,000.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>While members can hold personal political beliefs, these rules restrict the degree to which they can act on them. <strong>For example,</strong> members not allowed –<ul>
<li>To be part of, assist political parties; interfere with or take part in an election to any legislature or local authority.</li>
<li>To criticise any current policy or action of the government. However, civil servants are allowed to express their opinion on official documents.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Penalties for transgressions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Major penalties can include “<strong>dismissal</strong>” from the service as well.</li>
<li>Besides, there are also the penal provisions mentioned under the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2018/11/27/prevention-of-corruption-act/"><strong>Prevention of Corruption Act (POCA).</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Issues with the Conduct Rules:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vague:</strong> For example, while the promotion of casteism is not covered under any specific Conduct Rules, casteist behaviour can be interpreted as “unbecoming of a member of the Service”.</li>
<li><strong>Ambiguous:</strong> Ideas like personal integrity are not well defined. That is why evils like taking dowry are banned but seemingly common.</li>
<li><strong>There is no ethical code for civil servants in India.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Syllabus</strong><strong>: Inter-State water dispute</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/explained-the-telangana-andhra-pradesh-water-dispute/article66880971.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/functions-and-responsibilities-of-the-union-and-the-states-issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure-devolution-of-powers-and-finances-up-to-local-levels-and-challenges-therein/issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure/inter-state-relations/inter-state-water-disputes/">water dispute</a> between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, stemming from the <strong>Krishna River,</strong> remains unresolved even after <strong>nine years since the bifurcation</strong> of the combined state.</p>
<p><strong>About the Dispute:</strong></p>
<p>The dispute began with the <strong>erstwhile Hyderabad and Mysore states</strong> and later continued between successors Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. It originated from the <strong>Gentlemen’s Agreement signed in 1956</strong>, which aimed to protect the <strong>Telangana region’s interests regarding water resources</strong>. In 1969, the <strong>Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal (KWDT)</strong> was set up under the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/04/18/inter-state-river-water-disputes-act-1956-2/#:~:text=Art%20262%20provides%20for%20the,state%20river%20and%20river%20valley."><strong>Inter-State River Water Dispute Act, of 1956</strong></a>, and presented its report in 1973. It divided water between <strong>Karnataka, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh.</strong></p>
<p>After the bifurcation of the state, both states have proposed new projects (e.g., the project to increase <strong>Krishna water utilization above the Srisailam Reservoir)</strong> without proper clearance from <strong>river boards and authorities</strong> as required by the <strong>Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014</strong>. This led to <strong>complaints and disputes</strong> between the two states. Also, Telangana has been <strong>pushing for an equal share</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Legal Provisions:<br />
</strong></p>
<p>The Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 mandates for the <strong>constitution of an Apex Council by the Central Government</strong> for the supervision of the functioning of the <strong>Godavari River Management Board and Krishna River Management Board</strong>. The Apex Council comprises the <strong>Union Water Resources Minister and the Chief Ministers of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Constitutional provisions:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Inter-State River Water Disputes</strong>: Under Article 262, Parliament may by law provide for the <strong>adjudication of any dispute or complaint</strong> with respect to the use, distribution and control of waters of any inter-state river and river valley. The Parliament enacted two laws, <strong>the River Boards Act (1956) and the Inter-State Water Disputes Act (1956).</strong></p>
<p><strong>About River board:</strong></p>
<p>The River Boards Act provides for the establishment of <strong>river boards by the Central government for the regulation</strong> and development of inter-state rivers and river valleys. <strong>A River Board is established</strong> at the request of state governments concerned to advise them.</p>
<p><strong>About Inter-State Water Disputes Act:</strong></p>
<p><strong>It</strong> empowers the Central government to set up an <strong>ad hoc tribunal for the adjudication of a dispute</strong> between two or more states in relation to the waters of an inter-state river or river valley. The decision of the tribunal <strong>is final and binding on the parties</strong> to the dispute. <strong>Neither the Supreme Court nor any other court is to have jurisdiction</strong> in respect of any water dispute which may be referred to such a tribunal under this Act.</p>
<p><strong>Way forward:</strong></p>
<p>To address water disputes effectively, it is <strong>necessary to establish a permanent tribunal</strong> with <strong>Supreme Court’s appellate jurisdiction</strong> and <strong>amend Article 262</strong> and the Inter-State Water Disputes Act. Communication channels must be improved for <strong>consensus-building</strong>, and the central body should represent states adequately. The Ministry of Jal Shakti has issued a gazette notification <strong>defining the jurisdiction of river management boards</strong>, which can help overcome challenges. <strong>Clear demarcation of power</strong> for each state should be followed.</p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-3"><strong>GS Paper 3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Conservation, Environmental Pollution and Degradation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The World Meteorological Congress, the supreme body of the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/03/26/world-meteorological-organisation-wmo/">World Meteorological Organization (WMO)</a>, is currently holding its 19th session (Cg-19).</p>
<p><strong>The outcome of the Congress:</strong> It recognised climate change as a threat to human health and endorsed a 10-year plan – <em>The 2023-2033 Implementation Plan for Advancing Climate, Environment and Health Science and Services by the WHO-WMO</em>, to scale up health services.</p>
<p><strong>About the plan:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Aim: To achieve better health and well-being</strong> for people facing existing and emerging extreme weather events, climate change and environmental risks.</p>
<p><strong>How?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Through the <strong>effective integration</strong> of climate, environment and health science and services across the world.</li>
<li><strong>It will promote a coordinated approach</strong> to managing the impact of climate, weather, air pollution, ultraviolet radiation, extreme events, etc., on health.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance:</strong> It is significant when</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Climate-related illnesses</strong> (like malaria and dengue), premature deaths, malnutrition and threats to mental health and well-being are increasing.</li>
<li>Climate-related cascading risks of <strong>extreme heat (</strong>15,000 people died in Europe in 2022<strong>), wildfire and air quality</strong>-related health risks are increasing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance for India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In 2022, India recorded its hottest March</strong> which triggered an <strong>early onslaught of heat waves</strong> across north, central and east India from March-May.</li>
<li><strong>Extreme heat will oust 600 million Indians</strong> from their climate niche, exposing them to extreme temperatures by 2030.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Indian scientists (from the Indian Institute of Astrophysics) have created a <strong>computer model of cosmic dust particles</strong> that can imitate the <strong>unique way interstellar comet 2I/Borisov scatters light</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Use</strong>: By studying the <strong>way light scatters off these</strong> cosmic particles, they can better understand <strong>how comets behave</strong>. The model accurately <strong>reproduced the scattering of light</strong> seen in experiments and observations. It revealed the presence of a large number of porous cosmic dust particles.</p>

<tr>
<td><strong>Composition</strong></td>
<td>Amorphous silicate (Forsterite) and amorphous carbon</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Found in</strong></td>
<td>Cosmic dust particles can be found in <strong>different environments</strong>, such as interstellar space, planetary systems, and the atmospheres of planets and moons.</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Role played</strong></td>
<td>They contribute to the <strong>formation of stars and planetary systems</strong> by providing material for <strong>accretion</strong>. They also <strong>scatter and absorb light</strong>, affecting the radiation properties of <strong>celestial objects</strong>. Additionally, these particles serve as <strong>building blocks for the formation of larger objects</strong>, such as asteroids, comets, and planets.</td>
