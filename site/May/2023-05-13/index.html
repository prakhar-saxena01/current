<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Supreme Court of India has passed a <strong>unanimous verdict on various issues</strong> related to the split in Shiv Sena in June 2022.</p>
<p><strong>Background of the issue:</strong></p>
<p>In 2019, <strong>Uddhav Thackeray became the Chief Minister</strong> of Maharashtra leading the <strong>MVA alliance</strong>. In 2022, <strong>Eknath Shinde and other MLAs</strong> went missing, claiming no confidence in the MVA alliance and Thackeray. The Thackeray group initiated <strong>disqualification proceedings</strong> against them, and Mr Shinde moved the Supreme Court to dispute it. The Governor directed a floor test to see if <strong>Thackeray’s government</strong> still had support, and <strong>Uddhav Thackeray resigned</strong> without facing it. Later, the <strong>Election Commission of India</strong> allotted the <strong>name Shiv Sena and party symbol to Shinde’s faction</strong>, and Thackeray’s side argued that they must be <strong>disqualified as their actions</strong> amounted to defection.</p>

<tr>
<td><strong>Observation</strong></td>
<td><strong>Explanation</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Appointment of whip</strong></td>
<td>Speaker must recognise the <strong>whip and leader authorised by the political party</strong>, based on the party constitution, after conducting an inquiry.<br><br>The <strong>power to appoint a whip and a leader rests with the “political party”</strong> and <strong>not the “legislature party,”</strong> as stated in the <strong>Tenth Schedule of the Constitution.</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Legislative wing vs political party</strong></td>
<td><strong>Allowing the legislative wing to act independently</strong> from the political party <strong>contradicts</strong> the constitutional system of governance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Disqualification procedure</strong></td>
<td>Disqualification ought to be <strong>decided as per established procedures in law</strong> and the <strong>Speaker is the appropriate authority for this under the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution</strong>, which lays down the anti-defection law.<br><br>While deciding disqualification pleas, the Speaker must consider the <strong>constitution of the political party</strong> (as submitted to ECI)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Pending disqualification petitions</strong></td>
<td>The <strong>Speaker should decide on pending disqualification petitions in a reasonable timeframe.</strong><br><br><strong>MLAs have the right to participate in proceedings of the House</strong> regardless of the pendency of any petitions for disqualification.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Floor test</strong></td>
<td>A floor test is to be c<strong>onducted by the Governor only on obtaining objective material</strong> to show that the incumbent government had lost the confidence of the House.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Governor’s role</strong></td>
<td>Then <strong>Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari was not justified in calling for a floor test</strong> on June 30, 2022, as he did not have objective material to show that the incumbent government had lost the confidence of the House.<br><br>The Governor is <strong>not empowered to enter the political arena</strong> and play a role in <strong>inter or intra-party disputes</strong>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Restoration of the Uddhav government</strong></td>
<td>The Thackeray group had sought to restore the <strong>situation prior to June 29, 2022</strong>, but the Supreme Court ruled that it cannot reinstate the Uddhav government as <strong>he had resigned and not faced the floor test.</strong></td>

<p><strong>Significance of the judgement:</strong> It upholds the <strong>principles of constitutional morality</strong> and the integrity of the democratic process.</p>
<p><strong>Terms Used:</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Political party” Vs “Legislature party”:</strong></p>
<p><strong>W</strong>hile a political party is an organization of people with common political goals and ideologies, e.g., BJP, Congress; a <strong>legislature party</strong> is a group of <strong>elected representatives of the same political party</strong> who coordinate their legislative activities and strategy in the legislature. E.g., elected representatives of BJP in Lok Sabha forms the “legislature party” of BJP in Lok Sabha.</p>
<p><strong>What is a Whip?</strong></p>
<p>A whip is a <strong>party official in charge of ensuring that party members</strong> vote in accordance with the <strong>party’s position</strong> on a particular issue. The concept originated from <strong>British Parliament.</strong> All parties can <strong>issue whips to their members</strong>. Parties appoint a <strong>senior member from among their House contingents</strong> to issue whips — this member is called a <strong>chief whip</strong>, and he/ she is assisted by additional whips</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Supreme Court of India has given the state government of Delhi complete control over administrative services in the National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCTD), <strong>except for public order, police, and land</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Background of the Issue:</strong> </p>
<p>The Delhi government and Lieutenant Governor have been in a legal battle since 2015 over <strong>control of “services” in Delhi</strong>. The Supreme Court gave a split verdict in 2019, and a five-judge Constitution Bench has now delivered its verdict on the issue of control and whether <strong>officers allocated to Delhi come under the administrative control</strong> of the Delhi government or Delhi LG. The case also included the <strong>constitutional validity of the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Act 2021,</strong> which referred to the <strong>Lieutenant Governor as the “government”</strong> in any law made by the Legislative Assembly of Delhi.</p>

<p><strong>About Article 239 AA</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Constitution (69th Amendment) Act, 1991 inserted Article 239 AA</strong> in the Constitution, giving special status to Delhi and establishing an <strong>Administrator and a Legislative Assembly.</strong> The Assembly has the <strong>power to make laws for the NCT of Delhi</strong>, except for <strong>police, public order, and land</strong>. The L-G has <strong>dual control</strong> and can either act on the <strong>aid and advice of the Council of Ministers</strong> or refer a difference of opinion to the President. This power tussle between the elected government and the L-G has been a point of contention.</p>
<p><strong>How UTs are administered?</strong></p>
<p>The Union Territories (UTs) in India are administered <strong>by the President</strong> through an appointed <strong>administrator</strong>, who represents the President and exercises administrative powers in the UT. The judiciary in the UTs is governed by the Constitution and laws made by the Parliament. In some UTs, such as <strong>Delhi and Puducherry</strong>, the administrator holds <strong>significant powers,</strong> including the ability to make laws and regulations for the UT, while in others, the administrator’s powers are limited to providing advice to the elected government.</p>
<p><strong>Special provision for Delhi UT:</strong></p>
<p>Special provisions have been made for certain UTs, such as <strong>Puducherry, Delhi, and Jammu and Kashmir (yet to be constituted),</strong> which have a legislative assembly and a <strong>Council of Ministers headed by a Chief Minister</strong>. The legislative assembly of these UTs has the power to make laws with respect to matters enumerated in List II or List III in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution insofar as these matters are applicable in relation to the UT.</p>
<p>However, <strong>some entries in List II, such as public order, police, and land,</strong> are not within the legislative competence of the legislative assembly of Delhi.</p>
<p><strong>Quotes used by SC:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Quote 1:</strong> “The principles of democracy and federalism are essential features of our Constitution and form a part of the basic structure.</p>
<p><strong>Quote 2:</strong> “Federalism is a means to reconcile the desire of commonality along with the desire for autonomy and accommodate diverse needs in a pluralistic society”</p>

<p>According to a <strong>recent study by the University of California, Riverside, ChatGPT</strong> requires half a litre of water to answer <strong>every 20-50 questions</strong>, making the total water footprint of AI extremely large.</p>
<p><strong>Water use in AI:</strong> Water used in <strong>maintaining AI tools</strong> are primarily used for cooling data centres to prevent equipment failure. Also, the water used in this process must be <strong>pure freshwater to prevent corrosion</strong> and the formation of microorganisms.</p>
<p><strong>Usage:</strong> The example can be used to show the water footprint of emerging technologies.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The <strong>US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)</strong> has ended the longstanding restrictions on gay and bisexual men from donating blood.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p>The prohibition was <strong>first implemented during the HIV/AIDS crisis</strong> in the 1980s and has been long decried as <strong>discriminatory</strong> by the LGBTQI+ community and its supporters.</p>
<p><strong>New guidelines:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Donors have to answer a questionnaire and they will be screened <strong>based on their recent sexual activity rather than their sexual orientation or sex.</strong></li>
<li>Have done away with the <strong>three-month deferral period for monogamous</strong> MSM, but it stays in place for those who have had new or multiple partners in the past three months.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong>: The new changes have been introduced to boost blood donations across the US and address the discriminatory nature of the existing policy.</p>
<p><strong>India:</strong> Transgenders, gay people, and female sex workers aren’t allowed to donate blood. This is according to <strong>clauses 12 and 51 of the ‘Guidelines for Blood Donor Selection &amp; Blood Donor Referral, 2017’</strong> issued by the <strong>National Blood Transfusion Council (NBTC)</strong> and the <strong>National Aids Control Organisation</strong> on October 11, 2017.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for ban</strong>: Government argues that there is substantial evidence to show that LGBTQ is at risk for HIV, Hepatitis B or C infections.</p>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/business/rbi-asks-banks-to-complete-transition-away-from-libor-from-july-1/article66843545.ece"><strong>The Hindu</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The <strong>Reserve Bank of India (RBI)</strong> has issued an <strong>advisory to banks and other RBI-regulated entities</strong> asking them to take steps to ensure a <strong>complete transition away from the London Interbank</strong></p>
<p><strong>Offered Rate (LIBOR) from July 1.</strong> </p>

<td><strong>Explanation</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>What is LIBOR?</strong></td>
<td>It is a <strong>benchmark interest rate</strong> at which <strong>major global banks lend to one another</strong> in the <strong>international interbank market for short-term loans</strong>.<br><br>It serves <strong>short-term loans with maturities from Overnight to 1 year</strong>.<br><br>It also acts as a basis for Corporate and Government Bonds, mortgages, student loans, credit cards, derivatives, and other Financial Products.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>How does LIBOR work?</strong></td>
<td>Administered by <strong>ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA),</strong> regulated by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).<br><br>It is based on five currencies, <strong>including the U.S. dollar, the euro, the British pound, the Japanese yen, and the Swiss franc, and serves 7 different maturity periods.</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Why is LIBOR being brought to an end?</strong></td>
<td>LIBOR’s credibility was damaged by <strong>rate-fixing scandals in 2012</strong>.<br><br>The panel banks’ <strong>submissions were alleged to be inaccurate or manipulated to project market strength</strong>.<br><br>After the 2012 Wheatley Review, a number of reforms were introduced to reduce subjective input and make LIBOR a transaction-based benchmark.<br><br>However, despite the reforms introduced, the number of transactions in the short-term wholesale Funding Market reduced over time. Thus, <strong>LIBOR became more vulnerable to short-term market illiquidity and amplification of price moves that could cause systemic risks.</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>What are the alternative reference rates?</strong></td>
<td><strong>Secured overnight financing rate (SOFR</strong>) is being widely used as a substitute for LIBOR across the world.<br><br>Other Benchmarks rates <strong>– (1) CHF – SARON; (2) EUR – ESTER; (3) GBP – SONIA (Already in use since March 31, 2021); (4) JPY – TONA</strong>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>What are the limitations of SOFR?</strong></td>
<td>Based upon the <strong>repurchase (repo) markets</strong>, it is at the repo markets’ mercy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>What are the other challenges of shifting from LIBOR?</strong></td>
<td>There could be a lot of volatility in the financial markets as the deadline arrives. The RBI has issued <strong>two circulars giving the roadmap to the transition and arrangements to be made for the same.</strong></td>

<p>The study found that <strong>warm waters will increase both the growth rates and death rates of fish</strong>, resulting in a <strong>younger but larger fish population</strong>.
