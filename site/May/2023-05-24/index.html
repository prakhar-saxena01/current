<p><strong>Context:</strong> To overturn a unanimous decision of the SC’s Constitution Bench [which gave the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/13/delhi-government-case-vs-lg/">Delhi govt control over services in the NCT</a>], the central government has issued an <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/04/23/insights-into-editorial-the-ordinance-route-is-bad-repromulgation-worse/">Ordinance</a>.</p>
<p><strong>About the Ordinance:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It gave the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi <strong>power over services.</strong></li>
<li>It established a <strong>National Capital Civil Service Authority.</strong><ul>
<li>The authority will comprise the CM and two senior IAS officials.</li>
<li>It would decide matters by majority votes – which <strong>may lead to a situation in which the view of the elected CM could be overruled.</strong></li>

<tr>
<td><strong>Meaning</strong></td>
<td>It is a law enacted by the Executive (President in the case of Union and Governor in the case of State) <strong>to meet extraordinary/urgent circumstances.</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Extraordinary/urgent circumstances</strong></td>
<td><strong>Article 123</strong> of the Indian Constitution empowers the <strong>President</strong> [Article 213 – Governor] to promulgate Ordinances <strong>during recess of Parliament.</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Article 123</strong></td>
<td>If at any time, except when both Houses of Parliament are in session, the President is satisfied that <strong>circumstances exist which render it necessary</strong> for him to take immediate action, he may promulgate Ordinances.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Real authority that decides to bring the Ordinance</strong></td>
<td>Under <strong>Article 74</strong>, the President acts on the advice of the Council of Ministers. Hence, it is in effect <strong>the government that decides to bring the Ordinance.</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Effect</strong></td>
<td>An Ordinance shall have the <strong>same force and effect as an Act of Parliament</strong>. However, the government is required to bring an Ordinance before Parliament for ratification.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Life</strong></td>
<td>If the government  fails to get an Ordinance ratified by the Parliament, it will lapse at the <strong>expiration of 6 weeks</strong> from the reassembly of Parliament. Maximum life of an Ordinance = 6 months (recess) + 6 weeks<br><br>The Ordinance <strong>may lapse earlier</strong> – if the President withdraws it or if both Houses pass resolutions disapproving it (imply that the government has lost majority.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Criticism</strong></td>
<td>As lawmaking is a legislative function, Ordinance power is provided to meet urgent situations.<br><br>However, the governments adopt the Ordinance route to <strong>bypass the legislature.</strong><br><br><strong>Repromulgation</strong> of an Ordinance, which extends life of an Ordinance, allows the executive to further seize legislative power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>SC verdicts on the issue</strong></td>
<td><strong>RC Cooper Case 1970:</strong> If an Ordinance is issued solely to bypass the Parliament, the President’s decision to promulgate the Ordinance can be challenged.<br><br> <strong>D C Wadhwa v. State of Bihar 1986:</strong> If the Government ignores the legislature and repromulgate an Ordinance, it would be a colourable exercise of power.<br><br><strong>Krishna Kumar Singh v. State of Bihar 2017:</strong> Reiterated that the Governor’s power to issue an Ordinance is in the nature of an <strong>emergency power.</strong> Repeated re-promulgations without bringing the Ordinance to the legislature would be <strong>unconstitutional</strong>.</td>

<p><strong>Resorting to ordinances has always raised concern on violation of the spirit of separation of powers doctrine. While noting the rationales justifying the power to promulgate ordinances, analyze whether the decisions of the Supreme Court on the issue have further facilitated resorting to this power.

<p><strong>Context:</strong> As India celebrates its achievements, it must build a healthcare system that caters to tribal communities.</p>
<p><strong>Since independence, India has made remarkable strides:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As the world’s <strong>5th-largest economy</strong> and a leader in the digital realm.</li>
<li><strong>Demonstrating the ethos of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam</strong> – One World, One Family.<ul>
<li><strong>For example</strong>, through its <strong>Vaccine Maitri initiative</strong>, India provided over 60 million vaccine doses to nations across the world.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Equitable, affordable and quality</strong> healthcare for 4 billion people.</li>
<li>Finding a way to achieve this without disrupting the identities of tribals.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Healthcare issues faced by  Tribal communities in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>They constitute <strong>9% of the population</strong> and remain the <strong>most neglected and deprived group when it comes to access to healthcare</strong>.</li>
<li>For example, <strong>the mortality rate in tribal areas is 44% higher than the national average</strong>, and infant mortality is 63% higher [Ministry of Tribal Affairs].</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reasons behind poor health indicators among tribals:</strong> They face multifaceted challenges – lack of infrastructure, medical professionals, connectivity, affordability, equipment, insurance, funding, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Health schemes in tribal areas:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/08/09/launch-a-national-tribal-health-mission/"><strong>The National Health Mission (NHM)</strong></a><strong>:</strong> It envisages the achievement of <strong>universal access to equitable, affordable and quality healthcare services</strong> that are accountable and responsive to people’s needs.</li>
<li><strong>Various initiatives supported under the NHM for better healthcare in tribal areas:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Ayushman Bharat-Health and Wellness Centres</strong> (HWCs) are established as part of the Ayushman Bharat programme.</li>
<li><strong>National Free Drugs Service Initiative and National Free Diagnostic Service Initiative</strong> have been rolled out.</li>
<li><strong>The ASHA programme</strong> provides for recruitment of ASHA at habitation level, in hilly, tribal and difficult areas.</li>
<li><strong>National Ambulances Services under NHM</strong> for free transportation of sick patients to the health facilities.</li>
<li>All tribal majority districts whose composite health index is below the State average have been identified as <strong>High Priority Districts</strong> (HPDs)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/tribal_area.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/tribal_area.png" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Urgent need to <strong>empower</strong> tribal communities and ensure they receive <strong>equitable, affordable and accessible healthcare</strong>.<ul>
<li>This can be ensured by suitable <strong>investments</strong> (in medical colleges and training centres across such remote areas)<strong>, public policy and governance.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Empowering tribal communities must be done <strong>strategically</strong>.<ul>
<li>With a more <strong>communitarian</strong> social setup, an <strong>underdeveloped economy</strong> dependent on forest resources and <strong>unique geographic conditions</strong>, their health outcomes necessitate a unique approach.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best practices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mera Baccha Abhiyan:</strong><ul>
<li>It aims to fight malnutrition through <strong>public participatio</strong>n in Datia district, Madhya Pradesh.</li>
<li>As a result, the district witnessed a <strong>drop in malnutrition rates (by 17.5%)</strong>, <strong>rise in immunisation, breastfeeding and a drop in diarrhoea.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Piramal Swasthya – One of the largest implementing agencies of primary healthcare programmes in India:</strong><ul>
<li>It has over a decade’s experience of <strong>working with the tribal communities of Andhra Pradesh</strong>, implementing its <strong>unique community-based model</strong>.</li>
<li>More recently, it has partnered with NITI Aayog to transform the health and nutrition systems in <strong>25 Aspirational Districts</strong> spread across 7 States of India.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As India moves towards <strong>India@100</strong>, the responsibility of providing healthcare (a fundamental human right) for all lies both with <strong>private and government institutions</strong>.</li>
<li>Tribal communities can be empowered by inclusive leadership and investments in healthcare infrastructure, contributing to the UN SDGs.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The 49th annual summit (Hiroshima, Japan) of the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/international-relations/important-international-institutions-agencies-and-further-structure-mandate-etc/g7/">G7</a> leaders concluded recently.</p>

<p><strong>Highlights of the summit:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>G7 countries said that they would <strong>build economic resilience</strong> for themselves, based on a strategy of <strong>diversifying and deepening partnerships and de-risking, not decoupling</strong>.</li>
<li>G7 acknowledged the urgency for effective climate action but offered little in terms of scaled-up action.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What does de-risking and decoupling mean?</strong></p>

<td><strong>De-risking</strong></td>
<td><strong>Decoupling</strong></td>

<tr>
<td>To <strong>move business away from areas</strong> that are considered risky in terms of the returns they could generate.</td>
<td>It is used as an alternative to an economic boycott <strong>to reduce correlation between markets.</strong></td>

<tr>
<td>To have <strong>resilient, effective supply chains</strong> to prevent coercion of any other country.</td>

</tr>
</tbody>

<p><strong>Why was ‘de-risking’ used by G7 countries?</strong> To describe their stance towards China on economic matters.</p>
<p><strong>De-risking in the context of China:</strong> It can be <strong>interpreted as a reduction of the reliance on China</strong> in the economic sphere – for the supply of materials or as a market for finished goods, so that potential risks to trade and disruption of supply chains are reduced.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Recently, CJI Chandrachud has condemned <strong>‘forum shopping’.</strong></p>
<p>Forum shopping refers to the <strong>practice of litigants or lawyers deliberately</strong> selecting a particular <strong>judge or court</strong> where they believe the judgment will be <strong>more favourable to their case</strong>. This practice involves choosing a court that is likely to provide the <strong>most favourable outcome,</strong> rather than following the standard legal process.</p>
<p><strong>Issues with Forum Shopping:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It circumvents the <strong>normal course of justice</strong> and can lead to an <strong>imbalance in the workload</strong> of courts.</li>
<li>The Supreme Court has condemned this practice. It has <strong>no sanction in law</strong> and must be discouraged.</li>
<li><strong>Ethical issues</strong>: Unfair advantage; Manipulation of the legal system</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recourse available with courts in case of ‘forum Shopping’:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Courts may <strong>exercise discretionary powers and refuse jurisdiction</strong> over a matter if another court or forum is more suitable. This ensures that cases are allocated to the appropriate bench and promotes fairness and justice.</li>
<li>Courts can impose fines on litigants</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SC judgements on ‘Forum Shopping’:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SC in 1998 (Chetak Construction Ltd. vs. Om Prakash):</strong> “A litigant <strong>cannot be permitted choice of the forum</strong>,” and that <strong>every attempt at forum shopping</strong> “must be crushed with a heavy hand.”</li>
<li><strong>SC (2017) (‘Union of India &amp; Ors. vs. Cipla Ltd.’):</strong> SC laid down a <strong>“functional test”</strong> to be adopted for forum shopping.</li>
<li><strong>SC (2022) (Vijay Kumar Ghai vs. State of W.B.):</strong> Supreme Court termed forum shopping as a “<strong>disreputable practise by the courts</strong>” that “has no sanction and paramountcy in law”.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Related term:</strong></p>
<p><strong>The practice of “bench hunting”</strong> refers to <strong>petitioners attempting to have their cases</strong> heard by a specific judge or court in order to obtain a favourable order.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The <strong>National Campaign for Updation and Verification of People’s Biodiversity Register (PBR)</strong> was launched in Goa, by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change.</p>
<p><strong>Aim:</strong> It is aimed to <strong>document and preserve India’s rich</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/biodiversity/"><strong>biological diversity</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>About PBR:</strong></p>
<p>The People’s Biodiversity Register serves as a <strong>comprehensive record</strong> of locally available <strong>Bio-resources including the landscape</strong> and demography of a particular area or village. It i<strong>s prepared by Biodiversity Management Committees</strong> (under Biodiversity Act 2002) in consultation with local communities.</p>
<p><strong>About</strong>  <strong>Biodiversity Management Committees</strong></p>
<p>BMCs are <strong>local bodies created</strong> under the <strong>Biological Diversity Act 2002</strong>, with the <strong>mandate</strong> to ensure the <strong>conservation, sustainable utilization and equitable sharing of benefits</strong> from biodiversity.</p>
<p><strong>The act</strong> has made it mandatory for <strong>every local self-governing institution</strong> in rural and urban areas to constitute <strong>Biodiversity Management Committees</strong> within their area of jurisdiction. BMC must <strong>prepare a PBR in consultation</strong> with local people.</p>
<p><strong>Kolkata</strong> was <strong>the first major metropolitan city</strong> in India to make a detailed People’s Biodiversity Register (PBR).

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The government has granted approvals for an <strong>international container port</strong> on the <strong>Great Nicobar Island</strong>, which poses a threat to the survival of <strong>leatherback turtles</strong>, the largest turtles on Earth.</p>
<p><strong>Threats faced by turtles:</strong> Turtles face threats such as loss of nesting sites, fishing activities, boat collisions, egg collection, plastic waste ingestion, and habitat destruction.</p>
<p>The approvals granted for the project have been <strong>criticized for their violation of internationally accepted principles</strong> of biodiversity offsetting. There is <strong>no provision to compensate</strong> for the damage to turtle nesting.</p>
<p><strong>About the turtle</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Giant Leatherback turtle (IUCN: Vulnerable) is the largest of the seven sea turtle</strong> species. It has a leather-like shell and is found in all oceans except the Arctic and the Antarctic. In the Indian Ocean, it nests only in <strong>Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.</strong> It is the only <strong>living species</strong> in its genus and family. The Leatherback is unique among reptiles as it <strong>can generate heat to maintain high body temperatures</strong>. It is protected under <strong>India’s Wildlife Protection Act</strong>. Female Leatherbacks <strong>nest in significant numbers in the Andaman and Nicobar Island</strong>s and then swim towards Australia’s western coast and the eastern coast of Africa.</p>
