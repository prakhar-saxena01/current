<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>To improve food safety in India, <strong>companies should provide evidence to support their claims and modify advertisements</strong> for better consumer understanding. FSSAI and state food authorities should <strong>conduct surveys to ensure better enforcement and administration</strong> of the FSS Act. Compensation and fines should <strong>be increased in cases of injury or death</strong>, and more food testing laboratories should be established.</p>

<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Challenges to Internal Security/Indigenization of Technology</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/25th-anniversary-pokhran-ii-8604356/"><strong>IE</strong></a> </p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> On May 11, 1998, codenamed <strong>Operation Shakti</strong> (literally, “strength”)/Pokhran-II, India conducted three nuclear bomb test explosions at the Indian Army’s Pokhran Test Range.</p>
<p><strong>Timeline of Operation Shakti/Pokhran-II:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Foundation of India’s nuclear programme laid by physicist Homi J Bhaba:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR):</strong> India’s first research institution dedicated to the study of nuclear physics opened (1945) in Bombay, after Bhaba’s successful lobbying.</li>
<li><strong>Department of Atomic Energy (DAE):</strong> Founded in 1954 with Bhabha as director.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The threat of China and Pakistan:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The 1962 Sino-Indian War</strong> and China’s subsequent nuclear bomb test at Lop Nor in 1964.</li>
<li><strong>The 1965 India-Pakistan war</strong>, with China openly supporting Pakistan.</li>
<li>Therefore, India was surrounded by two unfriendly nations and needed to take steps towards building <strong>self-sufficiency.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The “discriminatory” NPT:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>By the 1960s</strong>, discourse around nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation as the Cold War arms race pushed the US and the USSR to great extremes.</li>
<li>In 1968, the <strong>Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)</strong> came into existence, defining nuclear-weapon states as those that have built and tested a nuclear explosive device before January 1, 1967 – the US, Russia (formerly USSR), the UK, France and China.</li>
<li><strong>This disallows any other state from acquiring nuclear weapons.</strong></li>
<li>The government of India <strong>refused to accede to the terms of the treaty</strong> because it failed to address India’s concerns.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pokhran-I/Operation Smiling Buddha:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>By the 1970s, <strong>Vikram Sarabhai</strong> (Bhaba’s successor at the DAE) had worked to significantly broaden India’s nuclear technology.</li>
<li><strong>The Indira Gandhi government</strong> showed political will and on May 18, 1974, India carried out its first nuclear test at the Pokhran test site.</li>
<li>This test was conceptualised as a <strong>“peaceful nuclear explosion” with “few military implications”.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>International sanctions on India post-Pokhran-I:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The world was not willing to buy India’s version of the motive behind Pokhran-I and countries like the <strong>US and Canada</strong> imposed significant sanctions.</li>
<li>These sanctions (majorly on tech transfer) would be a <strong>major setback for India’s nuclear journey</strong> and majorly decelerate its progress.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The period between the two tests:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Domestic political instability:</strong> The Emergency of 1975 and PM Morarji Desai’s opposition to nuclear weapons brought the programme to a grinding halt.</li>
<li><strong>1980s:</strong> Dr APJ Abdul Kalam was made in charge of India’s missile programme (1983) and India exponentially increased its plutonium stockpiles.</li>
<li><strong>1990S:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>With the fall of the USSR in 1991</strong>, India lost one of its biggest military allies.</li>
<li>The US continued to provide military aid to Pakistan.</li>
<li>Discussions regarding a <strong>Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)</strong> were also underway in the UN (it would be finalised in 1996, but India did not sign it).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pokhran-II – Projecting India’s strength:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In 1995</strong>, permission for carrying out a nuclear test was granted. However, logistical and political reasons pushed back the tests further.</li>
<li><strong>In 1998</strong>, the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government showed political will and successfully conducted <strong>Operation Shakti</strong>.</li>
<li>Unlike the 1974 test, the Indian Government <strong>declared itself as a state possessing nuclear weapons</strong> following Pokhran-II.</li>
<li>Though the test invited sanctions from some countries (like the US), <strong>the condemnation was far less than in 1974</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>The test helped India enter the highly guarded club of countries</strong> with the capability to deploy nuclear weapons, helping it to cement its status as a <strong>dominant nation-state.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>India’s nuclear doctrine (presented in 1999) since Pokhran-II:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It highlighted a <strong>credible minimum deterrence (CMD) and a no-first-use (NFU)</strong> policy, while concurrently supporting <strong>non-proliferation and universal disarmament</strong>.</li>
<li>The sole purpose of India’s nuclear deterrence is <strong>to deter adversaries’ use or threat of use of nuclear weapons.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The policy changed India’s image</strong> and the US (once an adversary of India’s nuclear programme) signed a civil nuclear deal with India in 2008, acknowledging India as a <strong>responsible nuclear player.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>India needs actions at two levels for sustainable national security:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>To address immediate security threats</strong> by intelligently building sufficient and resilient retaliatory capability to signal credible deterrence.</li>
<li><strong>To make long-term innovative diplomatic investments</strong> towards the creation of a global environment conducive to peace and universal nuclear disarmament.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Simultaneously, India can leverage the economic, political and cultural appeal to <strong>showcase the advantages of its philosophy of nuclear deterrence</strong>.</li>

<p><strong>Punjab</strong> has become the <strong>first state in India to enforce the “right to walk”</strong> by making it <strong>mandatory for road-owning agencies</strong>, including the <strong>NHAI</strong>, to provide <strong>footpaths and cycle tracks</strong> in all future expansion of roads and construction of new ones.</p>
<p>The state government has issued these directions and instructed all agencies to prepare an action plan to <strong>construct footpaths and cycle tracks</strong> with a time frame and budget provision.</p>
<p><strong>Usage</strong>: The example can used as solution to reduce deaths related to road accidents. It also shows the values of Commitment to safety, Empathy and concern, Responsiveness to citizen’s demands and Commitment to equity</p>

<tr>
<td><strong>Reason for Lower Temperature Rise in India</strong></td>
<td>The relatively lower rise in temperatures over India can be attributed to a <strong>complex set of atmospheric phenomena</strong>, including <strong>heat transfers from the tropics to the poles</strong> through prevailing systems of air circulation.</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Impact of Aerosols</strong></td>
<td><strong>Aerosols scatter sunlight back</strong> so that lesser heat is absorbed by the land.  <strong>Aerosol concentration</strong> in the <strong>Indian region</strong> is quite high. This could also <strong>lower the warming effect.</strong></td>

<p><strong>Context:</strong>  A baby has been born in the UK using a <strong>technique called mitochondrial donation treatment (MDT) (popularly called ‘Three Parents Baby’)</strong>, which involves using the DNA of three people in an effort to prevent children from inheriting incurable diseases.</p>
<p><strong>Working:</strong></p>
<p>The procedure combines the <strong>sperm and eggs from the biological parents</strong> with mitochondria from a donor’s eggs. Harmful <strong>mutations</strong> in <strong>mitochondria</strong>, which are inherited only from the mother, can affect all the children a woman has. As of now, the technique is still in its experimental stage.</p>
