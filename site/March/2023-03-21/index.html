<p><strong>Context:</strong> India is now one of the <strong>fastest-growing economies globally</strong>. However, this <strong>growth has not resulted in a corresponding increase in its Human Development Index (HDI).</strong></p>
<p><strong>About</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/12/17/human-development-index-2/"><strong>Human Development Index</strong></a><strong>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The HDI is a composite statistical measure created by the <strong>United Nations Development Programme</strong> to <strong>evaluate and compare the level of human development</strong> in different regions around the world.</li>
<li>It was introduced in <strong>1990 as an alternative to conventional economic measures such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which do not consider the broader aspects of human development.</strong></li>
<li>The HDI assesses a country’s average accomplishment in three aspects: <strong>a long and healthy life, knowledge, and a decent standard of living</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Human Development Report 2021-22:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>According to the Human Development Report of 2021-22, <strong>India ranks 132 out of 191 countries, behind Bangladesh (129) and Sri Lanka (73).</strong></li>
<li>The HDI <strong>scores range from 0 to 1</strong>, with <strong>higher values indicating higher levels of human development.</strong></li>
<li>The subnational HDI in India shows that <strong>while some states have made considerable progress, others continue to struggle</strong>. Delhi occupies the top spot and Bihar occupies the bottom spot.</li>
<li>The <strong>five states with the highest HDI scores are Delhi, Goa, Kerala, Sikkim, and Chandigarh</strong>. Nineteen states are classified as high human development states, while the <strong>bottom five states are Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, and Assam, with medium levels of human development.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reasons for the wide disparity:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Economic growth</strong> has been <strong>unevenly distributed in India</strong>.<ul>
<li>The top 10% of the Indian population holds over 77% of the wealth.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Quality of education, healthcare and basic amenities</strong> remain a concern.</li>
<li><strong>Not prioritising human development</strong> alongside <strong>economic growth.</strong></li>
<li>Improving access to <strong>quality social services, addressing environmental challenges.</strong></li>
<li>India must <strong>prioritise investments in human development and job creation</strong>, particularly for its youth.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong>  The Petroleum and Natural Gas Ministry has accepted the main recommendations of the Kirit Parikh committee on natural gas pricing, and will be further recommended by them to the Cabinet soon</p>
<p><strong>What is the Kirit Parikh committee?</strong></p>
<p>The committee was constituted last year (2022) to review the existing pricing <strong>formula for domestically produced natural gas</strong> in India.</p>
<p><strong>The current method of gas pricing:</strong></p>
<p>At present, the <strong>government fixes the prices of gas</strong> produced from the old fields of state-run ONGC and OIL (these both account for about <strong>80% of the annual gas output</strong> of 91 billion cubic metres in India)</p>
<p><strong>Need for revision of Gas Pricing?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To ensure a reliable pricing regime:</strong> A price band will ensure a predictable pricing regime for producers and protect consumers by moderating CNG and PNG price spikes.</li>
<li><strong>To raise domestic production:</strong> A better price will incentivise more investment and help raise domestic production (India targets <strong>15% of energy</strong> coming from gas by 2030)</li>
<li><strong>Helps in improving the environment</strong>– dependence on coal and oil needs to be reduced</li>
</ul>

<td><strong>Fixed Ceiling price (till 2027)</strong></td>
<td>·        Implement a <strong>fixed pricing band for APM (</strong>Administrative Price Mechanism<strong>) gas from old fields</strong><br><br>·        The old fields account for <strong>two-thirds of natural gas</strong> produced in India<br><br>·        Currently, <strong>government controls the price</strong> of Gas produced from old fields</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>No-cut category (uninterrupted supply)</strong></td>
<td>·        Some of the sectors have been kept in the <strong>‘no-cut’ category</strong> (meaning that supplies will remain uninterrupted in this category even in case of a decline in production)<br><br>·        E.g., <strong>The city gas and fertilizer sector</strong> will continue to get top priority in the allocation of APM gas.</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>No changes to the existing pricing formula for new fields and fields with difficult geology</strong></td>
<td>·        <strong>New and difficult fields enjoy pricing freedom</strong> to compensate for the greater risk and cost involved in these projects, but they have a <strong>pricing cap</strong>.<br><br>·        The report suggests that the upper cap should be removed from January 1, 2026.<br><br>·        E.g., for fields in the Deep sea or in high-temperature, high-pressure zones.</td>

</table>
<p><strong>Impact of the move:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Good for domestic producers:</strong> It will benefit domestic producers of natural gas in India, as they will now be able to receive a higher price for their products.</li>
<li><strong>Will incentivize domestic production</strong> and lead to an increase in domestic supply.</li>
<li><strong>Will make the pricing of natural</strong> gas more <strong>transparent and efficient</strong></li>
<li><strong>This will help raise the share of gas in India’s energy</strong> mix <strong>to 15% by 2030</strong> from around <strong>4%</strong> at present.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Administrative Price Mechanism (APM):</strong></p>
<p><strong>To prevent hoarding, maintain the prices of essential goods</strong> (such as Gas) at reasonable levels, and ensure their easy availability, the government fixes the prices of certain commodities. This is known as the administered price mechanism.</p>
<p><strong>About natural gas:</strong></p>
<p>Natural gas, also <strong>called methane gas or natural methane gas</strong>, is a colourless highly flammable gaseous hydrocarbon consisting <strong>primarily of methane and ethane</strong>. It is a type of petroleum that commonly occurs in association with crude oil. It can be used as a <strong>domestic and industrial fuel.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: India has become world No. 2 in sugar export, behind only Brazil.</p>
<p><strong>Data:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>India’s sugar export (in 2016-17) was <strong>0.</strong><strong>46 lakh tonnes (lt),</strong> which has now increased to <strong>110 lt by 2021-22</strong>.</li>
<li>India is the <strong>world’s largest producer and consumer of sugar</strong></li>
<li><strong>Importers of Indian Raw Sugar</strong>: Indonesia, Bangladesh, and Saudi Arabia</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ind_sugar.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ind_sugar.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Types of Sugar:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Raw Brown sugar:</strong> Raw sugar is what mills produce after the <strong>first crystallisation of juice</strong> obtained from the crushing of cane. This sugar is rough and brownish in colour.<ul>
<li><strong>Most of the world’s sugar trade is in ‘raws’</strong> and they can be transported in bulk vessels and requires no bagging or containerisation.</li>
<li>Till 2017-18, India hardly exported any raw sugar.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Refined White sugar</strong>: Raw sugar after being processed in refineries for the removal of impurities and de-colourisation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advantages of Indian raw sugar in the International Market:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Season advantage:</strong> India’s crushing is from October to April, whereas Brazilian mills operate from April to November. Hence, importers are utilising Indian raw sugar during Brazil’s off-season.</li>
<li><strong>Freight cost savings:</strong> India is much closer to its major sugar importers (compared to Brazil) and therefore less freight cost.</li>
<li><strong>Indian sugar is free of dextran</strong>: Dextran is a bacterial compound formed when sugarcane stays in the sun for too long after harvesting.</li>
<li><strong>Indian raw sugar has no dextran</strong>, as it is produced from fresh cane crushed within 12-24 hours of harvesting (compared to 48 hours or more in Brazil)</li>
<li>India’s sugar has a <strong>higher % of sucrose present</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Government Policies for higher Sugar Production:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pricing:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Fair and remunerative price (FRP):</strong>The FRP is the minimum price that sugar mills have to pay to sugarcane farmers for the procurement of sugarcane.</li>
<li><strong>State-Advised Price</strong>: Although the Central government decides the FRP the state governments can also set a State Advised price that a sugar mill has to pay to the farmers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Encouraging Ethanol Production</strong> to be used in Ethanol Blending with Petrol (EBP) Programme</li>
<li>Scheme for Extending Financial Assistance to Sugar Undertakings (<strong>SEFASU</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>National Policy on Biofuels</strong>2018</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Concerns:</strong></p>
<p>Lower stocks, lower production and concerns about domestic availability and food inflation have led the government to <strong>cap India’s exports</strong> in the current sugar year. However, once the overseas markets are lost, they are not easy to regain.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rangarajan committee (2012)</strong> has recommended the abolition of the quantitative controls on the export and import of sugar, these should be replaced by appropriate tariffs.</p>

<p><strong>About Sugar Industry:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The sugar industry is the <strong>second largest agro-based industry</strong> in India after cotton.</li>
<li><strong>Employment</strong>: 50 million sugarcane farmers and around 5 lakh workers are directly employed in sugar mills.</li>

<p><strong>Q According to India’s National Policy on Biofuels, which of the following can be used as raw materials for the production of biofuels? (UPSC 2020)</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Cassava</li>
<li>Damaged wheat grains</li>
<li>Groundnut seeds</li>
<li>Horse gram</li>
<li>Rotten potatoes</li>
<li>Sugar beet</li>
</ol>
<p>Select the correct answer using the code given below:</p>
<p>(a) 1, 2, 5 and 6 only<br />
(b) 1, 3, 4 and 6 only<br />
(c) 2, 3, 4 and 5 only<br />
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6</p>
<p><strong>Ans: A</strong></p>
<p>The National Policy on Biofuels, 2018, allows the production of ethanol from sugarcane juice, sugar-containing materials like sugar beet, and sweet sorghum, starch-containing materials like corn, cassava, damaged food grains like wheat, broken rice, rotten potatoes, unfit for human consumption.</p>
<p><strong>With reference to the current trends in the cultivation of sugarcane in India, consider the following statements: (UPSC 2020)</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>A substantial saving in seed material is made when ‘bud chip settlings’ are raised in a nurse and transplanted in the main field.</li>
<li>When direct planting of setts is done, the germination percentage is better with single-budded setts as compared to setts with many buds.</li>
<li>If bad weather conditions prevail when setts are directly planted, single-budded setts have better survival as compared to large setts.</li>
<li>Sugarcane can be cultivated using settlings prepared from tissue culture.</li>
</ol>
<p>Which of the statements given above is/are correct?</p>
<p>(a) 1 and 2 only<br />
(b) 3 only<br />
(c) 1 and 4 only<br />
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> According to an IPCC report, climate change is a threat to human well-being and planetary health and a window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all is fast closing.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/IPCC.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/IPCC.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Through its multiple assessment cycles beginning in 1990, the IPCC has analysed research by scientists on<ul>
<li>Global warming,</li>
<li>The role humans have had in exacerbating it,</li>
<li>The long-term climate impact from current and future emissions and what people can do about it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The IPCC does not itself undertake scientific assessments but <strong>only evaluates the state of scientific evidence</strong> on various aspects of climate change.</li>
<li>The 6th Assessment Report (AR6) <strong>assesses scientific, technical, and socio-economic information concerning climate change.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About the Synthesis Report:</strong> This is the <strong>final report</strong> of the AR6, which integrates findings from six reports (3 working groups + 3 special reports) released by IPCC during the cycle which began in 2015.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights of the Synthesis report of the AR6:</strong></p>

<p><strong>6 key messages for policymakers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Excess emissions from human activities have raised <strong>global temperature by 1.1°C</strong> above 1850-1900.</li>
<li><strong>Current policy action will lead to further temperature rise</strong>, and the impacts on humans and other forms of life will become more severe.</li>
<li>At current emissions levels, we will <strong>deplete the remaining carbon budget</strong> (of 500 GtCO2).</li>
<li>We need to <strong>cut GHG emissions across all sectors urgently</strong>, within this decade and no later.</li>
<li>We have <strong>all the solutions</strong> we need to shift to low-carbon economic systems. These include –<ul>
<li>Widespread electrification,</li>
<li><strong>Diversifying energy generation</strong> to include more wind, solar, and small-scale hydropower,</li>
<li><strong>Deploying more battery-powered electric vehicles</strong>, and</li>
<li>Conserving and restoring forests while also reducing tropical deforestation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Political commitment and equity</strong> are key to enabling this shift – there is enough finance, it needs to be directed to climate action</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overshooting 1.5°C</strong> (expected in the early 2030s) <strong>will result in irreversible adverse impacts</strong> on certain ecosystems with low resilience (polar, mountain, coastal ecosystems, etc).</li>
<li><strong>Adaptation gaps</strong> exist and will continue to grow if no action is taken and the lower-income group will suffer the most.<ul>
<li>Though developed countries commit to jointly <strong>mobilise $100 billion</strong> in climate finance annually, current global financial flows for adaptation are <strong>insufficient</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some parts of the world (tropical, coastal, polar and mountain ecosystems) have already <strong>reached their adaptation limits.</strong><ul>
<li>This means adaptive actions cannot avoid negative impacts there.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is <strong>increased evidence of maladaptation</strong> (changes in natural/human systems that inadvertently increase vulnerability to climate stimuli) in various sectors and regions.<ul>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> mangrove plantation in coastal Odisha has disturbed the local ecosystems, <strong>affecting marginalised and vulnerable groups adversely.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are multiple barriers (variable impacts, risks and co-benefits in deploying them) to implementing <strong>carbon capture and storage (CCS)</strong> – a climate change mitigation tool that removes CO2 from the atmosphere</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implications of the report for India:</strong> Increased frequency and intensity of <strong>extreme weather events</strong> – could have dire consequences for agriculture, the economy and public health.</p>
<p><strong>Opportunity:</strong> There is a 50-50 chance that by 2030, the global surface temperature in any individual year could exceed 1.5C.</p>
<p><strong>Recent efforts: The loss and damage (L&amp;D)</strong> finance facility, which came into prominence during the COP27 (Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt) to the UNFCCC, aims to provide financial assistance to nations most vulnerable and impacted by the effects of climate change.</p>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Engaging public-private sector to mobilise sufficient finances</li>
<li>Citizens must be provided with <strong>climate literacy</strong> to drive political commitment, research and urgency towards adaptation.</li>
<li>Enabling conditions such as policy instruments, greater public support and technological innovation could reduce barriers to <strong>CCS</strong>.</li>
<li>The policymakers must <strong>prioritise investments in disaster risk reduction</strong>, including early warning systems, evacuation plans, and infrastructure development to protect vulnerable populations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Certain future changes are unavoidable but could be limited by <strong>deep, rapid and sustained global GHG emissions reduction</strong> based on the principle of <strong>c</strong>limate justice.</li>
<li>Therefore, mainstreaming effective and equitable climate action will not only reduce losses and damages, but will also provide wider benefits.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has released <strong>Ethical Guidelines for AI in Healthcare and Biomedical Research</strong> to guide the effective, safe development/deployment/adoption of AI-based technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>India has a host of frameworks which marry technological advances with healthcare. These include –<ul>
<li>The Digital Health Authority for leveraging Digital health Technologies under the National Health Policy (2017),</li>
<li>The Digital Information Security in Healthcare Act (DISHA) 2018 and</li>
<li>The Medical Device Rules, 2017.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> (AI) has made inroads into every sector and healthcare is no exception.</li>
<li>Diagnosis and screening, therapeutics, preventive treatments, clinical decision-making, public health surveillance, etc., are among the recognised applications of AI in healthcare.</li>
<li>Since AI cannot be held accountable for the decisions it makes, <strong>an ethically sound policy framework is essential to guide AI technology development</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Highlights of the guidelines:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It outlined <strong>10 key patient-centric ethical principles</strong> for AI application in the health sector for all stakeholders involved.</li>
<li>These are <strong>accountability and liability, autonomy, data privacy, collaboration</strong>, risk minimisation and safety, accessibility and equity, optimisation of data quality, non-discrimination and fairness, validity and trustworthiness.</li>
<li>The ethical review process came under the domain of the <strong>ethics committee</strong> which assesses a host of factors including data source, quality, safety, anonymization, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance of the guidelines:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The autonomy principle ensures human oversight</strong> of the functioning and performance of the AI system.<ul>
<li>It is also critical to attain <strong>informed consent from the patient</strong> on the physical, psychological and social risks involved.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It aims to prevent <strong>unintended or deliberate misuse</strong> and cyber attacks and mandates a <strong>benefit-risk assessment by an ethical committee</strong>.</li>
<li>It underlines the importance of <strong>regular internal and external audits</strong> to ensure the optimum functioning of AI systems.</li>
<li>It acknowledges the widespread availability of appropriate infrastructure and thus aims <strong>to bridge the digital divide.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standard practices</strong> to make the AI-based solutions technically sound, ethically justified and applicable to a large number of individuals with <strong>equity and fairness</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>All the stakeholders should adhere to these guiding principles</strong> to make the technology more useful and acceptable to the users and beneficiaries of the technology.</li>

<ul>
<li>Entered into force on April 24 1964, the Convention is <strong>nearly universally ratified</strong>, with Palau and South Sudan being the exceptions.</li>
<li>It provides <strong>a complete framework for the establishment/maintenance/termination</strong> of diplomatic relations on a basis of consent between independent sovereign States.</li>
<li><strong>It codifies the longstanding custom of</strong> <strong>diplomatic immunity</strong>, in which diplomatic missions are granted privileges, enabling diplomats to function without fear of coercion or harassment by the host country.</li>
<li>It affirms the concept of “<strong>inviolability</strong>” of a diplomatic mission, which has been one of the enduring cornerstones of international diplomacy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Article 22 of the Convention</strong>: It deals with obligations with regard to the premises of the Mission – <strong>the receiving/host State is mandated to take all appropriate steps</strong> to protect the premises of the mission against any intrusion or damage.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Central government has <strong>designed a scheme for rewarding states that push organic farming in a measure to cut ballooning subsidies for chemical fertilizers</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The scheme–<strong>PM programme for restoration, awareness, nourishment and melioration of mother earth (PM Pranam)</strong></li>
<li>The scheme is designed to <strong>check excessive and indiscriminate use of chemical fertilizers as part of the government’s efforts to make farming more sustainable</strong>. Robust agriculture growth, price stability of farm produce, and sustainability are <strong>priorities for NITI Aayog in the farm sector</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Features of the Scheme:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The scheme will have no separate budget and will be financed through the <strong>“savings of existing fertiliser subsidy” under schemes run by the Department of Fertilizers.</strong></li>
<li><strong>50% of subsidy saving</strong>s will be passed on as <strong>a grant to the state that saves the money.</strong></li>
<li><strong>70% of the grant provided under the scheme can be used for asset creation related to the technological adoption of alternate fertilisers</strong>and alternate fertiliser production units at the village, block and district levels.</li>
<li>The <strong>remaining 30% of grant money can be used for rewarding and encouraging farmers, panchayats, farmer producer organisations and self-help groups</strong> that are involved in the reduction of fertiliser use and awareness generation.</li>
<li>For this purpose, data available on a <strong>Fertilizer Ministry dashboard, IFMS (Integrated Fertilizers Management System) will be used.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How much is the fertilizer subsidy burden of India?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The government had <strong>originally estimated only about ₹1 trillion for</strong> making plant nutrients available to <strong>farmers at affordable prices in FY23 but later sought additional spending permission from Parliament.</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>revised fertilizer subsidy estimate for this fiscal is around ₹2.25 trillion mainly owing to supply disruptions and price escalation in global markets following the Russia-Ukraine war.</strong></li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> A study by scientists at the <strong>Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC)</strong> has found that natural background radiation levels in parts of <strong>Kerala are nearly three times higher than</strong> previously assumed.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons for higher radiation level:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>presence of granite and basaltic, volcanic rock</strong> has led to higher levels of radiation from <strong>uranium</strong> deposits in southern India.</li>
<li>The higher radiation levels in Kollam, Kerala are attributed to <strong>monazite sands</strong> that are high in <strong>thorium</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Risk</strong>: There is no elevated health risk, as the human body is accustomed to higher doses of radiation.</p>
<p><strong>About Radiation:</strong></p>
<p>Radiation results from the <strong>disintegrating nucleus</strong> of an unstable element. These can be from anywhere, including inside human bodies, constituents of matter, and natural sources such as rocks, sand or mountains.</p>
<p><strong>International Atomic Energy Agency</strong> (IAEA) <strong>specifies public radiation exposure</strong> should not exceed 1 millisievert every year (India’s average is <strong>0.8 millisievert/year</strong>)</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> According to a new report<strong>, India has seen the highest rise in deforestation</strong> in the last 30 years, <strong>with a stark surge recorded between 2015 and 2020</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Key highlights in the report:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cattle rearing was the leading cause of global deforestation</strong>, leading to a loss of 2,105,753 ha annually. This was followed by the <strong>cultivation of oil seeds that caused 950,609 ha of forestry loss.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Logging is the third highest factor</strong> responsible for deforestation, causing around 678,744 ha of annual deforestation globally.</li>
<li>The report further revealed that while <strong>Brazil has reduced its deforestation by 2,559,100 ha from 2015 to 2020 and Indonesia by 1,876,000 ha</strong> for the same period<strong>, India’s figures have only increased significantly.</strong></li>
