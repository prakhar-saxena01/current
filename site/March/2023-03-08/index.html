<h4 id="gs-paper-1"><strong>GS Paper 1</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Geophysical phenomenon</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-reports-542-forest-fires-in-last-7-days-highest-in-india-fsi-survey-101678162284798.html"><strong>HT</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong>  Forest fires continued to remain unabated in Odisha after the state recorded 542 such cases in the last seven days making it the highest among all states in the country.</p>
<p><strong>Forest fires in India:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Causes of a Forest fire:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Natural:</strong> Such as <strong>lightning</strong>, high atmospheric temperatures, and dryness (low humidity) offer favourable circumstances.</li>
<li><strong>Man-made:</strong> When a source of fire like naked flame, cigarette, or bidi comes into contact with inflammable material.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Types of a forest fire:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Surface fire:</strong> Spread along the surface litter (leaves, twigs, dry grasses) on the forest floor.</li>
<li><strong>Ground fire</strong>: Fires in the <strong>subsurface organic fuels</strong>, such as duff layers under forest stands, burn <strong>underneath</strong> and are often ignited by surface fires.</li>
<li><strong>Crown fire</strong>: A crown fire is one in which the crown of trees and shrubs burn, often sustained by a surface fire.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Good/bad:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Helps in the evolution of forests</strong> (such as dry deciduous forests and savannahs)<strong>,</strong></li>
<li><strong>Landscape/disease management</strong> (indigenous people like the Soligas have used controlled forest fires to reduce incidences of tick-borne diseases),</li>
<li>Controls the growth of <strong>invasive species, etc.</strong></li>
<li>However, forest fires can have <strong>lasting negative impacts on biodiversity</strong> (loss of flora, fauna, ecological services), the <strong>economic stability</strong> of many communities that live in forests, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Vulnerability:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>~<strong>65%</strong> of Indian forests are prone to occasional/frequent forest fire events.</li>
<li><strong>Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh</strong> were the most impacted states and <strong>Gadchiroli, Kandhamal, and Bijapur</strong> were the most impacted districts.</li>
<li>The youngest mountain ranges of the <strong>Himalayas</strong>/chirr (Pine) forests (Western &gt; Eastern as E. Himalayas grow in high rain density) are the most vulnerable stretches of the world.</li>
<li>There has been a <strong>10-fold increase</strong> in forest fire incidences in the last two decades.</li>
<li>According to the MoEFCC, the country <strong>reported 3,45,989 forest fire</strong> incidents during (Nov 2020 and June 2021) and the state of Odisha reported 51,968 – the highest in India.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact of climate change:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It might lead to more wildfire-inducing ‘<strong>hot lightning</strong>’ strikes.<ul>
<li>Hot lightning or l<strong>ong continuing current strikes</strong> (which can last up to a third of a second) are more likely to ignite wildfires than typical lightning strikes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Preparedness and mitigation measures:</strong> Forest fires are usually <strong>seasonal</strong>. Hence, fires can be prevented in the summer –</p>
<ul>
<li>Through the removal of forest litter all along the forest boundary (“<strong>Forest Fire Line</strong>“).</li>
<li><strong>By creating firebreaks</strong>/ ditches in the forests.</li>
<li><strong>The FSI is using satellite imaging technology</strong> –<ul>
<li>To set up fire alert systems (<strong>MODIS, SNPP</strong>) and analyse fire-affected forest areas</li>
<li>To better understand the ecology of forest fires for restoration and fire prevention efforts</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Landfill fires are becoming a big challenge for India’s urban civic bodies (recently in Kochi)</p>
<p><strong>Recent incidents:</strong> Ghazipur, Delhi’s Bhalswa, and Chennai’s Perungudi</p>
<p><strong>What triggers landfill fires?</strong></p>
<p>●        A landfill site is <strong>a site for the disposal of waste materials</strong> and is the <strong>oldest and most common</strong> form of waste disposal.</p>
<p>●        The landfill sites in India are <strong>not scientifically planned</strong>.</p>
<p>●        The wastes are <strong>not segregated</strong> due to which the landfill sites receive mixed wastes which <strong>include organic waste/ignitable material/plastics</strong>.</p>
<p>●        <strong>The anaerobic decomposition</strong> (breakdown of organic waste in the absence of oxygen) generates <strong>methane gas and heat</strong>.</p>
<p>●        As soon as the methane gas comes in contact with oxygen, the combustible materials at the dumping site catch fire easily.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong> The landfill fires take time to exhaust due to several factors which include –</p>
<p>●        <strong>Multiple ignition points,</strong></p>
<p>●        <strong>Lack of constant water supply</strong> and</p>
<p>●        The danger involved in climbing the tall mounds of garbage.</p>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong> The Solid Waste Management Rules 2016 state that <strong>only non-recyclable, non-biodegradable, and non-combustible waste</strong> should go to a sanitary landfill.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The theme for International Women’s Day 2023 is ‘<strong>DigitALL: Innovation and Technology for Gender Equality.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Data on Digital Disparity:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>According to <strong>a UNICEF report, as many as 90% of the jobs</strong> in the world today have <strong>a digital component.</strong> These jobs, however, are available only to the <strong>digitally able, and to more men than women.</strong></li>
<li>According to the report, <strong>in developing countries, only 41% of women have access to the internet compared with 53% of men</strong>.<ul>
<li>Women are <strong>20% less likely to own a smartphone and are more likely to borrow phones from a male family member.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Another report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development revealed that the <strong>gender gap in internet use is widening</strong>. Software development remains a male-dominated field, with women comprising <strong>only 15% of software designers</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples of how digital literacy helps in tackling issues:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>FoSafMDM application</strong> by the <strong>United Nations World Food Programme (WFP)</strong> in partnership with the <strong>Governments of Odisha and Rajasthan has rolled out technology-based training modules</strong></li>
<li>This helps in <strong>strengthening the capacity of the community</strong> in ensuring that proper hygiene and safety measures <strong>are followed so that children reap the full benefits of the nutrition that these school meals offer.</strong></li>
<li>Young women known as ‘<strong>Digital Sakhis’ from Madhya Pradesh are upturning discriminatory social norms through the use of smartphones</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Indian situation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>India accounts for <strong>half the world’s gendered</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/science-technology/communication-and-it-technology/digital-divide/#:~:text=Digital%20divide%20is%20any%20uneven,or%20geopolitical%20criteria%2C%20or%20otherwise."><strong>digital divide</strong></a> given that <strong>only a third of all Internet users in the country are women.</strong></li>
<li>In Asia-Pacific<strong>, India has the widest gender gap of 40%. Less than 32% of women in India own a mobile phone compared to over 60% of men.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Women can harness digital tools for improving nutrition schemes and initiatives, while also using them to <strong>create economic opportunities that ensure long-term food and nutrition security</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Women20—the G20’s official engagement platform</strong> to promote gender equity—<strong>identifies “bridging the gender digital divide”</strong> as one of its five priorities that need to be mainstreamed as part of the G20 agenda this year.</li>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: A group of scientists, at the Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, has come up with a solution where <strong>healthy skin cells from an adult can be converted into heart cells using special proteins</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>More about the technology:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>According to scientists, <strong>converting cells from one form to another – a.k.a. cellular reprogramming – involves specific proteins, called transcription factors</strong>, that alter the “expression of genes within a cell and direct it to take on a new cellular identity”.</li>
<li>They developed a toolbox, which consists of six recombinant proteins: <strong>GATA4, MEF2C, TBX5, ETS2, MESP1, and HAND2</strong>.</li>
<li>Each of these proteins plays a significant role in <strong>reprogramming fibroblasts</strong> – a type of cells that provides structure to tissue – <strong>into cardiomyocytes</strong>.</li>
<li>The advantage of <strong>recombinant proteins-based cell conversion</strong> is they work their miracle inside the nucleus and eventually disappear over time <strong>without leaving behind their toxic waste, unlike their genetic counterparts.</strong> Thus, they are very safe for reprogramming compared to other approaches</li>
