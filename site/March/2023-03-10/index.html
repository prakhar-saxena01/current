<h4 id="gs-paper-2"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Social Justice (Issues related to women)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/data/india-not-on-target-in-many-women-related-development-goals/article66591271.ece#:~:text=The%20critical%20off%2Dtarget%20indicators,districts%20analysed%20were%20off%2Dtarget."><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> A recent analysis (in The Lancet) has concluded that India is not on-target to achieve 19 of the 33 SDGs indicators.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The SDGs were adopted by the UN in <strong>2015</strong> with a vision to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all.</li>
<li>India is <strong>one of the signatory countries</strong> that has committed to achieving these goals by <strong>2030</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/un-goals.png"><img alt="Current Affairs" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/un-goals.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Achievements: The 5 indicators</strong> with the highest number of districts that <strong>have met the target</strong> area –</p>
<ul>
<li>Adolescent pregnancy</li>
<li>Multidimensional poverty</li>
<li>Electricity access</li>
<li>Bank accounts</li>
<li>Improved sanitation</li>
<li>Full vaccination</li>
<li>Internet use</li>
<li>Skilled birth attendants</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The critical off-target indicators</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access to basic services</li>
<li>Wasting and overweight children</li>
<li>Anaemia</li>
<li>Child marriage</li>
<li>Domestic violence</li>
<li>Tobacco use</li>
<li>Modern contraceptive use</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Worst performer:</strong> More than 75% of the 707 districts analysed were off-target, concentrated in the States of <strong>MP, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Bihar, and Odisha</strong></p>
<p><strong>Focus areas of 2023 International Women’s Day (March 8):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The 2023 IWD was commemorated under the theme <strong>“DigitALL: Innovation and technology for gender equality”.</strong></li>
<li>However, women’s lack of access to technology and digital tools makes them less likely to be a part of the wider domains of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics <strong>(STEM) fields.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Globally</strong>, 18% of girls in higher-level education are pursuing STEM studies, compared with 35% of boys.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Case of India – The gender gap in STEM:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>According to the All India Survey of Higher Education (2020-2021), in UG, PG, MPhil and PhD <strong>engineering</strong> programmes, 71% of enrolled students were males and <strong>29% were females.</strong></li>
<li>But of all students enrolled in <strong>science</strong> courses at UG, PG, MPhil and PhD levels, <strong>women at 53%</strong> of enrolment outnumbered men.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why does the gap exist?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Presence of existing resources such as mentors and programmes offering scholarships</li>
<li>General <strong>societal attitudes</strong> on women’s education</li>
<li><strong>Gender bias in curricula</strong>. In India, more than 50% of illustrations in math and science textbooks show boys and only 6% show illustrations of girls.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recent initiatives/achievements by/of the GoI:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To mark the IWD 2023, the Union Ministry of Science &amp; Technology announced <strong>an exclusive women’s portal</strong> for research grants and funds under <strong>CSIR-ASPIRE</strong>.</li>
<li>68% of 2 crore <strong>PM Awas-Gramin</strong> beneficiaries are women and over 23 crore <strong>MUDRA loans</strong> have been granted to women beneficiaries.</li>
<li>For the first time, <strong>sex ratio in India</strong> has improved to 1,020 women per 1,000 men (NFHS-5).</li>
<li><strong>Permanent Commission for Women</strong> in the Armed Forces. Over <strong>10,000 Women Officers</strong> are currently serving in the Armed Forces, the majority in the Medical Services.</li>
<li>Group Captain <strong>Shaliza Dhami</strong> – the first woman officer to command a missile squadron in the Western sector facing Pakistan.</li>

<h4 id="gs-paper-3"><strong>GS Paper 3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Infrastructure: Energy, Ports, Roads, Airports, Railways etc</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/the-ideal-track-to-run-indias-logistics-system/article66600836.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Union Budget 2023 has doubled the <strong>PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan</strong> to States to ₹10,000 crores, and has announced an outlay of <strong>₹2.4 lakh</strong> crore for the <strong>Indian Railways</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Why is the increased adoption of the railways crucial?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Railways</strong> → pan-India network → <strong>offers an efficient and economic mode of logistics movement</strong> → enabling a <strong>coordinated and</strong> <strong>integrated</strong> logistics system.</li>
<li><strong>To improve India’s logistics competitiveness.</strong><ul>
<li>In 2020-21, coal constituted 44% of the total freight movement of <strong>1.</strong><strong>2 billion</strong> tonnes, followed by iron ore (13%), cement, food grains, fertilisers, etc.</li>
<li>Transportation of <strong>non-bulk commodities accounts for a very small share</strong> of the rail freight movement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges faced by Indian railways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The national transporter faces several <strong>infrastructural, operational and connectivity challenges</strong>, in turn leading to a <strong>shift of freight traffic to roads</strong> (<strong>65%</strong>).</li>
<li>The effect is an increased burden on roads, congestion, pollution, and <strong>resultant logistics cost escalations</strong> (nearly twice the rail cost).</li>
<li>An increase in containerised traffic (for non-bulk commodities) over the last decade.</li>
<li><strong>The absence of integrated first and last-mile connectivity</strong> by rail increases the chances of damage due to multiple handling and also increases the inventory holding cost.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Global examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Globally, railway systems are <strong>heavily investing in advanced rail infrastructure</strong> for quick and low-cost container movement.</li>
<li><strong>For example</strong>, <strong>China</strong> uses special trains to carry containers that connect significant ports to the inland.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Role to be played by the PM Gati Shakti:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It provides the right platform to address the infrastructural challenges that have hampered the movement of freight by rail.</li>
<li><strong>Target</strong> – Increasing the share of the railways in freight movement from <strong>27% to 45%</strong> (from <strong>1.</strong><strong>2 to 3.3</strong> billion tonnes) by <strong>2030</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead to achieve the targets of rail freight movement:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>C<strong>ontinuous monitoring of existing projects</strong> (like PM Gati Shakti) along with identification of new priority areas.</li>
<li><strong>Improve infrastructure</strong> that is backed by adequate policy tools and also encourage private participation.</li>
<li>For example, the upcoming <strong>Dedicated Freight Corridors</strong> and multimodal logistics parks will ease the oversaturated line capacity and improve the train timings.</li>
<li><strong>Establishing a special entity</strong> under the railways to handle intermodal logistics will help in addressing the <strong>first and last-mile issues</strong> faced by the railways.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> An integrated logistics infrastructure with first and last-mile connectivity is essential to make rail movement competitive with roads, and facilitate exports by rail to neighbouring countries such as Nepal and Bangladesh.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong>  A new study published in the <strong>journal Nature Communications</strong> has warned of the potential consequences of <strong>gene editing technology</strong>, which is still not fully understood.</p>
<p><strong>Key findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Using Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (</strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/science-technology/biotechnology/what-is-crispr-cas9/"><strong>CRISPR</strong></a><strong>)</strong> to delete harmful disease-causing mutations could create more problems<ul>
<li>CRISPR could lead to <strong>extensive gene copying</strong> from one parent to another, potentially increasing the risk of diseases</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The extent of the <strong>DNA damage induced by CRISPR</strong> and how cells respond to it is still not fully known</li>
<li>The technology used to <strong>test gene-edited embryos</strong> could reduce the accuracy of genetic testing, leading to the misdiagnosis of embryos.</li>
<li>The researchers concluded that <strong>such limitations must be addressed</strong> before gene editing technology can be used.</li>
</ul>
<p>Previously, a <strong>Chinese scientist</strong> who announced the birth of <strong>gene-edited twins in 2018</strong>, had used CRISPR to make the embryos resistant to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).</p>
<p><strong>About Gene-editing:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Genome editing</strong> (also called gene editing) is a group of technologies that allow genetic material to be added, removed, or altered at particular locations in the genome.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Three technology mostly used for gene-editing are</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/science-technology/biotechnology/what-is-crispr-cas9/">CRISPR-associated protein 9</a> (Cas9), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs).</li>

<p><strong>Advantages of AI:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Disruptive technology <strong>creates new jobs and skill sets</strong> by creating demand for expertise in machine learning, data science and natural language processing.</li>
<li>It will transform industries by <strong>creating new opportunities for growth and innovation.</strong></li>
<li><strong>In industries like healthcare</strong>, AI can optimise transportation networks, develop new materials, and even simplify manufacturing processes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Threats:</strong> ChatGPT/similar solutions <strong>are proficient at automating routine and repetitive tasks</strong> (data entry, customer service) which could perhaps <strong>replace low-skill level workers</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The impact of AI on jobs and industries is likely to be <strong>uneven</strong>. Hence, <strong>significant investment in education and training programs</strong> and proactive policies is the need of the hour.</p>

<p><strong>The science behind AI: Neural Network</strong></p>
<p>A neural network is a <strong>computer system designed to learn and recognize patterns</strong>, like a simplified version of the human brain. It consists of layers of interconnected nodes or “<strong>neurons</strong>,” each of which performs a simple computation.</p>
<p>Neural networks have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their <strong>ability to learn complex patterns and make accurate predictions</strong>. They have been used in a variety of applications, including self-driving cars, speech recognition, and medical diagnosis.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Since September 2022, India has translocated eight African cheetahs from <strong>Namibia</strong> and 12 from <strong>South Africa.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This is part of <strong>a long-term conservation plan to re-introduce</strong> the wild cat into the country after it became extinct in the <strong>1950s</strong>, primarily due to hunting.</li>
<li>The aim is to build a <strong>self-sustaining population</strong>, centred at MP’s Kuno National Park, which will also contribute to the global survival of the cheetah as a species.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are Grasslands?</strong></p>
<p>Grasslands (e.g. prairies or savannas) are biomes characterized by vast expanses of grasses and a few scattered trees. They are found in regions where there is not enough rain to support forests but where there is enough rainfall to prevent the land from becoming a desert.</p>
<ul>
<li>Grasslands are typically located in the <strong>interior regions of continents</strong>, away from the moderating influence of oceans.</li>
<li>Approximately <strong>24 per cent</strong>of total vegetation cover is grassland in India</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Can the cheetahs help India’s grasslands?</strong></p>

<td>●       Cheetahs may not help in restoring grasslands until India addresses other issues.<br><br>●       For example,<br><br>○        The <strong>Wasteland Atlas of India</strong> still categorises large stretches of open natural ecosystems as <strong>wasteland</strong>.<br><br>○        <strong>Renewable energy projects</strong> are granted large tracts of open natural ecosystems, to establish solar panels.<br><br>○        The level of human presence is high in these grasslands</td>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> African cheetah is a species which has never been to India. Yet, its very introduction will enable India ‘if not wholly but in some measure’ revive its magnificent grasslands.</p>

<p>Children, esp. in developing and poor countries, miss out on important vaccine shots, also known as <strong>zero-dose (</strong>one in eight children was zero-dose — not received a vaccine of any kind )</p>
<p><strong>Strategies to address this problem:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Involving Communities in immunization and awareness</strong>: E.g. Using traditional systems such as community leaders, and local people from communities as immunisation vanguards and religious structures.</li>
<li><strong>Using technology:</strong>g. Zipline, a service that uses drones to deliver vaccines in flooded and hard-to-reach areas</li>
<li><strong>Mobile vaccination clinics:</strong> This strategy can help increase access to vaccines and reduce the burden of travel on families.</li>
<li><strong>School-based vaccination programs</strong>: This strategy can be particularly useful for adolescents who may be less likely to visit a healthcare provider regularly.</li>
<li><strong>Text message reminders:</strong> This strategy can help reduce missed appointments and increase vaccine uptake.</li>
<li><strong>Social media campaigns</strong>: Social media campaigns can help reach a wide audience and engage parents and caregivers in the vaccination process.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Usage</strong>: The strategies can be used as solutions in questions related to Health, Low Immunization, Vaccine resistance</p>

<p><strong>Factors behind the long sustenance of Cyclone Freddy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Global warming</strong>: Absorption of human-induced greenhouse gases by the oceans, which increases their heat content, thus helping to strengthen cyclones.</li>
<li><strong>Low horizontal wind shear favoured its rapid intensification</strong>: Horizontal wind shear is the horizontal winds around a cyclone.<ul>
<li>When these winds have lower speeds they help a cyclone grow in strength and when they have higher speeds they make it dissipate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Warm sub-surface waters</strong> helped the cyclone rapidly intensify multiple times<ul>
<li>Usually, the sub-surface water is colder and when it gets pushed towards the surface due to mixing as a result of cyclonic winds, it creates conditions that don’t favour the intensification of cyclones</li>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: The Australian Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, announced an “Australia-India education qualification recognition mechanism” during a visit to India.</p>
<p><strong>What does it mean?</strong></p>
<p>This new mechanism means that <strong>degrees obtained in Australia (including online degrees) will now be recognised in India</strong>, and similarly, Indian degrees will be recognized by Australian colleges and authorities.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Significance</strong>: The agreement is expected to <strong>make it easier for Indians to go to Australia</strong> for both education and work, and vice-versa.</li>
<li><strong>Exceptions</strong>: Professional registrations of engineering, medicine and law graduates will remain outside the ambit of this agreement.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other similar agreement:</strong> India has other agreements with countries like the <strong>US</strong>, however, the agreement with the US doesn’t include online courses</p>
<p><strong>Other announcements:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Geelong’s Deakin University</strong> will be the first overseas university to open its branch campus in India (at GIFT City, Gandhi Nagar)</p>
<p><strong>‘Maitri’ scholarship</strong>: It will provide financial assistance to Indian students in Australia for as long <strong>as four years</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Astronomers using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) have discovered gaseous water in the planet-forming disc around the star V883 Orionis.</p>
<p><strong>Significance of the discovery:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The study confirms the idea that the <strong>water in planetary systems formed</strong> billions of years ago, before the Sun, in interstellar space, and has been inherited by both comets and Earth, relatively unchanged.</li>
<li>The discovery supports the idea that the <strong>water on earth is even older than the Sun</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How did the Earth get its water?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nearly 4 billion years ago</strong>, during the <strong>Late Heavy Bombardment</strong>, countless meteors rained down on the Earth and the Moon. Over time, these icy asteroids and comets delivered oceans to Earth, depositing the water directly to the surface.</p>
<p><strong>About ALMA telescope:</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA</strong>) is an international partnership of the EU, USA, Japan, Canada, Taiwan, Korea and Chile. It is a single telescope (located on the <strong>Chajnantor plateau, in northern Chile</strong>) with the aim of unravelling important astronomical mysteries, in search of our <strong>Cosmic Origins</strong></p>
