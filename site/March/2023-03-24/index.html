<h4 id="gs-paper-2"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Statutory, Regulatory and various Quasi-judicial Bodies</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/parliamentary-panel-recommends-new-law-to-define-power-functions-of-cbi/article66652681.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> According to a Parliamentary Committee, existing law governing the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/04/02/220937/">Central Bureau of Investigation</a> (CBI) has many limitations and there is a need to enact new legislation to define its status, functions and powers.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The CBI was established in <strong>1963</strong> (on the recommendation of the Santhanam Committee on Prevention of Corruption) and is governed by the <strong>Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) Act, 1946</strong>.</li>
<li>According to the DSPE Act, <strong>the consent of the State government is a prerequisite for any investigation by the CBI.</strong></li>
<li>As of date, <strong>9 States have withdrawn</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/10/23/general-consent-to-cbi/">the general consent</a> and the recommendation of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Personnel, Public Grievances, Law and Justice came amid these withdrawals.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Issues faced by the CBI:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A caged parrot:</strong> For instance, to prosecute any MLA/state minister, the CBI needs sanction from the Speaker of the state Assembly (for MLAs)/ the Governor (for state ministers).<ul>
<li>Since all these sanctioning authorities have links to the ruling dispensation, Opposition parties feel they are unfairly targeted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Structural constraints:</strong> Both the legal structure and the changes made in the Rules governing CBI have hindered the functioning of the CBI.</li>
<li><strong>Political tug-of-war:</strong> Increasingly hostile relations between the Centre and the state governments (usually ruled by opposition parties).</li>
<li><strong>Inadequate manpower:</strong> 1,709 posts are vacant against its sanctioned strength of 7,295 → increasing pendency of cases, hampering the quality of investigation → impacting the <strong>effectiveness and efficiency of the agency.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Opaqueness:</strong> The details of the cases and the annual report CBI is also not accessible to the general public.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Efforts to reform the institution:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In the landmark <strong>1997 Vineet Narain judgement</strong>, the SC fixed the tenure of the CBI Director at <strong>two years</strong> to secure the autonomy of the CBI.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/10/30/central-vigilance-commission/">Central Vigilance Commission</a> (CVC) – supervision powers over CBI – has been given <strong>statutory</strong> status (CVC Act, 2003).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/governance/governance-important-aspects/transparency/lokpal/">The Lokpal Act 2013</a>, laid down that the CBI Director should be chosen, unanimously or by majority vote, by a search committee headed by the PM (LoP, CJI as other members), from a Home Ministry-drawn list.</li>
<li>However, <strong>these reforms have been progressively diluted</strong> by various governments over the years.<ul>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> the DSPE Act has been amended (2021) to give the government the power to extend the term of CBI director by one year – diluting autonomy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations of the parliamentary committee:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A new law</strong> (also recommended by the 2nd ARC) to define the status, functions and powers of the CBI → safeguards to ensure <strong>objectivity and impartiality</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Fill up vacancies at the earliest. The CBI director should monitor</strong> the progress in this regard on a quarterly basis.</li>
<li><strong>Reduce dependence on deputations</strong> and strive to recruit <strong>permanent staff</strong> in the ranks of inspector of police and DSP.</li>
<li><strong>Details of cases should be available in the public domain</strong> → empower the citizens → make the functioning of CBI more accountable, responsible, efficient and transparent.<ul>
<li>For this, <strong>a case management system</strong> which would be a centralised database should be considered.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Prime Minister has unveiled a <strong>vision document for the rollout of 6G communications technology in India by 2030 titled Bharat 6G.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The vision document</strong> has been prepared by the <strong>Technology Innovation Group on 6G (TIG-6G) constituted by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT).</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>6G Vision is based on principles of <strong>Affordability, Sustainability, and Ubiquity</strong>.</li>
<li>The Vision is fully aligned with the <strong>national Vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat and will seek to empower every Indian to become Atmanirbhar (self-reliant) in their lives.</strong></li>

<p><strong>What is India’s 6G roadmap?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The 6G project will be <strong>implemented in two phases</strong>, and the government has also appointed an apex council to oversee the project and <strong>focus on issues such as standardisation, identification of the spectrum for 6G usage, create an ecosystem for devices and systems, and figure out finances for research and development etc.</strong></li>
<li>In phase one, <strong>support will be provided to explorative ideas, risky pathways and proof-of-concept test</strong></li>
<li>Ideas and <strong>concepts that show promise and potential for acceptance by the global peer community</strong> will be adequately supported to develop them to completion, establish their use cases and benefits, and <strong>create implementational IPs and testbeds leading to commercialisation as part of phase two.</strong></li>

<h4 id="gs-paper-3_2"><strong>GS Paper 3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Conservation, Environmental Pollution and Degradation, Environmental Impact Assessment</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/campa-fund-compensatory-afforestation-ipcc-synthesis-report/article66649373.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> India’s <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/06/unused-funds-unsuitable-land-the-problems-with-compensatory-afforestation-in-india/">compensatory afforestation</a> policy that allows forests in one part to be cut down and replaced with those elsewhere is contested on many grounds.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Afforestation is part of India’s climate pledges – <strong>adding a carbon sink of 2.5-3 GtCO2e through additional forest and tree cover by 2030</strong>.</li>
<li>According to <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/environment-degradation-and-issues/forest-ecosystem/forest-policy-and-laws-for-forest-conservation/the-forest-conservation-act-1980/#:~:text=Enacted%20to%20check%20the%20indiscriminate,prescribing%20the%20punishment%20for%20violations.&amp;text=Working%20plans%20should%20be%20up,have%20a%20multi%2Ddimensional%20approach.">the Forest (Conservation) Act 1980</a>, the project proponent that wishes to divert the land must identify land elsewhere to afforest and pay for the afforestation exercise.</li>
<li>Afforestation is also codified in the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/08/30/campa/">Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA)</a> – a body created on the SC’s orders in 2002 and chaired by the Union Environment Minister.</li>
<li>CAMPA is meant to <strong>promote afforestation and regeneration activities</strong> as a way of compensating for forest land diverted to non-forest uses (dam or mine).</li>
<li>It was made a legal requirement through the <strong>Compensatory Afforestation Fund (CAF) Act 2016.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why is afforestation contested?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>According to the Synthesis Report of the IPCC, the <strong>preservation of natural ecosystems</strong> rather than restoring the destroyed ones is being recognised as an important means to mitigate climate change.</li>
<li>According to the <strong>CAG report (2013),</strong> most of the money (~Rs 47,000 crore in 2019) in the CAMPA fund had been <strong>unspent</strong>.</li>
<li>CAMPA has also come under fire for <strong>facilitating the destruction of natural ecosystems</strong> → adversely impacting livelihood, biodiversity, hydrology and the climate.</li>
<li><strong>Planting non-native species</strong> or artificial plantations wouldn’t compensate for the ecosystem loss as well be hazardous to the existing ecosystem.</li>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> the Haryana govt is planning to develop the world’s largest curated safari using CAMPA funds received from deforestation in Great Nicobar.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance of the natural ecosystems:</strong> Provides biodiversity, local livelihoods, hydrological services and sequester carbon.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong> Renewable energy projects like <strong>wind and solar plants</strong> must be promoted to mitigate the adverse impacts of natural ecosystem diversion.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges for India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Many solar parks in India have <strong>triggered conflicts with people living nearby</strong>.</li>
<li>Wind farms in the Western Ghats had <strong>reduced the abundance and activity of predatory birds</strong>, which consequently increased the density of lizards.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Climate actions</strong>, such as technologies to combat climate change, renewable energy farms, etc. <strong>should not come at the cost of natural ecosystems.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Not degrading existing ecosystems in the first place</strong> will do more to lower the impact of the climate crisis than restoring ecosystems that have been destroyed.</li>

<h3 id="story-on-happiness"><strong>Story on Happiness</strong></h3>
<p><strong>A sage named Narada</strong> travels to find the happiest person in the world but fails to find one until he meets a poor farmer who is always content and happy despite his poverty.</p>
<p><strong>Narada</strong> asked him to teach him how to be happy like him. The farmer then gave Narada a <strong>small bag of rice</strong> and told him to carry it on his back and walk around the village. Narada was confused but followed the farmer’s instructions. But the more he walked, the <strong>heavier the bag of rice became.</strong> Narada soon realized that the bag was becoming a burden, and he was starting to feel tired and unhappy. He went back to the farmer and told him about his experience. The farmer smiled and said, “<strong>Happiness is not about what you have or what you do. It’s about how you carry your burdens</strong>.”</p>
<p>Narada understood the lesson and <strong>realized that happiness is not something that can be found outside of oneself.</strong> It comes from <strong>within, from having faith, gratitude, and contentment, no matter</strong> what one’s circumstances may be.</p>
<p><strong>Usage</strong>: The example can be used in Essay paper on themes related to Happiness</p>

<li>Within that period, the convicted lawmaker could have filed an appeal against the sentence before a higher court.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>However, this provision was struck down as “<strong>unconstitutional</strong>” in the SC’s landmark <strong>2013</strong> ruling in ‘<strong>Lily Thomas v Union of India</strong>’.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Options available after conviction:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Get his conviction stayed by a higher court.</li>
<li>Approaching the President. As per <strong>Article 103</strong> of the Constitution, the disqualification case of an MP will be decided by the President in consultation with the Election Commission.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> India rejects Johnson &amp; Johnson’s attempt to extend monopoly on lifesaving TB drug – Bedaquiline.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bedaquiline</strong> is a crucial drug in the treatment of <strong>multi-drug resistant TB patients</strong> for whom the first-line drug treatment (Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol) has stopped working.</li>
<li>Over 55,000 patients benefited from access to Bedaquiline in India in 2019.</li>
<li>When J&amp;J filed for evergreening of its patent on fumarate salt (a formulation of Bedaquiline), its patent evergreening practice was challenged by two TB survivors in 2019.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why is Patent Monopoly/Evergreening?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is a practice of <strong>modifying drugs</strong> (without improving efficacy) in order to extend their patent life and profitability.</li>
<li>Evergreening → establishes monopoly → undermines competition.</li>
<li><strong>The Indian Patents Act, 1970</strong> prohibits the mischievous practice of evergreening of patents → making the drugs <strong>affordable</strong> and promoting domestic <strong>generic drug markers</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Indian Patent Office’s order in the J&amp;J case:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The claimed invention is not patentable since it was obvious and <strong>lacked an innovative step</strong> mandated under Section 3(e) of the Patents Act.</li>
<li>According to Patents Act Section 3(d), <strong>derivatives of well-known compounds and salt forms are not patentable.</strong></li>
