<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Social justice (Issues related to women)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/womens-reservation-bill-8489481/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) leader K Kavitha began a day-long hunger strike in New Delhi, demanding passage of the Women’s Reservation Bill (WRB).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/issues-related-to-women/women-in-indian-political-system/way-forward/">Women’s Reservation Bill</a> <strong>(WRB)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Bill will reserve <strong>one-third of the total number of seats</strong> in state Assemblies and Parliament for women.</li>
<li>It was first introduced in <strong>1996</strong> and was referred to a <strong>Joint Parliamentary Committee</strong> (chaired by Geeta Mukherjee), which recommended –<ul>
<li>Reservation for a period of 15 years;</li>
<li>Including reservation in cases where the state has less than three seats in LS;</li>
<li>Including reservation for the Delhi assembly; and</li>
<li>Changing “not less than one-third” to “as nearly as may be, one-third”, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Two recommendations, which became <strong>major sticking points</strong> –<ul>
<li>Regarding reservation for OBC women (quota within a quota)</li>
<li>Reservation for women in the Rajya Sabha and legislative council</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Constitution (<strong>108th Amendment</strong>) Bill, 2008, was introduced in Parliament.</li>
<li>The last attempt was made in <strong>2010</strong> when the WBR Bill was <strong>passed in the</strong> <strong>RS but the LS never voted on it</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/WRB.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/WRB.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>The demand for reservation for women in legislative bodies:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is seen as <strong>a logical extension of the 72nd and</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/functions-and-responsibilities-of-the-union-and-the-states-issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure-devolution-of-powers-and-finances-up-to-local-levels-and-challenges-therein/devolution-of-powers-and-finances-up-to-local-levels-and-challenges-therein/73rd-amendment-act-panchayati-raj/">73rd constitutional amendments</a> (1992,1993), which reserved one-third of all seats and chairperson posts for women in rural and urban local governments.</li>
<li>However, there has <strong>never been a political consensus</strong> on the issue.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Women in Parliament: India and the rest of the world:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Just <strong>14%</strong> of 17th LS MPs are women (<strong>78</strong> in total). Women make up roughly <strong>11%</strong> of the RS.</li>
<li>While the number has <strong>increased significantly since the 1st LS</strong> (5%), it is still far lower than in many countries.</li>
<li>According to PRS data, <strong>Rwanda (61%), South Africa (43%), and even Bangladesh (21%)</strong> are ahead of India.</li>
<li>According to the Inter-Parliamentary Union’s latest report, India ranks <strong>144 out of 193 countries</strong> in the representation of women in Parliament.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Need for greater representation for women in legislative bodies:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Until consensus is reached on the Women’s Reservation Bill alternate methods such as reservation in political parties, and increasing women voters’ turnout, must be undertaken.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Sri Lankan President announced that the country had cleared the last hurdles to be approved for a $2.9 billion bailout from the IMF.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> The country has been reeling from the <strong>covid crisis, economic mismanagement</strong> by the Rajapakse regime, <strong>mounting debts</strong> → soaring inflation → GDP/ Exports collapse → Currency collapse.</p>
<p><strong>What the IMF bailout would mean for Sri Lanka?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Brings a lot of <strong>creditworthiness</strong> to the entire system and <strong>confidence</strong>.</li>
<li>A lot of other agencies like the <strong>World Bank, AIIB, and ADB</strong>, have lined up funds to come in.</li>
<li>Debt becomes more sustainable → access to the capital market → stabilizing the economy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How India supported its neighbor?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Contrary to <strong>China</strong>, India’s support has come unconditionally, and more promptly.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/international-relations/india-and-its-neighborhood/india-sri-lanka-relations/">India’s support to Sri Lanka</a> (worth a combined $4 bn) includes –<ul>
<li>Shipments of grain, fuel, essentials, medicines</li>
<li>Credit lines</li>
<li>Debt repayment relief</li>
<li>Support at the IMF to work on the bailout package</li>
<li>Support at the G20 and BIMSTEC</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How did Sri Lanka respond to India’s support?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>“India had really come to our rescue, <strong>India had provided us with a lifeline</strong> which allowed us to stay afloat during a very difficult time,” Minister of Foreign Affairs of Sri Lanka.</li>
<li>In a speech on Women’s day, Sri Lankan President <strong>thanked 3 women</strong> – Nirmala Sitharaman, Janet Yellen, and Kristalina Georgieva for helping Sri Lanka.</li>
<li>Sri Lanka is looking for <strong>more investments from India</strong> in IT, pharmaceuticals, the energy sector, education, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>For India:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>The controversy over Adani projects in Sri Lanka</strong> (2 wind power plants in Mannar and Pooneryn areas of [northern] Sri Lanka, West Container Terminal at Colombo Port, etc).</li>
<li>The opposition had raised issues over the manner of choosing the company.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>For Sri Lanka:</strong> How can Sri Lanka balance its ties with China and India?<ul>
<li>Sri Lanka has been <strong>a very close friend of India</strong> and doesn’t want to hurt I<strong>ndia’s security concerns</strong>.</li>
<li>Despite all the problems China is also India’s biggest [trading] partner.</li>
<li>Similarly, Sri Lanka also <strong>wants to work with Indians and the Chinese, and the rest.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Sri Lankan crisis and reversal is a good example for the region – it is about being more sensitive to a neighbor’s needs rather than outspending rivals.</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: According to the latest <strong>Findex Report – 2021 by the World Bank</strong>, around <strong>one-third of adults still lack access to formal financial services.</strong></p>
<p><strong>About financial inclusion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Financial inclusion means that <strong>individuals and businesses have access to useful and affordable financial products and services that meet their needs</strong> – transactions, payments, savings, credit, and insurance – delivered in a responsible and sustainable way.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Importance of financial inclusion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Financial inclusion has been <strong>identified as an enabler for 7 of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.</strong>  </li>
<li>The G20 committed to advancing financial inclusion worldwide and reaffirmed its commitment to <strong>implement the G20 High-Level Principles for Digital Financial Inclusion.</strong> </li>
<li>The World Bank Group considers <strong>financial inclusion a key enabler to reduce extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity.</strong></li>
<li>Financial inclusion has been linked to up to <strong>14% growth in the gross domestic product in developing economies.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges in achieving financial inclusion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of access to basic infrastructure</strong></li>
<li><strong>Low financial literacy</strong></li>
<li><strong>Limited trust in formal financial institutions</strong></li>
<li><strong>Insufficient regulatory framework</strong></li>
<li><strong>High transaction costs</strong></li>
<li><strong>Lack of diversity in financial services</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How India’s G-20 presidency helps in improving financial inclusion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The theme of India’s G20 Presidency, “<strong>Vasudhaiv Kutumbakam</strong>,” underlines the message of <strong>equitable growth and a shared future for all.</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>G20 Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion</strong> working group met under the grouping’s <strong>Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion (GPFI) initiative.</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>G20 Financial Inclusion Action Plan (FIAP)</strong>aims to prevent future economic crises by encouraging conditions that promote its objectives of financial inclusion and stability.</li>
<li><strong>Four major drivers have been highlighted in the new G20 FIAP</strong> to lay the groundwork for further <strong>progress toward financial inclusion.</strong><ul>
<li>the <strong>acceptance of the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development as a worldwide framework for sustainable development</strong></li>
<li>rapid <strong>development and penetration of digital breakthroughs</strong>,</li>
<li>greater emphasis on underprivileged populations,</li>
<li><strong>mainstreaming financial inclusion</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Financial Inclusion Schemes in India</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY)</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Finance Ministry has amended the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/08/02/editorial-analysis-by-upholding-pmla-sc-puts-its-stamp-on-kafkas-law/">Prevention of Money Laundering Act</a> (PMLA) and rules in line with the recommendations of the FATF – the global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The government has been struggling to deal with the pandemic-era upsurge in advertisements soliciting <strong>investment in virtual assets.</strong></li>
<li>A 2021 report estimated <strong>India with the highest number of ‘crypto owners’</strong> (10.07 crore), more than threefold than the 2nd-ranked U.S.</li>
<li>ED was investigating several cases related to <strong>cryptocurrency frauds</strong> wherein crypto exchanges were involved in <strong>money laundering</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why these amendments?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To <strong>incorporate more disclosures for NGOs</strong> by reporting entities like financial institutions (FIs), banking companies, or intermediaries.</li>
<li>To define <strong>“politically exposed persons”</strong> (PEPs).</li>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: Scientists have called for a legally binding treaty to ensure <strong>Earth’s orbit isn’t irreparably harmed by the future expansion of the global space industry.</strong></p>
<p><strong>About</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/01/21/space-debris-3/#:~:text=The%20real%20amount%20of%20space,a%20satellite%20or%20a%20spacecraft."><strong>Space debris</strong></a><strong>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Space debris includes <strong>non-functional spacecraft, abandoned launch vehicle stages, mission-related debris, and fragmentation debris.</strong></li>
<li>Space debris can also be <strong>generated when two satellites collide</strong>, releasing thousands of new pieces.</li>
<li><strong>Anti-satellite tests also result in debris.</strong> In 2019, India tested an anti-satellite missile targeting a satellite in Low Earth Orbit (LEO).</li>
<li>Space debris could <strong>trigger a chain reaction, where too many objects collide with each other and create new space junk in the process</strong> (known as Kessler Syndrome)</li>
<li>Space debris encompasses <strong>both natural (meteoroid) and artificial (man-made) particles.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Present scenario to protect Earth’s orbit:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Companies are not incentivized to clean up orbits or to include de-orbiting functions in satellites</strong>.</li>
<li>De-orbiting means <strong>bringing dead satellites back to Earth</strong>.</li>
<li>There is <strong>no international treaty that seeks to minimize orbital debris</strong>. But the <strong>United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space has laid out guidelines to mitigate space debris.</strong></li>
<li>Operators are expected to <strong>clear the orbit within 25 years after the satellite’s mission ends.</strong> Still, most <strong>states have neglected to implement the necessary local space regulations, according to the letter.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way forward:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Any agreement should include measures to <strong>implement producer and user responsibility for satellites and debri</strong>s, from the time they launch onward.</li>
<li>Minimizing the pollution of the lower Earth <strong>orbit will allow continued space exploration, satellite continuity, and the growth of life-changing space technology</strong>.</li>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: For the first time the <strong>Indian Space Research Organisation</strong> brought down a satellite in a <strong>controlled manner after its end of life.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The weather satellite <strong>Megha Tropiques-1,</strong> which was developed as a <strong>joint mission by Indian and French space agencies</strong>, entered the atmosphere after the final two maneuvers and burnt up over the Pacific Ocean.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How was the satellite brought down?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Megha Tropiques satellite was launched <strong>aboard a PSLV by the space agency in 2011.</strong></li>
<li>Although the <strong>planned mission life of the satellite was only three years, it continued providing data on the water cycle and energy exchanges i</strong>n the tropics for nearly a decade.</li>
<li>As some fuel was left – <strong>it was maneuvered and brought back to earth.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Usually, satellites are <strong>left in their orbit and because of the gravitational pull of the earth, they come down to the atmosphere over years and years</strong>. When the satellites re-enter the atmosphere, the <strong>friction causes them to heat up to extremely high temperatures of thousands of degrees Celsius.</strong> Without a heat shield, 99% of a satellite gets burnt up whether in a controlled re-entry or an uncontrolled one.</p>

<h3 id="safe-harbor-clause-in-it-law"><strong>‘Safe harbor’ clause in IT law</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/digital-india-bill-new-law-internet-explained-8488748/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The government is reconsidering a key aspect of cyberspace – <strong>‘safe harbor’</strong>, which is the principle that allows social media platforms to avoid liability for posts made by users.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Union government formally outlined <strong>the Digital India Bill, 2023</strong> which is a broad overhaul of the decades-old IT Act, 2000.</li>
<li>This Safe harbor has been reined in the <strong>IT (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is a ‘safe harbor’?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Safe harbor (originally from the <strong>US’s Communications Decency Act</strong>) – as prescribed under <strong>Section 79 of the IT Act, 2000</strong> – is <strong>legal immunity</strong> that online intermediaries enjoy against content posted by users on their platforms.</li>
<li>This is available as long as these platforms <strong>abide by certain due diligence requirements</strong>, such as censoring content when asked by the government or courts.</li>
<li>It is a crucial tenet for <strong>ensuring free speech on the Internet</strong> since platforms only have to act on speech that is deemed illegal.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Then, why revisit the norm?</strong></p>
<p>Intermediaries were synonymous with the safe harbor in the 2000s, but they have since <strong>evolved into a variety of internet participants</strong> with very varied functional needs.</p>
<p><strong>The core objectives of the new Digital India Bill:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To ensure an open and safe Internet in the country to ensure users’ rights and reduce risks for them online; <strong>accelerate the growth of technology innovation.</strong></li>
<li>It will also <strong>regulate a range of crimes</strong> that the government thinks are unique to the online space.</li>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: India will soon have a modern and smart power transmission system.</p>
<ul>
<li>The recommendations of a task force (2021) have been accepted by the Power Ministry.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are transmission Networks?</strong></p>
<p>Electric power transmission is the bulk movement of electrical energy from a generating site, such as a power plant, to an electrical substation. The interconnected lines that facilitate this movement form a transmission network.</p>
<p><strong>Issues with the transmission network:</strong> India faces high aggregate technical and commercial losses (AT&amp;C) <strong>(around 17%, China’s is low at 5%),</strong> which causes power shortages for consumers. Additionally, low tariffs and cross-subsidization lead to a significant difference between the average cost of supply and the average revenue generated.</p>
<p><strong>The features of smart power transmission will include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Real-time monitoring</strong> and automated operation of the grid</li>
<li><strong>Operation of Substations</strong> by using modern systems like SCADA, Flexible AC Transmission devices (FACTs)</li>
<li><strong>Predictive maintenance</strong> using AI/ML algorithms</li>
<li><strong>Use of Robots &amp; Drones</strong> in the construction and inspection of transmission assets</li>
<li><strong>Better situational assessment</strong></li>
<li>Capability to have an <strong>increased share of renewable capacity</strong> in the power-mix</li>
<li>Greater resilience <strong>against cyber-attacks</strong> as well as natural disasters</li>
<li><strong>Centralized and data</strong>-driven decision-making</li>
<li><strong>Reduction in forced outages</strong> through self-correcting systems</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance</strong>: It will reduce operations and management costs for utilities and ultimately lower power costs for consumers. It will help meet the government’s vision of providing 24×7 reliable and affordable power and meeting sustainability goals.</p>
<p><strong>Central Electricity Authority</strong> (CEA, a <strong>statutory</strong> body under the Ministry of Power) will formulate standards and guidelines as per the recommendation.</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: Researchers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), have found that <strong>grazing by livestock leads to lower carbon storage in soil compared to grazing by wild herbivores.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Researchers found that this <strong>difference appears to be due to the use of veterinary antibiotics such as tetracycline on livestock.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>More about the study:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The researchers said that when released into the soil through dung and urine<strong>, these antibiotics alter the microbial communities in the soil in ways that are detrimental to sequestering carbon.</strong></li>
<li>The study states that although soils from the wild and livestock areas had many similarities, they differed in one key parameter called <strong>carbon use efficiency (CUE), which determines the ability of microbes to store carbon in the soil. The soil in the livestock areas had 19% lower CUE.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Tetracycline:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Antibiotics such as <strong>tetracycline are long-lived and can linger in the soil for decades</strong>.</li>
<li>Its use in <strong>cats, dogs, small mammals, horses, or birds to treat bacterial infections or other conditions is ‘off label’ or ‘extra label’</strong>.</li>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: Russia unleashed its biggest aerial strike against Ukraine, hitting critical infrastructure. Among a varied range of powerful missiles launched by Moscow, <strong>there were six hypersonic missiles, known as Kinzhals, or Daggers.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is a hypersonic missile?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A hypersonic missile, such as Kinzhal, is <strong>capable of flying at least at the speed of Mach 5, i.e. five times the speed of sound, and is maneuverable</strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong>maneuverability of the hypersonic missile is what differentiates it from a ballistic missile</strong>, as the latter follows a set course or a ballistic trajectory.</li>
<li>This makes <strong>them extremely lethal because, by the time they are detected by ground-based radars, they are already quite near to their target.</strong></li>
<li>There are <strong>two types of hypersonic weapons systems</strong>: Hypersonic Glide Vehicles (HGV) and Hypersonic Cruise Missiles. The HGVs are fired from a rocket before gliding to the intended target while the hypersonic cruise missile is powered by air-breathing high-speed engines or ‘scramjets’ after acquiring their target.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/hypeoni.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/hypeoni.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>About Kinzhal:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Kinzhal, is capable of <strong>reaching speeds of Mach 10 and greater</strong>, with a range of about 1,250 miles. The missile is also <strong>believed to be nuclear-capable and is usually launched by MiG-31 warplanes.</strong></li>
<li>Apart from Kinzal, Moscow reportedly has two other types of hypersonic missile systems. <strong>One is the Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle, which can fly at speeds as high as Mach 27. And the other is the Zircon anti-ship missile</strong>.</li>

<p><strong>Foster’s Rule (or Island Effect)</strong> is a rule in evolutionary biology describing how large-bodied species tend to downsize on islands while small-bodied species upsize.</p>
<ul>
<li>Members of a species get smaller or bigger depending on the resources available in the environment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: A dwarf elephant the size of a Shetland pony once roamed the Mediterranean island of Cyprus. In the West Indies, a giant <strong>rat-like rodent tipped</strong> the scales at more than 400 pounds (180 kg), rivaling an American black bear.</p>
<p>A new study has found that the <strong>arrival of people on the islands raised extinction rates more than tenfold.</strong></p>
<p>Islands account for up to <strong>20% of land species and are biodiversity hotspots</strong>, but they are under threat from hunting, habitat destruction, and the introduction of diseases and invasive predators by humans.</p>
