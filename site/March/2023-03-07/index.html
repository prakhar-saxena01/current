<h4 id="gs-paper-1"><strong>GS Paper 1</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus: Geography- Geophysical phenomenon.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/all-12-districts-prone-to-landslides-isro-study-485645"><strong>The Tribune</strong></a><strong>,</strong> <a href="https://www.nrsc.gov.in/sites/default/files/pdf/Announcements/Landslide%20Atlas_2023.pdf"><strong>NRSC</strong></a> <strong>(Data given in the article is taken from this report)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> All 12 districts of Himachal Pradesh have <strong>figured on a list prepared by the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC</strong>) of locations prone <strong>to landslides.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Landslide Atlas</strong> of India was released by <strong>Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO</strong>) at the “<strong>National Meet on Disaster Risk Management — Trends &amp; Technologies</strong>” held at Hyderabad.</li>
<li>The <strong>NRSC, one of the centres of ISRO, manages data from aerial and satellite sources.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Landslide:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A landslide is <strong>“a movement of a mass of rock, earth or debris down a slope”.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/falls.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/falls.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Types of flows</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Debris flows</strong>: It is a form of rapid mass movement in which a combination of loose soil, rock, organic matter, and slurry that flows downslope. They are commonly caused by intense precipitation or rapid snowmelt.</li>
<li><strong>Earth flow:</strong> It is a down-slope viscous flow of fine-grained material saturated with water.</li>
<li><strong>Mudflow:</strong> A mudflow is a wet or viscous fluid mass of fine and coarse-grained material that flows rapidly along drainage channels.</li>
<li><strong>Creep:</strong> Creep is the <strong>slow, steady, downward movement of material</strong> under gravity that occurs in a large area</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>India is among the <strong>top four countries with the highest landslide risk</strong>, where every year the estimated loss of <strong>life per 100 km2 is greater than one.</strong></li>
<li>This Atlas provides risk assessment in <strong>landslide locations during the period of 1998-2022 and covers vulnerable regions in 17 states and 02 UTs of India</strong> in the Himalayas and Western Ghats.</li>
<li>Northwest <strong>Himalayas contribute 66.5% of landslides in India</strong>, followed by Northeast Himalayas (<strong>18.8%) and</strong> <strong>Western Ghats (14.7%).</strong></li>
<li>Top 5 districts based on their exposure to landslide<strong>: Rudraprayag and Tehri Garhwal (Uttarakhand), Thrissur (Kerala), Rajouri (J&amp;K), and Palakkad (Kerala)</strong></li>
<li>The database includes three types of landslide inventory – <strong>seasonal, event-based and route-wise</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About NRSC:</strong></p>
<p>National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) has the <strong>mandate for the establishment of ground stations for receiving satellite data, generation of data products, dissemination to the users, development of techniques for remote sensing applications including disaster management support</strong>, geospatial services for good governance and capacity building for professionals, faculty, and students.</p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-1_1"><strong>GS Paper 1</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Important Geophysical phenomena</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/even-with-moderate-emissions-indias-heat-is-set-to-get-worse/article66583449.ece#:~:text=Climate%20projections%20for%20the%20districts,a%20'moderate%20emissions'%20scenario."><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The climate crisis is no longer a distant event that might happen in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Indications of the impending climate crisis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Temperatures are rising, rainfall patterns are shifting, and <strong>extreme events such as record-high temperatures</strong>, etc.</li>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> the month of February (this year) in India was the hottest since 1901.</li>
<li>According to a 2021 study (The Lancet), <strong>more than five million people died</strong> (between 2000-2019) on average each year worldwide because of extreme temperatures.</li>
<li><strong>The IPCC 6th Assessment Report</strong> states that <strong>extreme heat events will grow</strong> with increasing global warming.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The case of India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A study shows that the temperature in India has been <strong>steadily increasing during both summer and winter.</strong></li>
<li>The recorded increase in maximum and minimum temperature over 30 years (1990-2019) is up to <strong>0.</strong><strong>9º C and 0.5º</strong> <strong>C</strong>, respectively.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/trends1.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/trends1.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Impact of increasing heat:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A cause of suffering and <strong>death</strong> in extreme cases.</li>
<li>It undermines systems such as <strong>agriculture and other climate-sensitive sectors</strong> that support the livelihoods and well-being of people.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Climate projections for the districts of India (2021-2050):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The summer maximum temperature will increase</strong> (between 2º C – 3.5º C) even under a ‘moderate emissions’ scenario.</li>
<li><strong>Even winter minimum temperatures are projected to increase</strong> by 0.5º C to 3.5º C in the future.</li>
<li><strong>The diurnal temperature range</strong> (DTR – variation between high and low air temperature during a single day) is also changing.<ul>
<li>A Department of Science and Technology study (2020) shows <strong>an asymmetric increase in the minimum temperature</strong> compared to the maximum.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This will, in turn, increase the risk of <strong>heat stress</strong> → drought, deteriorating soil quality, crop failure, job loss, higher migration, morbidity, and mortality → can affect ecological systems, and the carbon economy.</li>
<li>According to a 2019 ILO report, India is expected <strong>to lose 5.8% of working hours in 2030 due to heat stress.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Implement the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/03/19/united-nations-office-for-disaster-risk-reduction-unisdr/"><strong>Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction</strong></a> through improved <strong>early warning systems, public awareness, and formulation of heat action plans.</strong></li>
<li>Prepare <strong>district-level heat hotspot maps</strong> to design long-term measures to reduce deaths due to extreme heat.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best practices: Innovative strategies</strong> such as –</p>
<ul>
<li>Emergency cooling centres (similar to the ones in Toronto and Paris);</li>
<li><strong>Survival guides</strong> that are strategically displayed to survive extreme heat or heat waves (like in Athens);</li>
<li><strong>White roofs</strong> (Los Angeles);</li>
<li>Green rooftops (Rotterdam);</li>
<li>Self-shading tower blocks (Abu Dhabi); and</li>
<li>Green corridors (Medellin).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The PM of India called for preparing <strong>separate awareness material for different stakeholders</strong> like common citizens, medical professionals, local body authorities, and disaster response teams.</p>
<p><strong>PM asked:</strong></p>
<p>●        The FCI is to take measures to ensure optimal storage of grains in extreme weather conditions.</p>
<p>●        The IMD prepares <strong>daily weather forecasts</strong> which makes predictions easy to interpret and disseminate.</p>
<p>●        For detailed fire audits of all hospitals.</p>
<p><strong>Heat Wave:</strong></p>
<p>●        A heat wave is a period of <strong>abnormally high temperatures</strong>, more than the normal maximum temperature that occurs during the summer season in the NW parts of India.</p>
<p>●        Heat waves <strong>typically occur between March and June</strong>.</p>
<p>●        According to the IMD, heat waves need not be considered till the maximum temperature of a station reaches <strong>at least 40°C for Plains and at least 30°C for Hilly regions.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Five years ago, the sale window for the first tranche of Electoral Bonds was opened in March 2018.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction of Electoral bonds:</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/electrol_bond_1-1-e1668078212541.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/electrol_bond_1-1-e1668078212541.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Electoral Bond Scheme (EBS), announced in the 2017 Union Budget, was notified by the Central Government in <strong>2018</strong>.</li>
<li>These bonds <strong>can be purchased from select SBI branches</strong> by any Indian person or corporation incorporated in India.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Performance of EBS:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ond_sale.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ond_sale.jpg?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Concerns related to the operation of EBS:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Introduce a new type of anonymity by –</strong><ul>
<li>Reducing public and legislative oversight. <strong>For example</strong>, only the ruling party via the SBI has a full account of all donations.</li>
<li><strong>Political parties do not disclose electoral bond donors.</strong> The only requirement is the annual audit reports with all donations received via electoral bonds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Impact of anonymity:</strong> Dilutes one voter-one vote principle, an undue advantage to the ruling party, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In 2021, the SC refused to stay the sale of electoral bonds and <strong>suggested bringing in more transparency.</strong></li>
<li>The information regarding donors and donations <strong>should be accessible to the Parliament, the Election Commission of India and the Opposition via SBI.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The RTI must be strengthened</strong>.</li>
<li>Ex-CEC (OP Rawat) suggests that the political funding scheme could be improved by appointing an “<strong>independent watchdog</strong>”.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best practice:</strong> Jharkhand Mukti Morcha recently disclosed the identities of EB donors – the first political party to do so</p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-3"><strong>GS Paper 3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Infrastructure (Energy)/Conservation, environmental pollution and degradation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/how-to-become-a-green-hydrogen-superpower/article66587070.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The 2023 Union Budget has allocated ₹19,700 crore for the <strong>National Green Hydrogen Mission.</strong> This could help India establish itself as a green H2 superpower.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GH2.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GH2.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Importance of Green H2 for India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>India has committed to <strong>50% electricity capacity from non-fossil sources by 2030</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>An energy transition in the industry</strong> (most GHG emissions come from steel, cement, fertilizers, and petrochemicals) is needed at the same time.</li>
<li>Green H2 can serve as an <strong>energy source</strong> (heavy industry, mobility, and power storage) and an <strong>energy carrier</strong> (as green ammonia/blended with natural gas).<ul>
<li>It holds the promise of <strong>fuelling industrial growth while simultaneously reducing industrial emissions</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>With abundant sunshine and wind energy resources, <strong>India is geographically blessed</strong> to become one of the lowest-cost producers of green H2.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Priorities to convert the vision into reality:</strong> Government and industry must act in sync for –</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Becoming a big player domestically</strong> – a necessity to be a major player in the international market.<ul>
<li>The mission introduces a <strong>Strategic Interventions for Green Hydrogen Transition</strong> (<strong>SIGHT</strong>) fund (₹13,000 crores) to support heavy industries to increase demand, offering economies of scale, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Blending mandates for refineries</strong> can be another demand trigger.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As the second-largest steel producer in the world, <strong>India can aspire to become the largest green steel producer</strong>.<ul>
<li>Costs of green steel, made from green H2, could be reduced with e<strong>conomies of scale and changes in production technologies.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>India can be <strong>an attractive destination for domestic and foreign investment</strong>.<ul>
<li>A mission secretariat can ensure project clearance is streamlined and reduce financial risks.</li>

<h3 id="global-greenhouse-gas-monitoring-infrastructure-gggmi"><strong>Global Greenhouse Gas Monitoring Infrastructure (GGGMI)</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/un-takes-step-towards-new-way-of-tracking-greenhouse-gases/article66587986.ece"><strong>The Hindu</strong></a> </p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The <strong>U.N.’s World Meteorological Organization</strong> has come up with <strong>a new Global Greenhouse Gas Monitoring Infrastructure</strong> that aims to provide better ways of <strong>measuring planet-warming pollution and help inform policy choices.</strong></p>
<p><strong>About the GGGMI:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Need:</strong> The current global greenhouse gas (GHG) monitoring relies <strong>heavily on research funding and capabilities,</strong> which makes sustained monitoring challenging.<ul>
<li>The three major greenhouse gases are <strong>carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. Of those, CO2 accounts for around 66% of the warming effect on the climate.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Working</strong> The GGGMI will engage with the broader scientific community and other UN agencies involved in GHG monitoring activities.</li>
<li><strong>Benefit</strong>: The infrastructure will improve our understanding of the carbon cycle and provide critical and timely input to the UNFCCC processes.<ul>
<li>It will help humans understand climate change and to provide support to mitigation action taken by the Parties to the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The increase in <strong>CO2 levels from 2020 to 2021 was higher than the average growth rate over the past decade,</strong> and methane saw the biggest year-on-year jump since measurements.</p>
<p>The 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change saw countries agree to cap global warming at <strong>“well below” two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above levels measured between 1850 and 1900 – and 1.5C if possible.</strong></p>
<p><strong>About WMO:</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>World Meteorological Organization (est. 1950; HQ: Geneva)</strong> is a <strong>specialized agency</strong> of the United Nations responsible for promoting international cooperation on atmospheric science, climatology, hydrology and geophysics</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Researchers at <strong>Paderborn University, Germany</strong> have reported being able to make a <strong>unique class of catalysts</strong> – used in chemistry to accelerate reactions – <strong>called “Lewis super-acids</strong>”</p>
<ul>
<li>These can be used to <strong>break strong chemical bonds and speed up reactions.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are Lewis Acids and Bases?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A Lewis acid is any substance, suc<strong>h as a Hydrogen ion (H+) that can accept a pair of nonbonding electrons.</strong> In other words, a <strong>Lewis acid is an electron-pair acceptor.</strong></li>
<li>A Lewis base is any substance, <strong>such as the OH- ion, that can donate a pair of nonbonding electrons. A Lewis base is therefore an electron-pair donor.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Applicability:</strong></p>
<p>Being able to make these super acids, <strong>enables non-biodegradable fluorinated hydrocarbons,</strong> similar to <strong>Teflon, and possibly even climate-damaging greenhouse gases, such as Sulphur hexafluoride, to</strong> be <strong>converted back into sustainable chemicals</strong>.</p>

<li>Pigeons may lead to various kinds of lung diseases, ranging from respiratory allergies to serious infections.</li>
<li>Severe cases may lead to <strong>Pneumonia-Psittacosis</strong>, which is a bacterial infection</li>
<li><strong>Hypersensitive pneumonia</strong> (a lung disease which is contracted by living near pigeons) (also known as Pigeon Breeder’s Disease)</li>
<li><strong>Histoplasmosis</strong> (fungal infection with high mortality rates)</li>
<li><strong>Cryptococcal infections</strong> (it may lead to pulmonary or meningeal infections)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mode of transmission:</strong> The breathable antigen arising from the bird droppings and feathers goes into the lung and leads to an immunological reaction, which damages the lung.</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: India has proposed to launch a mega global alliance under its leadership to protect big cats and assured support over five years with <strong>guaranteed funding of $100 million</strong></p>
<p><strong>About IBCA</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aim</strong>:<ul>
<li>Protection and conservation of the <strong>seven major big cats — tiger, lion, leopard, snow leopard, puma, jaguar and cheetah</strong>.</li>
<li>To <strong>provide a platform for</strong> “dissemination of information on benchmarked practices, capacity building, resources repository, research and development, awareness creation”, etc., on the protection and conservation of big cats.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Governance structure</strong>:<ul>
<li><strong>General Assembly</strong> (consisting of all member countries)</li>
<li><strong>A council</strong> (seven to 15 member countries elected by the General Assembly for a term of 5 years)</li>
<li><strong>A Secretariat</strong> (headed by IBCA Secretary General for a specific term)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Funding</strong>: 1st five years will be supported by India’s “total grant assistance” of $100 million.<ul>
<li>After that IBCA is expected to sustain itself through membership fees, and contributions from bilateral and multilateral institutions and the private sector. However, the proposed move has invited criticism, too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Membership</strong>: It will be open to 97 “range” countries, which contain the natural habitat of these big cats, as well as other interested nations, international organisations, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>India is the <strong>only country in the world</strong> to have tigers, lions, leopards, snow leopards and cheetahs in the wild. India has all the big cats, except <strong>the pumas and jaguars</strong>, today.</p>
