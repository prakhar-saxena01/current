<p><strong>Context:</strong>  The Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry is currently <strong>evaluating 26 proposals from 21 states</strong> for the creation of new cities in India.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations for new cities:</strong></p>
<p><strong>15th Finance Commission</strong> recommended <strong>Rs 8,000 crore for the incubation of eight new cities</strong>  (Rs 1000 cr to each) in the country through a challenge.</p>
<p><strong>Criteria:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A state can have <strong>only one new city</strong> through this fund.</li>
<li><strong>A maximum of nine new cities</strong> in nine states can be selected</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The proposal received</strong> for new cities or expansion of existing ones are Gurgaon (Haryana), Jabalpur Extension (Madhya Pradesh), Ayodhya (Uttar Pradesh), GIFT City Expansion (Gujarat), Nagaki Global City (Nagaland), New MOPA Ayush City (Goa), and Bantala Greenfield City (West Bengal)</p>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/healthcare-in-india-has-made-great-progress-but-challenges-remain-8524485/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> India will continue to have the world’s youngest population for more than three decades, but to fully capitalise on this advantage there is the need to overcome certain difficult health issues.</p>
<p><strong>Some recent achievements in the health sector:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NFHS-5:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Total fertility rate (TFR):</strong> India achieved a TFR of 2.1 (replacement level) in 2020.</li>
<li><strong>Maternal and infant mortality:</strong> Even in the BIMARU states, hospital deliveries have soared to 89%.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Increase in insurance coverage:</strong> 74% of Indians are either covered or eligible for health insurance coverage.<ul>
<li><strong>Ayushman Bharat insurance scheme</strong> (2018) provides insurance against hospitalisation for up to Rs 5 lakh per year per family.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges affecting everyone in the population:</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/indias.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/indias.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), cancers, diabetes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Rising due to <strong>behavioural risk factors</strong> – an unhealthy diet, lack of physical activity and use of tobacco and alcohol.</li>
<li>As a result, the proportion of deaths due to <strong>non-communicable diseases (NCDs)</strong> has increased from around 38 – 62% in 2016.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The state of infrastructure</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Huge variations between states:</strong> Jharkhand, Karnataka and UP had the lowest number of primary healthcare institutions operating at full institutional capacity.<ul>
<li><strong>People have to bank on the private sector,</strong> which owns two-thirds of the country’s hospital beds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Gaps in services available in the metros and districts:</strong> 95% of private hospital beds are provided by district hospitals and nursing homes, yet <strong>they are unable to offer multispecialty care</strong> including tertiary and quaternary care.</p>
<p><strong>Low health insurance penetration:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Out-patient doctor consultation costs, diagnostics and drugs account for the biggest chunk (<strong>50%)</strong> of <strong>out-of-pocket</strong> (OOP) <strong>personal expenditures</strong>.</li>
<li>It is <strong>essential to provide insurance</strong> for the unorganised middle class to include identified out-patient costs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ethical and regulatory concerns around the use of AI and digital technology:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Surgery assisted by robots, the use of genetic codes, and clinical judgements based on AI are already widespread.</li>
<li>However, <strong>medical malpractice in substandard institutions</strong> and by unqualified medical practitioners is still not regulated.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Building awareness</strong> about the benefits of leading a healthy life will save millions from illness and decelerate premature death.</li>
<li><strong>More cost-effective treatment</strong> → bolster primary healthcare by establishing <strong>health and wellness centres.</strong></li>
<li>Making the <strong>centrally-run hospitals</strong> and the district hospitals fully functional.</li>
<li><strong>Bridging gaps in hospital services</strong> between large urban agglomerations and tier II and tier III cities.</li>
<li>Ethical and regulatory concerns prompted the ICMR to <strong>release guidelines foreseeing the problems of a lack of accountability</strong> for machine-made medical decisions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>India has shown how the impossible can be achieved. What is needed is <strong>out-of-the-box thinking</strong> and the resolve to steer the ship before a storm arrives.</p>

<p><strong>GS Paper 3</strong></p>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Infrastructure/Environment</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/world/fossil-fuel-lobby-behind-eu-s-dash-for-not-so-green-hydrogen-report-88511"><strong>DTE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> According to a new report, contrary to its spotless reputation, <strong>green hydrogen is not the key to the energy transition.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Green hydrogen:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It involves splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen <strong>using electricity from renewable energy sources</strong> like sunlight/wind.</li>
<li>It accounted for only 0.04% of globally produced hydrogen in 2021.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/global_hydro.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/global_hydro.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Limitations of the green hydrogen – dubbed as the ‘fuel of the future’:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Energy inefficient</strong> → 30% of renewable energy is lost while producing hydrogen.</li>
<li><strong>Indirectly contributes to global warming</strong> → when it reacts with hydroxyl radicals (responsible for breaking down and eliminating methane – a potent GHG) → could lead to delayed climate action.</li>
<li>Large-scale production requires <strong>vast amounts of land, water and renewable energy</strong>, which could lead to <strong>human rights violations and energy poverty.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How is the world progressing with green hydrogen?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The European Union (EU):</strong> Intends to increase green hydrogen production capacity as part of the bloc’s <strong>REPowerEU plan</strong> to 20 million tonnes.</li>
<li><strong>India:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/gh2-1.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/gh2-1.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Why (in spite of obstacles) are countries making progress with green hydrogen?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fossil or grey hydrogen accounts for 99% of the globally produced hydrogen.</li>
<li>A <strong>huge lobby</strong> linked to fossil fuels is pushing the hydrogen agenda to lock in detrimental infrastructure, as well as production and consumption models.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The corporate-driven green hydrogen race unfolding in Europe follows centuries-old <strong>colonial patterns</strong> –</p>
<ul>
<li>Resources are being appropriated to fuel Europe’s economy,</li>
<li>While negative impacts like ecological damage and land conflicts are conveniently outsourced to the periphery (African countries).</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> India Meteorological Department (IMD) is planning to issue a heat hazard analysis for India, including Delhi.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>IMD</strong> will soon issue a <strong>Heat Index</strong> (in addition to the day’s maximum and minimum temperatures)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is Heat Index?</strong></p>
<p>It will be a colour-based warning that will give an <strong>estimation of what temperature actually feels like</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>It factors Day’s</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Relative humidity</li>
<li>Wind speed</li>
<li>Maximum temperature</li>
<li>Cloud cover.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Usage of HI:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It will not only <strong>warn against Heat waves hazard</strong> but also list precautions people can take.</li>
<li>Calculation of HI will <strong>help states in formulating better Heat Action Plans (HAPs)</strong> for heatwave assessment, forecast, preparedness and mitigation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are heat waves?</strong></p>
<p>Heat waves are prolonged periods of excessively hot weather that may be accompanied by high humidity, often leading to a range of negative impacts on human health and the environment.</p>
<ul>
<li>The heat wave is considered if the <strong>maximum temperature of a station reaches at least 40°C</strong> for Plains and at <strong>least 30°C for</strong> Hilly regions.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Bombay HC will hear the dispute between the current leader of the Dawoodi Bohra sect and his challenger for the post.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the Dawoodi Bohras?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>They are <strong>a religious denomination among Shia Muslims</strong>.</li>
<li>Traditionally a <strong>community of traders and entrepreneurs</strong>, it has over 5 lakh members in India and over 10 lakh members across the world.</li>
<li>The top religious leader of the community is known as the <strong>Dai-al-Mutlaq –</strong> appointed through “divine inspiration”.<ul>
<li>A “nass” (conferment of succession) can be conferred upon any deserving member of the community and not necessarily a family member of the current Dai, although the latter is often the practice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the dispute?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In 2014, the 52nd Dai-al-Mutlaq, Syedna Mohammad Burhanuddin passed away, and his son Mufaddal Saifuddin succeeded him.</li>
<li>This was challenged by the late Syedna’s half-brother in the Bombay HC.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The practice of ex-communication in the Dawoodi Bohra community:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The leader of the community has the <strong>right to excommunicate</strong> (not being allowed to access a mosque or a burial) its members (generally those who contested the headship of the leaders).</li>
<li>However, the <strong>Bombay Prevention of Excommunication Act 1949</strong> invalidates the ex-communication of any member of any community.</li>
<li><strong>A petition on the constitutional validity</strong> of the practice is pending before the 9-judge Bench of the SC.<ul>
<li>The bench was constituted to review the <strong>2018 Sabarimala judgement</strong> – considering larger issues of essential religious practice.</li>
