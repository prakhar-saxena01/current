<p><strong>Context</strong>: Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has decided to start the process of seeking the states’ comments on the issue afresh.</p>
<p><strong>What is Punchhi Commission Report?</strong></p>
<p>The Punchhi Commission was constituted in <strong>2007</strong> under the chairmanship of former Chief <strong>Justice of India Madan Mohan Punchhi</strong>. In 2010, the Commission submitted its report to the Centre in <strong>seven volumes</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Deliberation on the report was carried out by <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/functions-and-responsibilities-of-the-union-and-the-states-issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure-devolution-of-powers-and-finances-up-to-local-levels-and-challenges-therein/issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure/inter-state-relations/inter-state-councils/#:~:text=Limitations%20of%20the%20council%3A&amp;text=The%20Inter%2Dstate%20council%20is,establishment%20of%20such%20a%20council"><strong>Inter-State Council</strong></a> <strong>(ISC’s) Standing Committee</strong> in 2017 and 2018.</li>
<li>However, <strong>the report is yet to be implemented</strong> and the government has said that it will seek the state’s view on the report again.</li>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Although some of the ideas of the commission have been put into practice, such as having the <strong>governor come from outside the state</strong>, there is a need for further deliberations and give concrete forms of useful recommendations as per current needs.</p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-2_2"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>International Relations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/the-middle-path-for-india-in-the-new-world-disorder/article65479476.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> India should follow a <strong>path of</strong> <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/world-news/indias-policy-of-multi-engagement-and-the-brics/2133842/">multi-engagement</a> and <strong>not multi-alignment</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>India has consistently resisted international pressure</strong> to criticise Russia and its actions.</li>
<li>For example, India has once again <strong>abstained from voting</strong> on a UN General Assembly resolution that condemns <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/11/11/could-india-be-a-mediator-between-russia-and-ukraine/">Russia’s invasion of Ukraine</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The global order in international relations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>After the end of the 2nd World War:</strong> A <strong>bipolar</strong> world, led by the U.S. and the Soviet Union, emerged.</li>
<li><strong>Following the disintegration of the Soviet Union (1991): Unipolarity replaced bipolarity</strong>, with the U.S. being its centre.</li>
<li>However, there have been discussions about whether American unipolarity has passed and a <strong>new world order</strong> (multipolar) <strong>has emerged.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Signs of the new world order:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>China’s rapid rise</li>
<li>Russia’s aggressive foreign policy – the invasion of Ukraine, <strong>challenged the post-Cold War security equilibrium</strong> in Europe.</li>
<li>The <strong>S.’s ability to shape geopolitical outcomes is clearly in decline</strong> (withdrawal from Afghanistan).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact of this transition (from uni to multipolarity):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Leaving the world in flux</strong>. Lack of clarity on which direction the world is headed makes <strong>policy-making harder for middle powers like India.</strong></li>
<li>While many governments (including India, Russia and China), welcome multipolarity, <strong>the U.S. remains the world’s most powerful military power.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>India and the</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/international-relations/important-international-institutions-agencies-and-further-structure-mandate-etc/nam-and-its-relevance/">Non-alignment</a> <strong>success:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When India became independent, <strong>the Cold War</strong> was in its early stages.</li>
<li>India’s <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/international-relations/important-international-institutions-agencies-and-further-structure-mandate-etc/nam-and-its-relevance/">non-alignment foreign policy doctrine</a> (equidistant from both blocs) did well in managing most of its (ideological and geopolitical) challenges.</li>
<li>Criticised as <strong>too idealistic</strong>, India has actually been <strong>flexible</strong> in readapting itself to the changes in the global and regional equations.</li>
<li>In the 1970s, after China started moving closer to the U.S., <strong>India started tilting towards the Soviet Union</strong> but stayed out of any Soviet-led military alliances.</li>
<li><strong>When the Soviet Union collapsed</strong>, India sought to transform its ties with the U.S. and integrate itself with the global economy in the new era of globalisation.</li>
<li>But it also maintained clos<strong>e defence and strategic ties with Russia</strong> and built a <strong>vibrant economic partnership with China.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A new set of challenges for India in the new global disorder:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/10/19/editorial-analysis-india-america-and-the-china-challenge/">S.-China’s great power contest in Asia</a> is unfolding right in India’s neighbourhood.</li>
<li><strong>The power imbalance</strong> between India and China, tempted India to join the American bloc.</li>
<li><strong>Abandoning its strategic autonomy</strong> and joining the U.S.-led bloc would limit India’s options, besides provoking China.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/05/12/india-china-border-dispute/">Border disputes between India and China</a>.</li>
<li>China has developed <strong>a strategic partnership with Pakistan</strong> and is raising its influence in other South Asian and Indian Ocean countries.</li>
<li>So, on all fronts (including challenges to India’s maritime influence), India faces the heat of China’s rise.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other challenges faced by India:</strong> U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and the Taliban’s return to power.</p>
<p><strong>How Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has complicated the situation for India?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/international-relations/bilateral-regional-and-global-groupings-and-agreements-involving-india-and-or-affecting-indias-interests/india-and-other-nations/india-russia-relations/">Russia is a traditional partner with which India</a> has deep defence ties.</li>
<li>As the West has moved to isolate Russia with heavy sanctions, India is under huge pressure <strong>to take a more critical position on Russia’s actions</strong>.</li>
<li>The West’s move to isolate Russia in Europe would <strong>push the country further into the Chinese embrace.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead for India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Learning from China</strong>. In the 1970s, China broke away from the Soviet communist fold and built <strong>a quasi-alliance with the U.S. and helped the ‘imperialist bloc’ defeat the Soviet communists.</strong><ul>
<li>Once China acquired enough economic and military power, it started gradually challenging the U.S.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Therefore, India’s primary focus should be on <strong>transforming itself economically and militarily,</strong> bridging the gap with China.</li>
<li>India should present itself as <strong>a natural stabilising power</strong> in South Asia and the Indian Ocean Region, and <strong>a source of prosperity.</strong></li>
<li>To address its continental security challenges, <strong>India has to work with Eurasian powers such as Russia and Iran</strong>, both of which are at odds with the U.S.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion: India should opt for multi-engagement</strong> (not multi-alignment) <strong>for a multipolar world</strong>, creating new pillars of the new global order through engagement and partnership with middle powers.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/04/16/international-energy-agency-iea/">International Energy Agency (IEA</a>) released the annual <strong>Methane Global Tracker report in 2023.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> The report has come after energy giants (Shell, BP, ExxonMobil) reported record profits last year as the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/11/editorial-analysis-lessons-from-russias-ukraine-war/">Russia-Ukraine war</a> <strong>drove up oil and natural gas prices.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Findings of the report:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The energy sector</strong> accounts for around <strong>40%</strong> of the total average methane emissions from human activity.</li>
<li><strong>Oil and natural gas companies</strong> are known to release methane into the atmosphere when natural gas is flared or vented.</li>
<li>It is also released through <strong>leaks</strong> from valves and other equipment during the drilling, extraction and transportation process.</li>
<li><strong>Fossil fuel companies</strong> emitted 120 million metric tonnes of methane into the atmosphere in 2022 and have done nothing to find and fix leaking infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations in the report:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Methane cuts (by 75%) from the energy sector are among the <strong>cheapest options to limit near-term global warming</strong> (lower global temperature rise by nearly 0.1 degree Celsius by mid-century).</li>
<li><strong>Reducing wastage</strong> by measures such as leak detection, repair and upgrading leaky equipment would cost <strong>less than 3% of the net income</strong> received by the oil and gas industry in 2022.</li>
<li>Methane emissions can be reduced with the help of the <strong>right policies and implementation and cheap and readily available technology</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> A first-year postgraduate medical student at the <strong>Kakatiya Medical College Dr Preethi was</strong> <strong>reportedly harassed by a male senior</strong>, following which she tried to end her life.</p>
<p><strong>About Ragging:</strong></p>
<p>Ragging, also known as hazing refers to the <strong>practice of subjecting new students to humiliating or abusive behaviour as a way of initiating them into a group or community</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ragging can take many forms, including <strong>physical and emotional abuse, harassment, bullying, and even sexual assault</strong>.</li>
<li>Apart from <strong>ragging, hazing, fagging, bullying, pledging and horseplaying</strong> are different terms.</li>

<p><strong>Previous instances of ragging in India:</strong></p>
<p><strong>TAMIL NADU – PON NAVARASU</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tamil Nadu <strong>passed the country’s first anti-ragging legislation in 1997 based on the Pon Navarasu case.</strong></li>
<li>Navarasu, son of the-<strong>then vice-chancellor of the University of Madras</strong>, was murdered. John David, a senior student of his college, <strong>confessed to the crime days later and surrendered to judicial custody.</strong></li>
<li>During a ragging session, Navarasu was <strong>assaulted, and forced to strip and lick David’s footwear,</strong> he <strong>was violently beaten up and killed when he refused to do so</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MAHARASHTRA – Payal Tadvi</strong></p>

<li>She belonged to the Adivasi Tadvi Bhil community and was found dead in Mumbai.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Data on caste discrimination in colleges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A parliamentary panel found rampant caste bias within All <strong>India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS),</strong> as MBBS students from <strong>Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes failed repeatedly in their exams.</strong> </li>
<li>The examiners tend to ask the <strong>name of the students and try to judge/ know if a student belongs to SC/ST community.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Source</strong>: <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/innovation-for-structural-additions-in-tankas-saves-womens-lives-in-barmer/article66563590.ece">TH</a></p>
<p>In Rajasthan’s Barmer district, there has been a surge in cases of <strong>women allegedly jumping to their deaths with their children in tanks and wells following marital disputes</strong>.</p>
<p>In response, the <strong>district administration, UNICEF, and Action Aid</strong> have launched the <strong>‘Anmol Jeevan Abhiyan’ (Precious Life Campaign)</strong>, which encourages the addition of <strong>hand pumps and locked covers</strong> to the large tanks or ‘tankas’ traditionally built for collecting rainwater in the rural areas.</p>
<ul>
<li>The hand pumps serve a <strong>dual purpose of preventing accidents and suicides</strong> while also providing water.</li>
<li>The closure of the tankas with locked covers <strong>reduces the accessibility and prompts those with suicidal tendencies</strong> to have second thoughts.</li>
<li><strong>A round-the-clock helpline</strong> has been established on the District Collectorate premises</li>
<li><strong>The ‘Har Din Hai Man Ka Din’ awareness</strong> programme has been introduced in schools.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact</strong>: The campaign has already <strong>equipped 130 tankas</strong> in one panchayat area with hand pumps, and the <strong>reports of suicides have gradually reduced</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Usage of the example:</strong> In governance/Ethics/Essay as a unique initiative to reduce the case of suicide, isolation among women, simple innovation to solve social issues, easy access to water, and foster relationships within families.</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) stumbled upon a <strong>1,300-year-old</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-heritage-culture/architecture/buddhist-architecture/"><strong>stupa</strong></a> in a mining site in <strong>Odisha’s Jajpur district.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The site is being used for supplying</strong> Khondalite stones to the <strong>12th Century Shree Jagannath Temple in Puri</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A stupa could be <strong>5-metre tall</strong></li>
<li>May belong to the <strong>7th or 8th century</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is a Khondalite Stone?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Khondalite</strong> (named after the Khond tribe of Odisha and Andhra Pradesh) is a foliated metamorphic rock</li>
<li>It is also called <strong>Bezwada Gneiss and Kailasa Gneiss</strong></li>
<li>These stones were widely used in <strong>ancient temple complexes</strong></li>

<p><strong>How the researchers came to this conclusion?</strong></p>
<p>The researchers collected <strong>sediments from glacial lakes in the Ladakh Range</strong>, which provided a record of climate change over the last seven thousand years.</p>
<p><strong>Significance of the study:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It will help us <strong>understand past climate changes, assess the impact of global warming</strong> and climate variability, and help us plan for the future of the region.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Solicitor General told the SC that the Punjab Governor had summoned the state Assembly for a budget session.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This came minutes before the SC was set to hear a challenge by the Punjab government against the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/functions-and-responsibilities-of-the-union-and-the-states-issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure-devolution-of-powers-and-finances-up-to-local-levels-and-challenges-therein/issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure/governors-role/">Governor</a>, <strong>over his refusal to summon the Budget session</strong> of Vidhan Sabha.</li>
<li>The Governor had cited <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/03/12/insights-into-editorial-the-office-of-the-governor/">Article 167</a> <strong>of the Constitution</strong>, which relates to the duties of the Chief Minister in furnishing information to the Governor.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Can the Governor refuse to summon the assembly?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Article 163(1)</strong> of the Indian Constitution says that there shall be a council of Ministers with the Chief Minister at the head <strong>to aid and advise the Governor in the exercise of his functions.</strong><ul>
<li>However, <strong>except</strong> in cases where s/he is required under this constitution to exercise his/her <strong>discretion</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Under Article 174</strong>, a Governor shall summon the House at a time and place, as s/he thinks fit.<ul>
<li><strong>Article 174 (2) (a)</strong> says a Governor may from “time to time” prorogue the House and <strong>174 (2) (b)</strong> allows her or him to dissolve the Legislative Assembly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A joint reading of the two provisions leaves the Governor with <strong>minimal discretion</strong> in summoning the house. <strong>For example,</strong> when the CM has lost the support of the House and his strength is debatable.</li>
<li>In 2016, the SC (in Nabam Rebia case) held that <strong>the power to summon the House is not solely vested in the Governor.</strong></li>

<p><strong>About Price Signal:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Price signal refers to the <strong>information that prices convey to both producers and consumers in a</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-economy-3/introduction-to-economics/different-types-of-economic-systems/"><strong>market economy</strong></a>. In particular, prices signal the <strong>relative scarcity of different goods in an economy</strong> when measured against the competing demands for these goods among consumers.<ul>
<li>Prices in a way <strong>coordinate the production and distribution of goods and services</strong> across the modern economy. This allocation of resources in large economies happens despite the absence of a central planner to direct the allocation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>
<p>When the <strong>price of water is high due to its limited supply in the market,</strong> consumers will have a greater incentive to use water more sparingly. Water producers, on the other hand, will have a greater incentive to <strong>bring more water into the market; this is because the high price of water offers them an opportunity to earn higher profits.</strong></p>

<p><strong>About Adenovirus:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Adenoviruses (members of the family Adenoviridae) <strong>are medium-sized, non-enveloped</strong>(without an outer lipid bilayer) viruses with an <strong>icosahedral nucleocapsid containing a double-stranded</strong> DNA genome. Their name derives <strong>from their initial isolation from human adenoids in 1953.</strong></li>
<li>Adenovirus is <strong>highly contagious</strong>. Infections are common in close-contact settings, such as childcare centres, schools, hospitals, and summer camps.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Symptoms:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>common cold or flu-like symptoms</li>
<li>fever</li>
<li>sore throat</li>
<li>acute bronchitis (inflammation of the airways of the lungs, sometimes called a “chest cold”)</li>
<li>pneumonia (infection of the lungs)</li>
<li>pink eye (conjunctivitis)</li>
<li>acute gastroenteritis (inflammation of the stomach or intestines causing diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea and stomach pain)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Treatment:</strong></p>
