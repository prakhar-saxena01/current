<h4 id="gs-paper-2"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Mechanisms, Laws, Institutions and Bodies constituted for the Protection and Betterment of these Vulnerable Sections</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/explained-what-is-indias-stand-on-same-sex-marriage/article66636166.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> A Bench led by CJI referred petitions to legally recognise same-sex marriages <strong>to a Constitution Bench of five judges</strong> of the SC.</p>
<p><strong>What is the case?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Even if LGBTQIA+ couples may live together, they do not enjoy the rights married couples do.</li>
<li><strong>For example,</strong><ul>
<li>They cannot adopt children or have a child by surrogacy;</li>
<li>They do not have automatic rights to inheritance, maintenance and tax benefits after a partner passes away,</li>
<li>They cannot avail of benefits like pension or compensation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Court has been hearing multiple petitioners’ requests for <strong>legal recognition of same-sex marriages</strong> under the <strong>Special Marriage Act (SMA) 1954</strong> and making the law <strong>gender-neutral</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How has the SC recently viewed LGBTQIA+ rights?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In Navtej Singh Johar</strong> <strong>(2018) case</strong> [decriminalised homosexuality by reading down <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/issues-related-to-third-gender-lgbtqia/section377/">Section 377</a> (IPC)], the SC held that the community is entitled to the benefit of equal citizenship and to the equal protection of the law.<ul>
<li><strong>Article 21</strong> of the Indian constitution (right to life and liberty) guarantees the choice of whom to partner with, the ability to find fulfilment in sexual intimacies, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>In K.S. Puttaswamy’s (2017) case</strong>, SC ruled that the fundamental right to privacy (including bodily autonomy, and sexual orientation) is intrinsic to life and liberty and thus integral to Article 21.</li>
<li>After these judgements, there was hope that same-sex marriages would be legalised, but that has not been the case, prompting many couples to move to court.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the Centre’s stand?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Opposed</strong> same-sex marriage and said <strong>judicial interference will cause complete havoc with the delicate balance of personal laws</strong>.</li>
<li>This definition of marriage is <strong>socially, culturally and legally</strong> ingrained into the very idea of the heterogeneous institution (a union between two persons of the <strong>opposite sex</strong>) of marriage.</li>
<li>The decriminalisation of Section 377 IPC does not give rise to a claim to seek recognition for same-sex marriage.</li>
<li>Even if same-sex marriage is claimed under Article 21, <strong>the right can be curtailed by the competent legislature</strong> on permissible constitutional grounds including legitimate state interest.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is clear that the <strong>two organs of the state are not in agreement</strong> on same-sex marriages.</li>
<li>Even if the Court rules in its favour, the march towards same-sex marriage <strong>in a diverse country with well-entrenched traditions will not be easy.</strong></li>
<li>Therefore, <strong>awareness of sex, gender and constitutional rights</strong> from the school level to change things on the ground is the need of the hour.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> At the inaugural edition of the <strong>global conference on millets</strong>, the PM of India spoke about how millets, considered to be “<strong>high-fibre foods</strong>”, are effective for health.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Based on India’s proposal, the year <strong>2023</strong> was declared the <strong>International Year of Millets</strong> (IYM) by the UNGA.</li>
<li>
<p>In order to make the IYM 2023 a <strong>‘people’s movement’</strong> and position India as the <strong>‘</strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/12/sansad-tv-special-report-millet-food-of-future/">global hub for millets</a><strong>’</strong>, all stakeholders are being engaged to spread awareness about the benefits of millets (Shree Anna) for the –</p>

<p>The organisation of the <strong>Global Millets (Shree Anna) Conference</strong> in India is an important programme in this context.</p>
</li>
<li>It was organised by the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (<strong>APEDA</strong>), Ministry of Commerce and Industry.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PM’s address at the Conference:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As Shree Anna is linked with Gaon as well as Garib (Village and the poor), <strong>it is becoming a medium of holistic development in India</strong>.</li>
<li>Shree Anna –<ul>

</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consistent efforts of the Indian government to turn Shree Anna into a global movement:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Millets were declared nutri-cereals in 2018</strong> → making the farmers aware of its benefits, and generating interest in the market.</li>
<li>Millets have been selected in 19 districts of the country under the ‘<strong>One District, One Product</strong>’ scheme.</li>
<li>The National Food Security Mission (NFSM) as <strong>NFSM-Coarse Cereals</strong> and implemented in 14 States.</li>
<li>In 2021, the <strong>PM POSHAN</strong> (earlier known as the mid-day meal scheme) was approved to include millet to enhance the nutritional outcome.</li>
<li>India is planning to launch a global initiative – Millet International Initiative for Research and Awareness (<strong>MIIRA</strong>), to encourage the consumption and production of millets.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact of these initiatives:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/water-warning-economic-stability-vanishing-rainfall-8503886/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> According to a Global Commission on the Economics of Water report, <strong>human activities</strong> (from destroying forests to burning gas-oil-coal for energy) <strong>are disrupting the rainfall the world depends on.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The report comes <strong>ahead of a key U.N. Water Conference</strong> – the first in five decades – aimed at charting a path to shore up declining global water security.</li>
<li>According to 2021 data from UN-Water, about <strong>3 billion people</strong> (almost one in three) live in water-stressed countries and a third of those facing critical pressures.</li>
<li>According to the <strong>UN FAO 2020 report</strong>, <strong>2 billion</strong> living in agricultural areas face high to very high water scarcity or shortages.</li>
<li><strong>Behind all the SDGs</strong> (Sustainable Development Goals), there is a volume of freshwater that powers the delivery of services.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Findings of the report:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Impact of losses of forests:</strong> Argentina’s soybean and wheat fields are experiencing worsening drought as the Amazon shrinks (water vapour rising from rainforests falls on distant places).<ul>
<li>This is further aggravated by land use change and <strong>climate change.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Huge economic, health and social stability threats:</strong><ul>
<li>Eroding water security poses <strong>a risk to everything from food supplies to hydropower production</strong>, a key source of low-carbon energy.</li>
<li>For example, severe water scarcity in the Horn of Africa has the potential to trigger <strong>political instability, conflict, displacement and migration.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations – Rethinking water:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A deeper understanding of how closely water supplies are linked to climate and nature protection.</li>
<li>Looking at <strong>freshwater as a global rather than just a local or regional issue</strong>, and strengthening how limited supplies are managed, shared and valued.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A desire to capture and store more water is leading to <strong>a surge in dam-building around the world,</strong> which often results in losses of forests, land rights of local communities, etc.</li>
<li>Increasing water storage in river dams can lead to <strong>growing tensions with neighbours downstream</strong>.<ul>
<li><strong>For example</strong>, the India-Pakistan conflict over more dam-building on the Indus River system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>With agriculture responsible for more than 70% of global freshwater use each year, <strong>trade in food is also trade in water.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improving water security requires a shift towards –<ul>
<li>More precise and sparing irrigation systems,</li>
<li>Crops that require less water,</li>
<li>Farming methods that stand up to drought and grow fewer thirsty crops in water-short places.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>In urban areas</strong>, boosting freshwater storage, recycling more wastewater and using less water in manufacturing will be key.</li>
<li>Richer nations should help poor countries in their water conservation efforts (financially, tech transfer).</li>
<li><strong>Just Water Partnerships</strong>, modelled on existing Just Energy Transition Partnerships – designed to speed a global transition to clean energy, should also be considered.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The U.N. Water Conference can be a “<strong>Paris moment</strong>” [<a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/07/08/financial-and-technological-commitments-under-unfccc-and-paris-agreement/">2015 Paris Agreement</a> on Climate Change] for water. This will ensure a sustainable and globally equitable future – that’s in every nation’s interest.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Data from the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management, shows that 74 villages in the state of Odisha are <strong>severely affected by shoreline erosion—the highest in the country</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>A study paper published in the journal Spatial Information Research in June 2018 finds that almost <strong>half of Odisha’s coast—196 km of shoreline—has undergone erosion between 1990 and 2015.</strong></li>
<li>A major reason for <strong>this is the</strong> <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/sea-level/"><strong>rising sea level</strong></a><strong>, which is surging along the Odisha coast</strong> at a rate faster than the rest of the country.</li>

<ul>
<li>Coastal erosion is the <strong>temporary or permanent loss of land owing to the action of waves, currents, tides, wind-driven water, waterborne ice, or other effects of storms</strong>.</li>
<li>It can also be the <strong>long-term removal of soil and rocks along the shoreline</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reasons for Coastal Erosion:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Natural reasons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wave energy</strong></li>
<li><strong>Natural hazards</strong></li>
<li><strong>El Niño</strong> and effects of <strong>climate change (e.g., sea level rise).</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Anthropogenic reasons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mining activities</strong> such as <strong>sand and Coral mining.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Fishing harbours and dams</strong> were constructed in the catchment area of rivers and ports.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact of Coastal Erosion:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Green belts and artificial reefs help</strong> in the mitigation of coastal erosion.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Coastal habitats</strong> such as <strong>Mangroves, Coral Reefs, and lagoons</strong> are recognized as the best defence against sea storms and erosion, deflecting and absorbing much of the energy of sea storms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Using Geosynthetic tubes:</strong> currently being used along the coast in Odisha.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Union environment ministry prepared <strong>an Integrated Coastal Zone Management Plan (ICZM</strong>) to be implemented on a <strong>pilot basis in Odisha, along with two other states prone to shoreline erosion—Gujarat and West Bengal.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: Kerala Government will organise the <strong>centenary</strong> celebrations of the Vaikom Satyagraha</p>
<p><strong>Vaikom Satyagraha</strong> (1924-25) was a movement in Travancore (modern-day Kerala) for temple entry of the depressed classes. It took place near the Shiva Temple at Vaikom, Kottayam district, Kerala.</p>
<p><strong>Issue</strong>: The protest was against the caste-based discrimination prevalent in Kerala and the rest of India, where lower-caste Hindus were not allowed to enter temples, and roads leading to temples were banned from them.</p>
<p><strong>Leaders</strong>: K. Kelappan, T K Madhavan, Velayudha Menon, K Neelakantan Namboothiri, and T R Krishnaswami Iyer</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> <strong>Finland</strong> has installed the world’s first sand battery that can store heat from renewable energy sources for months.</p>
<p><strong>Why sand?</strong></p>
<p>Sand can be heated up to <strong>600 degrees Celsius</strong>, and it has low heat conductivity, reducing energy loss.</p>
<p><strong>Capacity:</strong> The installed battery can store <strong>8 megawatt-hours of energy</strong> and release heat at <strong>0.1 M</strong>W.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Google makes a breakthrough in quantum computing, much bigger than AI—Quantum error correction</p>
<p><strong>What are the current issues in Quantum Computing?</strong></p>
<p>Currently, Quantum computers use qubits, to <strong>encode information as 0’s, 1’s</strong>, or both at the same time. However, qubits are very sensitive and even a stray light can cause calculation errors.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Quantum error correction protects information by encoding it across multiple physical qubits (instead of relying on individual physical qubits) to form a “logical qubit”</p>
<p><strong>Significance</strong>: It would go on to make quantum computing more accurate.</p>
<p><strong>Quantum Supremacy:</strong> Four years ago, Google said it completed a test in 200 seconds for a task that would take conventional supercomputers thousands of years.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Horseshoe crabs are disappearing from spawning grounds along Odisha’s Chandipur and Balaramgadi coasts.</p>
<p><strong>About  Horseshoe crabs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>They are <strong>marine and brackish water</strong> arthropods of the family Limulidae</li>
<li>Despite their name, they are <strong>not true crabs or crustaceans</strong></li>
<li>They are considered <strong>living fossils</strong> meaning they have existed nearly unchanged for at least 445 million years (before even dinosaurs existed)</li>
<li><strong>Odisha</strong> is their largest habitat in India</li>
<li><strong>Threats</strong>: Overharvesting for use as food, bait and biomedical testing</li>
<li><strong>Use</strong>: Blood of Horseshoe crab is very important for the preparation of rapid diagnostic reagents (used in chemical reactions)</li>
<li><strong>Schedule IV</strong> of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972</li>
<li><strong>IUCN Status</strong>: American horseshoe crab: <strong>Vulnerable</strong> and Tri-spine horseshoe crab: <strong>Endangered</strong>.</li>
