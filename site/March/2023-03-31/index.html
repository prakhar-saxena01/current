<h4 id="gs-paper-1"><strong>GS Paper 1</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>History of the World</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/g20-presidency-global-south-india-korean-war-8529177/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong>  In its G20 year, India has shown renewed interest in the only other diplomatic intervention by India in a distant war (apart from the recent Russian-Ukraine) seven decades ago – <strong>The Korean War</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/korea.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/korea.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>The Korean war:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It was fought between <strong>North Korea</strong> (supported by China and the then Soviet Union and invaded South Korea) and <strong>South Korea</strong> (supported by the US and allied countries) in <strong>1950</strong> and ended with an armistice in <strong>1953</strong>.</li>
<li>It was the result of the <strong>Cold War</strong> rivalry between the then superpowers US (capitalist) and the Soviet Union (communist).<ul>
<li>The peninsula had been divided at the <strong>end of World War II</strong> along the <strong>38th Parallel</strong>, with Soviet and US forces occupying the North and South respectively.</li>
<li><strong>In 1948,</strong> after the two Koreas declared themselves separate countries, and held their own elections, the occupying forces departed.</li>
<li>However, neither the North nor the South accepted the other and <strong>both claim the entire Korean peninsula</strong> even today.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>India’s lesser-known role in the war:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>India played a unique role, having <strong>no specific geo-political interests</strong> in the Korean Peninsula and maintaining <strong>a neutral position,</strong> and believing in the <strong>reunification of the peninsula</strong>.</li>
<li>India’s view at this time was that giving the <strong>People’s Republic of China admission</strong> into the UNSC could provide a resolution in Korea.</li>
<li>India made a <strong>huge diplomatic push to prevent an escalation</strong> into another world war, and for the parties to arrive at a quick ceasefire.</li>
<li>India sent the <strong>60th Parachute Field Ambulance</strong>, which did outstanding work treating wounded soldiers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>India at the UN:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>At the time of the invasion, <strong>India was among the six non-permanent members</strong> of the UNSC.</li>
<li>During its rotating presidency, <strong>3 resolutions</strong> (moved by the US) <strong>on the war</strong> came up in quick succession. <strong>For example,</strong> calling for a withdrawal of North troops from South territory, etc.</li>
<li>The urgent problem of what to do with the <strong>prisoners of war</strong> was given to <strong>K. Krishna Menon</strong> – India’s Permanent Representative to the UN and a member of the UN’s Special Political Committee.<ul>
<li>A <strong>Neutral Nations Repatriation Committee</strong> was set up and India was selected to chair the committee.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In an essay, ‘<strong>Between the Blocs: India, the UN, and Ending the Korean War’</strong>, British historian Robert Barnes recognised the key role played by India<ul>
<li>To bring the Korean war to a swift conclusion <strong>by reconciling the divergent positions of the two superpower blocs</strong>, and</li>
<li>Prevent the UN from adopting a policy that might lead to its escalation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As the world grapples to find an end to the war in Ukraine, <strong>India’s role and its experience (in ending the Korean war,70 years ago) can’t be neglected.</strong></li>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/house-panel-proposes-overarching-apex-body-for-glacier-management/">IE</a></p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: A Parliamentary Standing Committee in India has recommended the establishment of an <strong>overarching apex body for</strong> <a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/glacier/"><strong>glacier</strong></a> <strong>management in the country</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>What are</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/world-geography/physical-geography-of-the-world/geomorphology/external-forces-their-impact/landforms-developed-out-of-external-forces/erosion-by-ice-glacier/"><strong>glaciers</strong></a><strong>?</strong></p>
<p>A glacier is a large, perennial <strong>accumulation of crystalline ice, snow, rock, sediment</strong>, and often liquid water that originates on land and <strong>moves downslope under the influence of its own weight and gravity.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Status of Glaciers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Glaciers cover nearly 3<strong>% of Earth’s surface and 11%</strong> of Earth’s land area</li>
<li><strong>Source of three large river systems:</strong> Indus, Ganges, Brahmaputra</li>
<li><strong>Hindu Kush Himalayan</strong> Region is known as the “<strong>Water Towers of Asia</strong>“</li>
<li><strong>Himalayan</strong> mountains are referred to as the <strong>third pole</strong></li>
<li><strong>India has over 16000 glaciers</strong>. E.g Siachen glacier in the Himalayan region.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Threats recognized:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The majority of Himalayan glaciers are melting or retreating</strong>, which will severely affect flow in Himalayan River systems</li>
<li><strong>Melting glaciers can cause disasters</strong> like <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/02/08/what-is-a-glacier-outburst-flood-and-why-does-it-occur/">Glacier Lake Outburst Floods (GLOF),</a> glacier avalanches, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Melting of glaciers may lead to the shift of tree lines</strong> in the Himalayas and may also cause a change in the <strong>phonological behaviour</strong> of plants.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of data sharing on hydrological information</strong> with neighbouring countries</li>
<li><strong>Multiple ministries/departments/institutions</strong> with different mandates for dealing with Himalayan glaciers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations by the parliamentary panel:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Set up a single nodal agency</strong> for bringing out synergies among various government departments/ministries involved in glaciological research and monitoring</li>
<li><strong>Establish regional cooperation</strong> for the seamless sharing of hydrological information/data on glacier movement/behaviour</li>
<li><strong>Create a multi-hazard alert and warning</strong> system</li>
<li><strong>Increase involvement of Himalayan states, planners, scientists, and academicians</strong> in devising suitable measures for glacier management</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Lok Sabha on Wednesday cleared the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/15/competition-law-amendments-of-penalties-and-misses/"><strong>Competition (Amendment) Bill, 2022</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Aim of the Bill:</strong></p>
<p>Bring in greater <strong>regulation of corporates (particularly Big Tech firms)</strong></p>
<p>and promote and sustain competition in markets, protects consumers’ interest, and ensures freedom of trade for market participants.</p>
<p><strong>Background of the bill:</strong></p>
<p>It was introduced by the Ministry of Finance to <strong>amend the Competition Act, 2002</strong> to bring it in line with the modern development of new technology and the digital market. In December 2022, the Bill was referred to the <strong>Parliamentary Standing Committee</strong> on Finance for further scrutiny.</p>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Feature</strong></td>
<td><strong>Description</strong></td>
<td><strong>Significance</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Increases the regulation of combinations based on the ‘Value of Transaction’</strong></td>
<td><strong>Definition</strong>: ‘<strong>Combinations’</strong> means mergers, acquisitions, or amalgamation of an enterprise.<br><br>Any transaction <strong>exceeding ₹2,000 crore</strong> would require CCIs approval, helping to bring <strong>acquisitions in digital markets</strong> (Big Tech firms) under it.<br><br>Also, the bill <strong>prohibits entering into a combination</strong> that may cause an appreciable adverse effect on competition.</td>
<td><strong>Enhances scrutiny and regulation of larger transactions</strong> to prevent anti-competitive practices.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Reduces the time limit for approval of combinations</strong></td>
<td>The bill reduces the time limit for CCI approval on such transactions to <strong>150 days from 210 days</strong></td>
<td><strong>Speeds up the approval process</strong> for combinations, providing greater certainty for businesses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Expands the definition of ‘control’ for the classification of combinations</strong></td>
<td><strong>Definition</strong>: ‘<strong>Control’</strong> means, who (individual or other enterprises) exercises influence in the company.<br><br>The bill expands the <strong>definition of control as the ability to exercise material influence over the management, affairs, or strategic</strong> commercial decisions of an enterprise.</td>
<td>It now provides <strong>greater clarity</strong> on which transactions will be scrutinized.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Broadens the scope of Anti-competitive agreements</strong></td>
<td><strong>Definition: Anti-competitive agreements are a</strong>ny agreement for goods or services which has an <strong>appreciable adverse effect on competition in India</strong> and is therefore prohibited.<br><br>As per the new Bill, even the enterprises or persons <strong>not engaged in identical or similar businesses</strong> shall be presumed to be part of such agreements if they actively participate in such agreements.<br><br>Previously, such entities were exempted.</td>
<td>Including participation by unrelated entities, <strong>strengthens the regulation</strong> of such agreements.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Introduces Framework for Settlement and Commitment in anti-competitive proceedings</strong></td>
<td>The bill provides a framework for <strong>settlement and commitment for faster resolution of investigations by CCI.</strong><br><br>The bill <strong>limits the time period for filing information</strong> on it to CCI to three years.</td>
<td>Allows for <strong>faster resolution of anti-competitive</strong> proceedings and encourages enterprises to self-regulate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Decriminalisation of certain offences</strong></td>
<td>The Bill changes the nature of punishment for certain offences from the <strong>imposition of fines to civil penalties</strong>.</td>
<td>Reduces the burden on courts and provides a more proportionate punishment for certain offences.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Penalties</strong></td>
<td><strong>CCI can impose a penalty of up to 10%</strong> of a company’s average turnover in the “relevant market.<br><br>“<strong>Turnover”</strong> will refer to the “<strong>global turnover derived</strong> from all the products and services by a person or an enterprise”</td>
<td>Experts say this is the highly <strong>contentious provision</strong> that will result in higher penalties for global multi-product companies.</td>
</tr>

<p><strong>Terms used in the Bill</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hub-and-Spoke Cartels:</strong> Entities not engaged in similar businesses but have influence. The amendment broadens the <strong>scope of ‘anti-competitive agreements’</strong> to catch entities that facilitate cartelisation even if they are not engaged in identical trade practices.</li>
<li><strong>Gun Jumping:</strong> Gun jumping refers to the <strong>illegal practice of prematurely disclosing information</strong> or completing a transaction related to a merger or acquisition before the transaction has been fully approved by regulatory authorities.</li>
<li><strong>New Age Market</strong>: New technology-enabled firms or new types of businesses, that are not under the preview of CCI</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way forward:</strong></p>
<p><strong>‘A National Competition Policy’ is needed in India:</strong> E.g. Competition policy has also been adopted and implemented by the UK, Australia, Denmark, Italy, Turkey, Mexico, Hong Kong, Malawi and Botswana.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>With the new changes, the Commission should be better able to manage certain aspects of the New Age market and make its operation more robust.</p>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/india-solar-push-looming-waste-management-challenge/article66674910.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Even while Indian policymakers are working hard to shift to a <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Circular-Economy.pdf"><strong>circular economy</strong></a>, there are still <strong>no defined guidelines for waste management</strong> in the <strong>solar photovoltaic (PV) sector</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>A typical PV panel is dominated by: Crystalline silicon (c-Si) technology</strong> → 93% of c-Si modules (made up of silver, tin and lead) and 7% of cadmium telluride (CdTe) thin film modules (made of glass, encapsulant, and compound semiconductor).</p>
<p><strong>What is PV waste?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>India stands <strong>4th</strong> in solar PV deployment globally and its solar power installed capacity has reached <strong>~62 GW</strong> by 2022.</li>
<li>India’s latest <strong>PLI scheme</strong> promotes the domestic manufacturing of high-efficiency solar PV modules.</li>
<li>This is great, but it also indicates <strong>massive amounts of solar PV waste in the future</strong>.</li>
<li>India could generate <strong>50,000-3,25,000 tonnes</strong> of cumulative PV waste by 2030 and more than <strong>4 million tonnes by 2050 (</strong>International Renewable Energy Agency) → expected to make India <strong>one of the world’s top five leading</strong> PV waste producers.</li>
<li><strong>~50% of total materials</strong> can be recovered through waste management and recycling processes.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/waste.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/waste.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Growing informal (~80%) handling of PV waste</strong> → <strong>accumulates at landfills</strong> → causes acidification, leaching of toxic metals (lead, cadmium) into the soil → contaminates the local water.</li>
<li><strong>Gradual incineration</strong> releases pollutants like sulphur dioxide, hydrogen fluoride, and hydrogen cyanide into the atmosphere.</li>
<li><strong>Misinformation/ignorance</strong> about appropriate disposal practices among multiple actors and institutions (producers/owners/consumers/waste disposal facilities) across the supply chain.</li>
<li><strong>The market</strong> to recycle PV waste is <strong>minuscule in India</strong> because of a lack of suitable incentives and schemes.</li>
<li><strong>The absence of a body</strong> to measure, monitor, and report solar PV waste.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recent initiatives by the Indian govt:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revised</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/11/11/government-notified-e-waste-management-rules-2022/"><strong>e-waste management Rules in 2022</strong></a><strong>:</strong> MoEF&amp;CC brought solar PV cells, panels, and modules under its ambit.</li>
<li><strong>Green Credit Programme:</strong> Launched under the Environmental Protection Act (1986) and announced in the UB 2022-2023, it aims to promote green growth and sustainable practices.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best practices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>EU:</strong> Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive makes producers responsible for safely and responsibly disposing of end-of-life PV panels.</li>
<li><strong>US</strong>: States have the freedom to establish their own solar PV regulatory standards.</li>
<li><strong>Japan:</strong> Manufacturers are responsible for developing environment-friendly recycling technologies through PPP and launching awareness campaigns about their benefits.</li>
<li><strong>China:</strong> Introduced life-cycle management to improve the resource efficiency of solar PV panels. It is also <strong>developing recycling processes to recover silicon</strong> and process them back into solar wafers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Gaps to be identified by India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Not to club PV waste with other e-waste</strong>. India should –<ul>
<li><strong>Formulate provisions</strong> specific to PV waste treatment within the ambit of the e-waste guidelines. <strong>Build a legislative framework</strong> to enforce the Extended Producer Responsibility Rules.</li>
<li><strong>Set up a central insurance or a regulatory body</strong> to protect against financial losses incurred in waste collection and treatment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Not to classify PV wastes as ‘hazardous’.</strong> India should –<ul>
<li>Run pan-India sensitisation drives and awareness programmes,</li>
<li>Specify clear recycling targets and recycling rates in the PV waste management policy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>More attention to domestic R&amp;D efforts</strong> promoted through suitable regulatory incentives, recycling programmes, appropriate infrastructure facilities, and adequate funding.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Best practices could be a good reference point for India to develop <strong>‘Made in India’</strong> manufacturing capabilities, recycling technologies, and waste management strategies in this field.</p>

<p><strong>India-specific findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Overall, <strong>India ranks fifth</strong> among the top 10 contributors to warming.</li>
<li>India’s emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) – <strong>CO2, CH4 and nitrous oxide (N2O)</strong> from 1851-2021 have resulted in <strong>0</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>04°C, 0.03°C and 0.006°C</strong> of global warming over pre-industrial levels, respectively.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Causes of warming:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fossil fuel remains the biggest culprit.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Land use, land-use change, and forestry</strong> (LULUCF) accounted for <strong>38%</strong> of the total warming from CH4 and 72% from N2O emissions between 1851-2021.</li>
<li><strong>The contribution of India, China and Brazil</strong> towards warming due to CH4 and N2O increased by 110%, 56% and 55%, respectively, compared to CO2-related warming alone.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>These 3 GHGs are included in most countries’ <strong>Nationally Determined Contributions.</strong> Hence, the dataset is uniquely positioned to <strong>inform climate policy and benchmarking</strong>.</li>
<li>It would help in <strong>tracking contributions to climate change</strong> and understanding the <strong>burden of responsibility carried by each country</strong> → pursuing equitable decarbonisation pathways.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> According to <strong>the World Bank’s ‘Striving for Clean Air: Air Pollution and Public Health in South Asia’</strong> report, <strong>9 out of the world’s 10 cities with the worst air pollution are in South Asia.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Highlights of the report:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This report <strong>quantifies particulate matter (PM) emissions</strong> and how they disperse in the atmosphere.</li>
<li><strong>Ambient air pollution is a public health crisis</strong> in South Asia,<ul>
<li>Not only imposing high economic costs</li>
<li>But also causing an estimated 2 million premature deaths each year.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In South Asia, <strong>nearly 60% of the population</strong> lives in areas where concentrations of 5 exceed an annual mean of 35 μg/m3 (WHO prescribes 5 μg/m3).</li>
<li>In the densely populated <strong>Indo-Gangetic Plain</strong>, it is over 20 times higher than the WHO-prescribed levels.</li>
<li>This report identifies <strong>six major airsheds in South Asia</strong> where spatial interdependence in air quality is high.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/six_illu.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/six_illu.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Main causes of air pollution in South Asia:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Solid fuel combustion</strong></li>
<li>The current management practices of <strong>municipal waste</strong> in the region, include burning plastics.</li>
<li>Generation of secondary PM in the form of <strong>ammonia (NH₃)</strong> emissions related to the agriculture sector.</li>
<li>In the western part of South Asia, natural sources, such as <strong>dust, sea salt, and forest fires</strong>, are an important source of air pollution.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Controlling ambient air pollution is difficult without a <strong>better understanding of the activities</strong> that emit PM and how emissions travel across locations.</li>
<li><strong>Interdependence in air quality within airsheds</strong> in South Asia is necessary when weighing <strong>alternative pathways for pollution control</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Focusing on hotspots through regional cooperation</strong> would reduce mean exposure to 26 μg/m³.</p>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/new-fees-on-upi-payments-why-paytm-gpay-phonepe-and-other-users-need-not-worry/articleshow/99084060.cms"><strong>TOI</strong></a><strong>,</strong> <a href="https://www.livemint.com/news/india/upi-new-rules-what-is-ppi-and-how-will-it-impact-users-11680096123758.html"><strong>LM</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The <strong>National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI)</strong> has allowed prepaid payment instruments (PPIs) to be part of the interoperable <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/05/the-unified-payments-interface-upi/">Unified Payments Interface (UPI)</a> ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>What does the new guideline say?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The new guidelines, effective from April 1st, levy a <strong>1.</strong><strong>1% charge on UPI transactions above ₹2,000</strong> while using PPIs.</li>
<li><strong>The charges are only applicable for PPI merchant transactions</strong>, and there are no charges for the bank account to bank account-based UPI payments.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation using an example:</strong></p>
<p><strong>A PPI payment via UPI</strong> means a transaction done via a <strong>wallet, like PhonePe Wallet</strong> through a UPI QR code. This means that if users <strong>have money in their say PhonePe Wallet</strong> and want to make a payment via the merchant’s UPI QR code, then on transactions above Rs 2,000, an interchange fee of up to <strong>1.1%</strong> will be levied. This fee is <strong>charged to the merchant</strong> and not the customer.</p>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The move is expected to <strong>help UPI merchants,</strong> who can accept wallet payments regardless of the wallet being used by the customer, thereby <strong>increasing payment alternatives</strong> for customers.</li>
<li>The <strong>interoperability of KYC wallets will also eliminate</strong> the need for customers to carry multiple cards and reduce fraud and theft.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are PPIs?</strong></p>
<p><strong>The payment and Settlement Act, 2005</strong> defined Prepaid Payment Instruments (PPIs) as instruments of <strong>payment that facilitate buying of goods and services</strong>, including the transfer of funds, financial services and remittances, against the value stored within or on the instrument.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> Online wallets like PAYTM wallets, Amazon Pay wallets and preloaded gift cards</p>
<p><strong>About NPCI</strong></p>
<p><strong>The National Payments Corporation of India (est. 2008, HQ: Mumbai)</strong> is an umbrella organization for <strong>operating retail payments and settlement systems</strong> in India, is an initiative of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) under the provisions of the <strong>Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007,</strong> for creating a robust Payment &amp; Settlement Infrastructure in India.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a <strong>not-for-profit organisation</strong> registered under Section 8 of the Companies Act 2013</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) has upheld a penalty of Rs 1,337 crore imposed by India’s competition regulation body on Google for its <strong>anti-competitive conduct</strong> in the Android ecosystem.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, the NCLAT set aside some of the conditions that would have severely impacted Google’s products.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the issue about?</strong></p>
<p>The CCI, last year, had imposed a penalty of Rs 1,337 crore on Google for mandating pre-installation of its <strong>entire Google Mobile Suite (GMS),</strong> a family of key Google apps and services, on smartphones running on Android. This, according to the CCI, was an abuse of Google’s market dominance.</p>
<p><strong>About NCLAT</strong></p>
<p><strong>The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (est. 2016)</strong> is also the <strong>Appellate Tribunal to hear and dispose of appeals</strong> against any direction issued or decision made or order passed by the Competition Commission of India (CCI).

<p><strong>Context:</strong>  The <strong>National Dairy Research Institute</strong> ( est. 1956, under ICAR, based in Haryana’s Karnal) has produced the <strong>first-ever clone of a calf belonging to the indigenous Gir cow breed</strong>. The calf has been named Ganga.</p>
<p><strong>Process:</strong></p>
<p>Scientists used <strong>three animals for producing this calf</strong>: <strong>Oocyte</strong> was taken from the <strong>Sahiwal breed</strong>, a somatic cell from the <strong>Gir breed</strong>, and a <strong>surrogate animal</strong> was a crossbreed.</p>
<p><strong>What is Reproductive cloning?</strong></p>
<p>Reproductive cloning is a process by which an exact genetic replica, or clone, of an existing organism, is created through a type of cloning called somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). This involves removing the nucleus of an egg cell and replacing it with the nucleus of a somatic cell (a non-reproductive cell) from the organism to be cloned.</p>
