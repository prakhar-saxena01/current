<h4 id="gs-paper-1"><strong>GS Paper 1</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Indian culture – salient aspects of Art Forms, Literature and Architecture from ancient to modern times</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/antiquities-abroad-indian-international-laws-metropolitan-museum-of-art-subhash-kapoor-8495034/#:~:text=No%20person%20shall%2C%20himself%20or,Survey%20of%20India%20(ASI)."><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> According to an RTI, only 486 antiquities have been reported as missing (since Independence) from the 3,696 monuments protected and maintained by the ASI.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/l-r.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/l-r.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>What is antiquity?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>India’s <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/12/27/antiquities-and-art-treasuries-act-must-be-revised-so-as-to-make-trading-in-indian-art-more-institutionalized-do-you-agree-comment/"><strong>Antiquities and Art Treasures Act (AATA), 1972</strong></a>, defines “antiquity” as any coin, sculpture, painting, epigraph or other work of art or craftsmanship that has been in existence <strong>for not less than 100 years</strong>.<ul>
<li><strong>For a manuscript, record or other documents</strong> which are of scientific, historical, literary or aesthetic value, this duration is <strong>not less than 75 years.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/international-relations/important-international-institutions-agencies-and-further-structure-mandate-etc/un/unesco/"><strong>UNESCO</strong></a> <strong>1970 Convention</strong> defines “<strong>cultural property</strong>” as the one designated by countries having importance for archaeology, prehistory, history, literature, art or science.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How have Indian laws relating to the country’s heritage evolved?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Before Independence</strong>, the <strong>Antiquities (Export Control) Act 1947</strong> ensured that no antiquity could be exported without a license.</li>
<li><strong>After Independence,</strong><ul>
<li>All the <strong>Union, State and Concurrent Lists</strong> of the <strong>Schedule VII</strong> of the Indian Constitution deal with the country’s heritage.</li>
<li>In <strong>1958</strong>, [<strong>The Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act</strong>](https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/02/21/sansad-tv-75-years-laws-that-shaped-india-the-ancient-monuments-archaeological-sites-remains-act-1958/#:~:text=The%20Ancient%20Monuments%20and%20Archaeological%20Sites%20and%20Remains%20Act%20(or,of%20archaeological%20excavations%20and%20for) was enacted.</li>
<li>A few incidents of theft of antiquities along with the <strong>UNESCO convention (1970</strong>), prompted the government to enact the <strong>AATA 1972.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Salient provisions of the AATA 1972:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Other than the Central Government, <strong>no person can export any antiquity or art treasure.</strong></li>
<li>No person can carry on the business of selling any antiquity <strong>except in accordance with the terms and conditions of a licence</strong> – granted by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).</li>
<li>After the AATA was implemented (1976), the Centre asked traders in antiquities and art objects <strong>to declare their possessions of antiquities.</strong></li>
<li>Every person who owns, controls or is in possession of any antiquity <strong>shall register such antiquity</strong> and obtain a certificate.<ul>
<li><strong>What is the ‘provenance’ of antiquity?</strong> It includes the list of all owners from the time the object left its maker’s possession to the time it was acquired by the current owner.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Registered antiquities in India:</strong> So far, the National Mission on Monuments and Antiquities (2007), <strong>has registered 3.52 lakh antiquities among the 16.70 lakh it has documented.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Threats to antiquities:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The illicit import, export and transfer of ownership</strong> of cultural property are one of the main causes of the impoverishment of the cultural heritage of the countries of origin (UNESCO).</li>
<li>Almost 50 years after the UNESCO convention, the illicit international traffic of cultural items <strong>is sadly increasingly prolific</strong> [INTERPOL report (2019)].</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Can India bring back antiquities?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>There are three categories</strong> – antiquities taken out of India pre-independence; taken out since independence and until the implementation of AATA and antiquities taken out since 1976.</li>
<li><strong>For items in the first category,</strong> requests have to be raised bilaterally or on international fora.</li>
<li>Antiquities in the <strong>second and third categories</strong> can be retrieved by raising an issue bilaterally with proof of ownership and with the help of the UNESCO convention.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why are laws incapable of stopping illicit activity?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The registered antiquities in India <strong>are a very small portion of the total number</strong> (estimated to be around 58 lakh).</li>
<li>In India, the problem with missing antiquities is that in many cases, <strong>there is no FIR</strong>, which is the first thing in order to prove ownership.</li>
<li>The biggest challenge India is facing in bringing back antiquities is the <strong>gap between the artefacts officially declared missing</strong> and surfacing in global markets/museums.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Robust database</strong> of existing and stolen antiques and artefacts.</li>
<li><strong>ASI must be provided with additional resources</strong> for the protection and maintenance of antiquities.</li>
<li><strong>International co-operation</strong> constitutes one of the most efficient means of protecting each country’s cultural property.</li>

<h4 id="gs-paper-2"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus: Social Justice – Health</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/guidelines-on-medical-negligence-under-consideration-says-union-health-ministry/article66617921.ece"><strong>The Hindu</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has taken into consideration the <strong>healthcare sector’s long-standing demand to frame guidelines for determining medical negligence cases.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It has <strong>been more than 17 years</strong> since the Supreme Court, for <strong>the first time in the Jacob Mathew case in 2005</strong>, directed the Centre to frame statutory rules in consultation with the-then medical education regulator <strong>Medical Council of India (MCI) to deal with medical negligence cases as it impacts both doctors and patients</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Medical Negligence:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Medical negligence, also known as <strong>medical malpractice</strong>, refers to a situation where a <strong>healthcare professional fails to provide the appropriate standard of care to a patient, resulting in harm, injury, or death.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Supreme Court criteria on Medical Negligence:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In <strong>Kusum Sharma v. Batra Hospital &amp; Medical Research Centre</strong>, a two-judge Supreme Court panel recognized several criteria to regulate medical negligence cases.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bolam Test</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Bolam test was created in 1957 as a result of the judgement of the House of Lords in Bolam v Frierm Barnet Hospital Management Committee, which said that a <strong>doctor may be able to escape a lawsuit for negligence if he can show that other medical practitioners would have behaved in the same manner.</strong></li>
<li>The Bolam test, which argues that a doctor is not negligent if <strong>what he has done would be approved by a responsible body of medical opinion in the relevant speciality at the time, remains the principal test to assess ‘standard of care’.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Various incidents of medical negligence:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Foreign matter left inside after surgery</strong></li>
<li><strong>Wrong part Removed</strong></li>
<li><strong>Doctor acting in a callous manner</strong></li>
<li><strong>Death due to transfusion of blood from a wrong group</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Implications of medical negligence:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Physical harm</strong></li>
<li><strong>Emotional harm</strong></li>
<li><strong>Financial harm</strong></li>
<li><strong>Loss of trust</strong></li>
<li><strong>Impact on the healthcare system</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Issues in the relation:</strong></p>
<p>India-Australia relations face several challenges, including the controversy over the Adani coal mine project, which caused tensions due to protests by activists. Visa restrictions for Indian students and professionals seeking to work in Australia have also been a concern. Additionally, attacks on the Indian diaspora and temples by Khalistan supporters have caused strains in the relationship.</p>
<p><strong>Way forward:</strong></p>
<p>The India-Australia relationship has grown stronger due to shared interests, values, and goals. Both countries want a free, inclusive, and rules-based Indo-Pacific region, and they aim to resolve any disagreements or conflicts through peaceful means.</p>

<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Infrastructure (Energy)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/hardeep-s-puri-writes-powering-amrit-kaal-ndia-energy-week-2023-8492800/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> An integrated approach that focuses on renewable energy along with the exploration of traditional fuels is the key to <strong>energy security</strong> in the next 25 years in India.</p>
<p><strong>Need for an integrated approach:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>3As:</strong> Ensuring energy <strong>access, availability and affordability</strong> for India’s large population.</li>
<li>As the world’s fastest-growing major economy with rising energy needs, India will a<strong>ccount for approximately 25% of the global energy demand</strong> <strong>growth between 2020-2040</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The success story of India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When petrol and diesel prices went up by 35-40% in the US, Canada, Spain and the UK, <strong>prices of diesel in India have actually gone down</strong> in the last 1 year.<ul>
<li>This is despite the fact that <strong>India imports over 85% of its crude oil</strong> and 55% of its natural gas requirements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When several countries in India’s neighbourhood have had dry outs and power cuts to manage demand, <strong>there has been no shortage of fuel anywhere in India.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How was this made possible?</strong></p>
<p>Through a pragmatic and balanced energy strategy → ensuring <strong>energy justice.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Focus on traditional fuels:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Centre and many states <strong>announced massive cuts in excise duty and VAT rates</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Oil PSUs absorbed huge losses</strong> to ensure that the massive hikes in the prices of crude oil and natural gas were not passed on to Indian consumers.</li>
<li><strong>Subsidised APM gas</strong> for the city gas distribution sector was drastically increased.</li>
<li><strong>Imposing an export cess</strong> on petrol, diesel and ATF.</li>
<li><strong>A windfall tax on domestically produced petroleum products</strong> to prevent refiners and producers from profiteering at the cost of domestic consumers.</li>
<li>Over the years, India has expanded –<ul>
<li><strong>Its network of crude oil suppliers</strong> from 27 nations to 39 nations. <strong>For example,</strong> in the US, the energy trade has gone up 13 times in the last four years.</li>
<li><strong>Its refining capacity</strong> (450 MMT by 2040) – India is a global exporter of petroleum products [refining capacity is the 4th-largest after the US, China and Russia].</li>
<li>Traditional fuel exploration – reduced the prohibited/no-go areas in its EEZ by 99%, releasing nearly 1 million sq km for exploration.</li>
<li><strong>These strategic market cards</strong> not only ensured <strong>affordable</strong> energy for Indian consumers but also had a calming effect on global petroleum markets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>India is also pushing to move towards a <strong>gas-based economy</strong> by increasing the share of gas from the current <strong>3 to 15% by 2030</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Focus on alternative fuels/energy transition:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>India announced its <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/11/02/india-will-achieve-net-zero-emissions-by-2070/"><strong>net-zero emissions by 2070</strong></a> <strong>and cutting down emissions by 1 billion tonnes by 2030 targets</strong>.</li>
<li>At the <strong>India Energy Week 2023</strong>, India took a giant stride in <strong>its</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/20/sansad-tv-national-policy-on-biofuels/"><strong>biofuel revolution</strong></a> <strong>by launching E20</strong> – 20% ethanol-blended gasoline, which will be rolled out in 15 cities in the next 2 years.<ul>
<li>India’s ethanol-blending gasoline has grown from just <strong>53% in 2013-14 to 10.17% in 2023.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>India is also setting up <strong>five 2nd-generation ethanol plants</strong> that can convert agricultural waste into biofuel, further reducing pollution due to stubble burning, and generating income for farmers.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/05/centre-clears-%E2%82%B919744-crore-green-hydrogen-mission/#:~:text=Development%20of%20Green%20Hydrogen%20Production,6%20lakh%20jobs%20by%202030"><strong>The National Green Hydrogen Mission</strong></a> has been launched with an outlay of Rs 19,744 crore to accelerate India’s efforts <strong>towards 4 MT of annual green hydrogen production</strong>.<ul>
<li>It will save Rs 1 lakh crore in cumulative fossil fuel import savings by 2030.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>India is also supporting <strong>electric vehicles through a production-linked incentive scheme</strong> to make advanced fuel cells of 50-gigawatt hours.</li>
<li>India is also targeting the installation of <strong>alternative fuel stations (EV charging/ CNG/ LPG/ LNG/ CBG)</strong> at 22,000 retail outlets by <strong>May 2024</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Energy security and independence</strong> remain the main objectives as India implements its Amrit Kaal plan to grow to a <strong>$ 26 trillion economy by 2047</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-3_1"><strong>GS Paper 3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Linkages between Development and Spread of Extremism</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/what-is-the-soo-agreement-manipur-govt-withdrew-from-8494829/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The state government of Manipur decided to withdraw from the <strong>Suspension of Operations</strong> (SoO) agreement with two hill-based tribal militant groups.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Two hill-based tribal militant groups – <strong>Kuki National Army (KNA) and Zomi Revolutionary Army (ZRA)</strong> were allegedly influencing agitation among forest encroachers.</p>
<p><strong>The Kuki people:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>They are an <strong>ethnic group native to the Mizo Hills</strong> (formerly Lushai) – a mountainous region in the southeastern part of Mizoram and Manipur in India.</li>
<li>In Northeast India, they are present in <strong>all states except Arunachal Pradesh</strong> and some 50 tribes of Kuki peoples are recognised as STs.</li>
<li>The <strong>Chin</strong> people of Myanmar and the <strong>Mizo</strong> people of Mizoram are related to the Kukis and are collectively termed the <strong>Zo</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/kuki_homeland_1.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/kuki_homeland_1.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What are the roots of the Kuki insurgency?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Kuki insurgency gained momentum <strong>after ethnic clashes with the Nagas of Manipur</strong> in the early 1990s.</li>
<li>While the two tribes have shared <strong>a hostile relationship since colonial times</strong>, clashes took place in the 1990s when claims of “kuki homeland” in the Manipur hills <strong>overlapped</strong> with the imagined Naga homeland of Greater Nagaland/Nagalim.</li>
<li>While the Naga movement is the country’s longest-running insurgency, <strong>underground Kuki groups too have fought the Indian government for an ‘independent Kuki homeland’ since then</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the SoO pact?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There are nearly 30 Kuki insurgent groups in Manipur, of which 25 are under <strong>tripartite</strong> Suspension of Operations (SoO) with the Government of India and the state.</li>
<li>The SoO pact was signed on <strong>August 22, 2008</strong>, with the primary objective of <strong>initiating political dialogue</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are the terms of the SoO pact?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The important terms under the pact are that security forces, including state and central forces, are <strong>not to launch any operations</strong>, nor can the underground groups.</li>
<li>The signatories (like UPF, and KNO) shall <strong>abide by the Constitution of India</strong>, the laws of the land and the <strong>territorial integrity of Manipur</strong>.</li>
<li>They are prohibited from committing all kinds of atrocities, extortion, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact of SoO pact:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Kuki outfits who were initially demanding a separate Kuki state have come down to a ‘<strong>Kukiland territorial council</strong>’, which would have <strong>financial and administrative powers</strong> independent of the Manipur Assembly and government.</li>
<li><strong>As a rehabilitation package</strong>, the UG cadres living in the designated camps are given a monthly stipend of Rs 5000.<ul>
<li>Financial assistance is also being provided to maintain the designated camps.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What next?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The revocation of the SoO agreement has now raised questions about the <strong>government’s intent</strong> to resolve the issue earliest.</li>
<li>Feeling ignored, the outfits could once again start insurgency activities <strong>threatening the internal security of a strategically located region.</strong></li>

<p><strong>About Alluri Sitharama Raju:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Raju <strong>channelled the discontent of the hill people in Ganjam, Visakhapatnam,</strong> and Godavari into an effective guerrilla resistance against the British.</li>
<li>Colonial rule threatened the tribals’ traditional <strong>podu (shifting) cultivation</strong>, as the government sought to secure forest lands.</li>
<li>The <strong>Forest Act of 1882 banned the collection of minor forest produce such as roots and leaves, and tribal people were forced into labour by the colonial government.</strong></li>
<li>Strong anti-government sentiment, exploded into armed resistance in August 1922.</li>

<p><strong>About Komaram Bheem:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Komram Bheem</strong> was born in the <strong>Gond tribal community at Sankepally village</strong> in Komarambheem District, <strong>renamed after him in 2016</strong>.</li>
<li>The Nizam government used to collect tax in the name of <strong>‘Bambram’ and ‘Dupapetti’</strong> from people grazing cattle and collecting firewood for cooking.</li>
<li>In opposition, Bheem spread the message of “<strong>Jal, Jangal, Zameen” (water, forest land) among tribal people</strong>. This has become a clarion call for indigenous people’s rights to natural resources, used in many parts of India to date.</li>
