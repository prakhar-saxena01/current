<h4 id="gs-paper-2"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Issues relating to Poverty and Hunger</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/global-data-mismatch-due-to-methodological-issues-notes-eac-pm-paper/articleshow/98710175.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=cppst"><strong>ET</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> According to the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM), India’s poor performance on specific international indicators <strong>despite rising per capita income</strong> is due to methodological issues.</p>
<p><strong>Socio-development indicators where systematic biases exist:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/17/acute-malnutrition-risking-30-million-childrens-lives-who/">Childhood Stunting</a>,</li>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/issues-related-to-women/women-in-workforce/">Female Labour Force Participation Rate</a> and</li>
<li>Life Expectancy</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The impact of methodological issues:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Conceptual ambiguity</strong>, flawed benchmarks and shoddy methodology → flawed estimation → overestimating the level of deprivation.</li>
<li>The growing use of Environment Social and Governance (ESG) norms in investment and trade decisions will mean that <strong>real-world decision-making</strong> will be increasingly impacted by biased data.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aggravates the problem?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Indian statistical authorities do not publish accurate data on a regular basis.</li>
<li><strong>For example</strong>, the registrar general of India (RGI) publishes life expectancy estimates every year. However, the official estimates for 2019 were released in July 2022 by RGI.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Case study:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The global hunger index (GHI)</strong> of FAO captures three dimensions of hunger: insufficient availability of food, shortfalls in the nutritional status of children and child mortality (which is mainly attributable to undernutrition).</li>
<li>The 2022 index has ranked India at <strong>107 among 121 countries.</strong></li>
<li>According to the Indian government, the index is <strong>an erroneous measure of hunger and suffers from serious methodological issues.</strong></li>
<li>Three out of the four indicators used for the calculation of the index are related to the h<strong>ealth of Children and cannot be representative of the entire population</strong>.</li>
<li>The fourth and most important indicator estimate of the Proportion of the Undernourished (PoU) population is <strong>based on an opinion poll</strong> conducted on a very small sample size of 3000.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To counter the global mismatches, <strong>Indian statistical authorities</strong> must publish their own estimates proactively.</li>
<li>In order to be on time, t<strong>his can be done based even on partial data</strong>, which can be updated later. This is done in the case of <strong>GDP</strong>.</li>

<h4 id="gs-paper-2_1"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus: International Relations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/iran-saudi-deal-what-the-gambit-can-mean-for-china-west-asia-and-india-8502096/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Saudi-Iran detente/truce is China’s major geopolitical manoeuvre in West Asia and sets the stage for political influence in the region that was formerly dominated by the US.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The opening of diplomatic relations between the two</strong> came after decades of enmity and a formal cutting of ties in 2016.</li>
<li>Since 2014, the two countries had been in <strong>a proxy war in Yemen</strong>, where Iran is backing the Houthi rebels and the Saudis lead a coalition of Gulf states backed by the US.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About the Saudi-Iran deal brokered by China:</strong> The “<strong>joint trilateral statement</strong>”, signed in Beijing, includes –</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resumption of diplomatic relations</strong> and reopening of embassies and missions;</li>
<li>To respect for the sovereignty of states and the non-interference in the internal affairs of states;</li>
<li><strong>To implement the Security Cooperation Agreement (2001)</strong> and</li>
<li>To implement the General Agreement for Cooperation in <strong>Economy, Trade, Investment, Technology, Science, Culture, Sports, and Yout</strong>h (1998).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mutual Interests Drive Settlement Decision: Exploring Reasons Behind Agreement</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>For Saudi,</strong> tense relations with the Biden Administration, t<strong>he absence of American security guarantees against Iran</strong>, rapid changes in the Saudi economy (diversification) and China’s rising profile in West Asia.</li>
<li><strong>For Iran</strong>, the isolation that came with the nuclear sanctions; <strong>the Abrahamic accords</strong> (2020) – the coming together of archenemy Israel-UAE-Bahrain-Saudi; the uprising of women; normalised relations with UAE and Kuwait.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance of the deal:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No one believes this deal will end all differences between the Sunni (Saudi) monarchy and Shia (Iran) republic.</li>
<li>The deal may lead <strong>to lasting peace in Yemen</strong> and also end proxy Saudi-Iran hostilities in <strong>Lebanon, Syria</strong>, etc.</li>
<li>May develop into a <strong>four-way alignment (Saudi-Iran-China-Russia).</strong></li>
<li><strong>China is taking a new avatar</strong> – peacemaker, power broker – giving the world a new alternative to the US (blamed for instability in the region – failed miserably in Iraq, and Afghanistan).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>World’s response</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>US:</strong> Welcomed the agreement and declined the assessment of diminished US influence in the region. <strong>For example,</strong> Saudi recently concluded a deal for 121 Boeing aircraft with the US.</li>
<li><strong>Israel</strong>: A clear setback for PM Binyamin Netanyahu’s foreign policy – claiming to be the only country that could bring together an Arab-Israeli coalition against Iran.<ul>
<li><strong>The</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/08/15/israel-uae-agreement/">Abrahamic Accords</a>/the Arab-Israeli alliance, mediated by the Trump Administration, are <strong>shaken up by the Saudi-Iran agreement.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>India: Shocked</strong> by China’s (its principal adversary in a region where it has invested much diplomatic energy over the last decade) new avatar.<ul>
<li>India has always advocated dialogue and diplomacy to resolve differences.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Options available for India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cooperation</strong> rather than confrontation with China in West Asia.</li>
<li>Considering <strong>both countries have a wide range of shared interests</strong> in terms of energy security, open and free sea lanes, logistical connectivity, and most importantly, regional stability.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>China’s big-ticket diplomacy in the region is sure to impact the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/09/06/sansad-tv-diplomatic-dispatch-i2u2-summit/">I2U2 (Israel-India-UAE-US</a>) grouping.</li>
<li>It calls for India <strong>to work on its ties to the region independently of the US</strong> (for instance with Iran), and in ways that project its civilisational and cultural links and the positive contributions of the Indian diaspora.</li>

<h4 id="gs-paper-3"><strong>GS Paper 3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus: Infrastructure: Energy, Ports, Roads, Airports, Railways etc./Investment models</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/will-the-national-champions-model-of-infrastructure-development-work-8502004/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Infrastructure in emerging economies like India has seemingly become both <strong>a demonstration of good and a necessity.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Importance of Infrastructure in emerging economies:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Simultaneously works as a national aspiration good,</li>
<li>A barometer of national progress,</li>
<li>A mechanism for job creation,</li>
<li>A vehicle for crowding in private investment, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Constraints on infrastructure provision are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Expensive</strong>, because it needs to be built to a minimum scale.</li>
<li><strong>Often has a public good component,</strong> which makes the social value of infrastructure higher than its private value to individual users → <strong>making it relatively unprofitable for private investors</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>The traditional approach to financing infrastructure</strong> → tax revenues or government borrowing.</li>
<li><strong>Vicious trap</strong> → poorer economies generate less tax revenue → increasing public borrowing domestically → crowd out private investment → limits infrastructure investment, growth of the economy → keep the country poor.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Indian government’s efforts to come out of this vicious trap?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Incentivise private sector participation</strong> by providing targeted subsidies for infrastructure investments.<ul>
<li>In the early 2000s, the <strong>Public-Private-Partnership (PPP)</strong> model was introduced.</li>
<li>While the program <strong>did result in the construction of a lot of infrastructure</strong>, it ended in an avalanche of non-performing assets with public sector banks → widespread corruption → change in government in 2014.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The “national champions” model:</strong> It modified the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-economy-3/investment-models/various-investment-models/public-private-partnership-model/">PPP approach</a> by assigning the bulk of the infrastructure provisioning for roads, ports, airports, energy, and communications to a few chosen industrial houses.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How does this model overcome the difficulty of financing infrastructure?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Incentivising national champions</strong> to build the projects identified by the government.</li>
<li><strong>New aspects of the national champions model</strong>:<ul>
<li>Champions given control over existing projects with strong cash flows → helps them to achieve <strong>targeted returns and borrow</strong> from external credit markets → lowers the cost of finance, freeing up domestic savings for private investment</li>
<li>The public association of the champions with the government’s national development policy → <strong>generates a competitive advantage</strong> in getting domestic and foreign contracts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Issues with the national champions model:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>direct association of conglomerates with government policies</strong> → markets, regulators treat them as too big to fail → <strong>delayed discovery of problems</strong>, spillovers.</li>
<li>The longer it takes for projects to generate large cash flows, the greater will be the need for the state to provide <strong>access to additional cash flows</strong>.</li>
<li>This risks turning the country into an <strong>industrial oligarchy</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>An uneven playing field</strong> in terms of market access, regulatory relaxations → a significant deterrent for foreign investors → bad for <strong>efficiency and productivity at the economy-wide level</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dilemma India is facing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Can infrastructure provision be the solution to India’s growth aspirations?</li>
<li>India is at an inflection point in its development path.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong> A development model based on a domestic <strong>demand-driven production structure, powered by soft and hard infrastructure.</strong></p>

<p>A recent study in Japan found that the <strong>Sika deer living near the Kasuga Taisha Shrine and Todaiji Buddhist Templ</strong>e in the city of Nara have unique mitochondrial DNA due to a ban on their <strong>hunting for almost 1,500 years</strong>, given their status in <strong>Shintoism</strong>, Japan’s national religion.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sika deer are revered in Nara as the messengers of the Shinto gods.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Usage</strong>: Similar to Indian religious values of conservation of cultural heritage, this example can be used to show how religion can help in the conservation of flora and fauna.</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: Solicitor General <strong>drew attention to a 2005 ruling of the Supreme Court in Rameshwar Prasad v Union of India</strong> when asked whether <strong>the</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/06/23/powers-of-governor-floor-test-law-in-the-spotlight/">Governor can call for a floor test</a> <strong>in case of internal dissatisfaction within a party.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The recent Shiv Sena crisis in Maharashtra, where the Governor was criticized for using his powers to order a floor test, <strong>brought back attention to this landmark ruling</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Rameshwar Prasad v Union of India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In <strong>2005, Bihar saw a hung Legislative Assembly</strong> with no party or alliance able to reach a majority, leading to the <strong>Governor recommending</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/indian-constitution/significant-provisions/emergency-provisions/presidents-rule/">President’s Rule under Article 365</a>.</li>
<li>Later, the Governor recommended the dissolution of the Assembly, and <strong>fresh elections were announced by the</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/appointment-to-various-constitutional-posts-powers-functions-and-responsibilities-of-various-constitutional-bodies/election-commission/">Election Commission of India</a>, leading to petitions challenging the constitutionality of the dissolution of the Assembly.</li>
<li>The Supreme Court <strong>struck down the President’s Proclamation</strong> dissolving the state Assembly as unconstitutional, and though it did not restore the Assembly<strong>, it defined the contours of the Governor’s powers to dissolve the Assembly.</strong></li>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: The <strong>International Criminal Court</strong> issued an <strong>arrest warrant for war crimes for President Vladimir Putin and a second Russian official.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why did the International Criminal Court issued the warrants?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The court says <strong>Putin bears individual criminal responsibility for the abduction and deportation of Ukrainian children</strong> since Russia’s full-scale invasion.</li>
<li>The court also <strong>issued a warrant for Maria Lvova-Belova</strong>, Russia’s commissioner for children’s rights, who has <strong>been the public face of a Kremlin-sponsored program in which Ukrainian children and teenagers have been taken to Russia.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About International Criminal Court:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/09/28/international-criminal-court-3/">International Criminal Court</a> was created as a standing body to <strong>investigate war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity under a 1998</strong> treaty known as <strong>the Rome Statute</strong>.</li>
<li>Previously, the United Nations Security Council had <strong>established ad hoc tribunals to address atrocities in places such as the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.</strong></li>
<li>Based in <strong>_The Hague, a Dutch cit_y</strong> that has long been a centre for <strong>international law and justice.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What does the warrant mean for Putin?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The court <strong>cannot try defendants in absentia</strong> and <strong>Russia has said it will not surrender its own officials.</strong></li>
<li>Russia’s Foreign Ministry quickly <strong>dismissed the warrants, noting that it is not a party to the court.</strong></li>
<li>Still, the warrant for <strong>Putin’s arrest deepens his isolation in the West</strong> and could limit his movements overseas.</li>
<li>If he <strong>travels to a state that is a party to the ICC</strong>, that country must arrest him, according to its <strong>obligations under international law.</strong></li>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: For the first time in the world the <strong>Chennai-based National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT)</strong> is working at making <strong>Low-Temperature Thermal Desalination (LTTD) technology</strong> process free of emissions.</p>
<ul>
<li>An initiative of providing <strong>potable water in six islands of Lakshadweep.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Current Situation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Currently, the desalination plants, each of which provides at least <strong>100,000 litres of potable water every day, are powered by diesel generator sets.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How LTTD works:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>LTTD <strong>exploits the difference in temperature (nearly 15°C) in the ocean water at the surface and at depths of about 600 feet</strong>.</li>
<li>This cold water <strong>condenses water at the surface, which is warmer but whose pressure has been lowered using vacuum pump</strong></li>
<li>Such de-pressurised water can evaporate even at ambient temperatures and this resulting <strong>vapour when condensed is free of salts and contaminants and fit to consume.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>National Institute of Ocean Technology:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The NIOT, an institute under the <strong>aegis of the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES),</strong> has worked for years on <strong>harnessing energy from the ocean.</strong></li>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: As part of the <strong>Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative, Hyderabad-based Svaya Robotics</strong> has developed <strong>India’s first indigenous quadruped (four-legged) robot and exoskeleton for the defence sector.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>India currently <strong>imports these robots from the US and Switzerland</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About these robots:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Quadruped robots are <strong>four-legged robots</strong> which can walk or <strong>run on uneven and rough terrains.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Active exoskeletons</strong>, when worn by soldiers, can <strong>carry such heavy loads</strong> without expending much effort. Even if they are carrying 25 kg, soldiers feel as if they are carrying six or seven kg, thus <strong>they are not fatigued easily.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Both are dual-use robots and <strong>have multiple use cases in industry and healthcare as well.</strong></p>
