<p><strong>A timeline of the “Lokayukta” in Karnataka</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Karnataka Lokayukta Act, 1984</strong> came into force on January 15, 1986, and was passed with the objective of <strong>improving the standards of public administration</strong>, by looking into complaints against <strong>administrative actions, including cases of corruption, favouritism and official indiscipline in the administrative machinery.</strong></li>
<li>In 2016, <strong>an Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB)</strong> was created which issued subsequent notifications transferring the <strong>power to probe corruption cases under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, from Karnataka Lokayukta police to the ACB.</strong></li>
<li>However, in 2022, a <strong>division bench of the Karnataka High Court</strong> in “<strong>Chidananda Urs B.G vs The State of Karnataka”</strong> ordered the <strong>abolishing of ACB and the revival of an anti-corruption police unit</strong> attached to the Karnataka Lokayukta, a <strong>quasi-judicial institution that works independent of the state</strong>. Since then, the Karnataka Lokayukta’s powers have been restored.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The <strong>G-20 Foreign Ministers’ meeting</strong> in Delhi was unable to agree to a joint communique, over <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/11/editorial-analysis-lessons-from-russias-ukraine-war/">differences between Russia and the West on the war in Ukraine</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Issues that needed to be addressed  at the recent meeting:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The war in Ukraine:</strong> The G20 members accept that security issues can have a <strong>big impact on the world economy</strong> but that the G20 is <strong>not the platform to address such issues.</strong><ul>
<li><strong>The UNSC and UNGA resolution condemn Russia’s</strong> actions against Ukraine and call for its unconditional and total withdrawal from Ukrainian territory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Upholding international law that safeguards peace and stability</strong>: This includes defending the Principles enshrined in the Charter of the UN and adhering to international humanitarian law.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The principal reason for the diplomatic failure in Delhi:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The decision by Russia to <strong>walk away from the</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/11/17/as-india-takes-g20-presidency-key-takeaways-from-the-summit-in-bali/"><strong>Bali consensus</strong></a> (calling it a “thing of the past”) and China’s decision to support it.</li>
<li>Russia also feels that the meetings are about the <strong>economy, growth, development and other global challenges</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implications:</strong> Underlines the <strong>deepening great power conflict</strong> and <strong>worsening crisis of multilateralism</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Other agreements at the meeting:</strong> A number of issues of interest to India and the developing world include –</p>
<ul>
<li>Food and energy security,</li>
<li>Cooperation to counter-terrorism, climate change, global health and disaster management.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>India’s twin ambitions as G20 President:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To continue the <strong>campaign to reform multilateralism</strong> and</li>
<li>To get the world to take <strong>greater cognisance of the challenges</strong> faced by the “<strong>Global South</strong>”.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead for India as G20 President:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is clear that <strong>India cannot rely on the language of the Bali Summit.</strong></li>
<li>The Sherpas will need to <strong>craft fresh language on Ukraine</strong> – an innovative formula that considers Russian concerns as well as the western desire to condemn Russia’s conduct.</li>
<li><strong>India can leverage Quadrilateral Security Dialogue</strong> (Quad), whose foreign ministers are going to meet soon after the G20 foreign ministers’ meeting.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> As host, <strong>India is in the ‘hot seat’</strong> balancing the G7 camp on one side and the Russia-China combine on the other, to ensure that a middle path is found.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/12/07/campa-funds/#:~:text=Compensatory%20afforestation%20means%20that%20every,area%20of%20degraded%20forest%20land.">Compensatory afforestation</a> forms a significant component of various reforestation programmes being implemented in India.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>India has promised to <strong>increase its forest and tree</strong> cover to absorb an additional 2.5 – 3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent by 2030.</li>
<li>However, <strong>the forestry target is difficult to achieve</strong> due to the need for rapid industrial, infrastructure development, and urbanisation.</li>
<li>In the last 10 years, <strong>more than 1,611 square km</strong> of forest land (a third of this in the last three years) has been cleared.</li>
<li>But government data shows that <strong>total forest cover had increased by 1,540 square km</strong> in the two years between 2019 and 2021.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Programmes with compensatory afforestation component:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/02/03/green-india-mission-2/">Green India Mission</a>,</li>
<li><strong>National afforestation programme</strong></li>
<li>Tree plantation exercises along the highways and railways</li>
<li>National rural employment guarantee scheme (MGNREGS)</li>
<li>Namami Gange, etc</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is Compensatory Afforestation?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The compensatory afforestation programme</strong> ensures that forest lands getting ‘diverted’ for non-forest purposes is <strong>mandatorily accompanied by afforestation</strong> on an equal area of land.</li>
<li>It was made a legal requirement through the <strong>Compensatory Afforestation Fund (CAF) Act 2016.</strong></li>
<li>Though the law came in 2016, the concept has existed since the 1980s, as an offshoot of the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/environment-degradation-and-issues/forest-ecosystem/forest-policy-and-laws-for-forest-conservation/the-forest-conservation-act-1980/#:~:text=Enacted%20to%20check%20the%20indiscriminate,prescribing%20the%20punishment%20for%20violations.&amp;text=Working%20plans%20should%20be%20up,have%20a%20multi%2Ddimensional%20approach.">Forest Conservation Act 1980</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pushed.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pushed.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Salient provisions of the CAF Act 2016:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Newer parcels of land are earmarked for development as forests.</li>
<li>Project developers (public/private) are <strong>required to fund the entire afforestation activity</strong> on these new lands.</li>
<li>Project developers are also asked to pay for the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/09/12/net-present-value-npv/">Net Present Value (NPV)</a> <strong>of the forests</strong> being cleared, as the new lands cannot be compared with the fully grown forests getting diverted.</li>
<li>According to recent calculations, companies have to pay NPV <strong>between Rs 9.5 lakh and Rs 16 lakh per hectare</strong>, depending on the quality of forests getting diverted.</li>
<li>All this money is meant for <strong>increasing/improving the quality of forest cover</strong> in the country.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How money is disbursed for compensatory afforestation?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The money is parked in <strong>special funds</strong> created for this purpose at the Central and state levels.</li>
<li>The money is <strong>first deposited in the Central fund</strong>, from where it gets disbursed to states where the projects are located.</li>
<li>State governments prepare <strong>an annual plan of operations</strong> → approved by the Compensatory Afforestation Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) at the Central level → the state government transfers funds to the state forest departments → carry out the work.</li>
<li>The Central fund <strong>can keep up to 10% of the total money</strong> for administrative expenses.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Issues faced by the compensatory afforestation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legitimised clearing of forests</strong> and see it as an example of <strong>‘</strong><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/greenwashing.asp">greenwashing</a><strong>’</strong>.</li>
<li>Money collected before 2016 had <strong>remained largely unutilised.</strong> <strong>For example,</strong> much of the Rs 55,000 crore in the state funds remains locked.</li>
<li>Allegations of <strong>misutilisation</strong> or diversion of these funds.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of availability of suitable land/</strong>unavailability of land in a <strong>contiguous stretch</strong> remains the biggest problem.</li>
<li>Land made available for afforestation cannot be used for any other purpose and is <strong>unsuitable for growing plantations.</strong></li>
<li>Often the plantations are <strong>monocultures</strong>, which is against the core concept of <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/biodiversity/">biodiversity</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Biotic pressures</strong> – plantations face nearby human habitations and cattle.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> As the clearing of forests cannot be entirely eliminated, compensatory afforestation is a good mechanism to make up for these losses to some extent. However, the above issues need to be addressed.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> After more than a decade of negotiations, the UN members have agreed (in New York, US) on the first-ever treaty – <strong>the UN High Seas Treaty,</strong> <strong>to protect the world’s oceans outside national boundaries</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>What are the high seas?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/territorial.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/territorial.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2/3rd of the world’s oceans</strong> are currently considered international waters/high seas.</li>
<li>But until now <strong>only about 1%</strong> of these waters have been protected.</li>
<li>According to <strong>the IUCN</strong>,<ul>
<li>Nearly 10% of marine species on the high seas <strong>were found to be at risk of extinction mainly due to overfishing and pollution</strong>.</li>
<li>41% of the threatened species are also affected by <strong>climate change</strong> (more CO2 absorption, more acidic, increased marine heat waves), and deep sea <strong>mining</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For example, <strong>Dugongs</strong> used to be common marine animals but now less than 1000 remain in the wild.</li>
<li>Therefore, the issue of climate change in the sea involves implementing other global agreements such as the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/07/08/financial-and-technological-commitments-under-unfccc-and-paris-agreement/">Paris Agreement</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/global_species.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/global_species.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>What is in the High Seas Treaty?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It places <strong>30%</strong> of the world’s international waters into <strong>protected areas (MPAs) by 2030</strong>, and puts more money into marine conservation and new rules for mining at sea.</li>
<li>It also provides for <strong>–</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Arrangements for sharing marine genetic resources</strong>, such as biological material from plants and animals in the ocean.</li>
<li>Requirements for <strong>environmental assessments</strong> for deep sea activities like mining.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Richer nations have pledged money for the delivery of the treaty. <strong>For example</strong>, the EU announced nearly 820m euros (£722.3m).</li>
<li>The treaty can have <strong>benefits for society (pharmaceuticals and food)</strong> and will help <strong>reverse biodiversity losses and ensure sustainable development</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Concerns:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There were debates, particularly around <strong>what a marine protected area is</strong> – sustainable use/fully protected from fishing, shipping and exploration activities like deep-sea mining.</li>
<li>Developing nations were <strong>disappointed by the limited funding options included</strong> in the text of the treaty.</li>
<li><strong>If the MPAs are not properly connected</strong>, it might not have the desired impact as many species are migratory.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead: The treaty must be formally adopted</strong> and will enter “into force” once enough countries (~ 40) have signed and legally passed it in their own countries.</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: Scientists at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) recently outlined a potentially revolutionary new area of research called “<a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/10/28/organoids/">organoid</a> <strong>intelligence</strong>”, which aims to create <strong>“biocomputers”: where brain cultures grown in the lab are coupled to real-world sensors and input/output devices.</strong></p>
<p><strong>About Bio computers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bio computers are <strong>computing devices that use biological components</strong> such as DNA, proteins, and cells to perform computational tasks. Biocomputers use the <strong>properties of biological systems to perform computations, such as molecular recognition, self-assembly, and amplification.</strong></li>
<li>Researchers coupled the organoids with machine learning by growing the organoids <strong>inside flexible structures affixed with multiple electrodes (similar to the ones used to take EEG readings from the brain).</strong></li>
<li>These structures will be able to <strong>record the firing patterns of the neurons and also deliver electrical stimuli, to mimic sensory stimuli.</strong> The response pattern of the neurons and their effect on human behaviour or biology will then be <strong>analyzed by machine-learning techniques.</strong></li>
<li>Recently, scientists <strong>were able to grow human neurons on top of a microelectrode array</strong> that could both record and stimulate these neurons.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Opportunities for ‘bio-computers’</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>They could also <strong>help decode the pathology of drug development</strong> for devastating <strong>neurodevelopmental and degenerative diseases</strong> such as Parkinson’s disease and microcephaly.</li>
<li>Their ability to perform <strong>massively parallel computations, operate at the molecular level and potentially be more energy-efficient.</strong></li>

<p><strong>Aim of the</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/01/08/cites-washington-convention/"><strong>CITES</strong></a>: It is aimed at ensuring that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten the survival of the species.</p>
<ul>
<li>It accords varying degrees of <strong>protection to over 37,000 species of animals and plants</strong>, listed in three Appendices, depending on their level of threat (see infographic).</li>
<li>It is further expanded into the <strong>conservation of marine life and oceans,</strong> and on collaborating with businesses and funding conservation activities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Permit System:</strong> All import, export and re-export of species covered under CITES must be authorised through a permit system.</p>
<p><strong>COP</strong>: Every two years, the Conference of the Parties (CoP), the <strong>supreme decision-making body of CITES,</strong> applies a set of biological and trade criteria to evaluate proposals from parties to decide if a species should be in Appendix I or II.</p>
