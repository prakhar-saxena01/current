<h4 id="gs-paper-1"><strong>GS Paper 1</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/california-atmospheric-rivers-drought-floods-fires-8511428/">Indian Express</a></p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: California has experienced an exceptionally <strong>wet winter with 11 atmospheric rivers battering the state</strong> and a twelfth such storm <strong>threatening to cause even more flooding, landslides and road closures.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>California has received <strong>147% of average rainfall</strong> so far this season, <strong>according to the state Department of Water Resources.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About</strong> <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/stories/what-are-atmospheric-rivers">Atmospheric rivers</a><strong>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Atmospheric rivers are <strong>vast airborne currents of dense moisture carried aloft for hundreds of miles from the Ocean</strong> and funnelled over <strong>land to fall as bouts of heavy rain and snow.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/atmostpheric-river.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/atmostpheric-river.jpg?is-pending-load=1" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>California prone to drought:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>During any <strong>normal 20-year period of the 20th century, about 10 years were wet and 10 years were dry.</strong></li>
<li>But in the past 25 years, <strong>only nine years were wet and 16 were dry</strong>, meaning the state needs seven more wet years to recover. And <strong>climate change points to future years that are likely to get warmer, exacerbating the increasingly dry climate.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How does the rain affect wildfires?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This winter’s bountiful rainfall has already <strong>triggered considerable growth in grasses and scrub that will dry out by summer, leaving a larger, thicker fuel bed for wildfires.</strong></li>
<li>The heavy rains can create <strong>dangers around burn scars from previous wildfires</strong>. The denuded land becomes susceptible to mudslides.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impacts on regional climate and people:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Heat balance</strong>: They transport huge amounts of water vapour from one place to another which is essential for the transfer of heat and equalizing heat across various latitudes.</li>
<li><strong>Precipitation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Climate change</strong>: They are being amplified by global warming as they are predicted to grow longer, wetter and wider in a warming climate.</li>
<li><strong>People</strong>:<ul>
<li><strong>Pros</strong>: In dry conditions, atmospheric rivers can replenish water supplies and quench dangerous wildfires.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>They can also deliver the usually needed rainfall to a region which is necessary for human life.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cons</strong>: In wet conditions, they can cause damaging floods and debris flow, wreaking havoc on local economies.</li>
<li><strong>Visibility</strong> is also diminished as these rivers increase haze-fog conditions which harm agriculture and transport.</li>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: The Supreme Court asked the Centre to <strong>provide data that may point to a more dignified,</strong> <strong>less painful and socially acceptable</strong> method of executing prisoners other than death by hanging.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Bench has sought <strong>fresh data to substantiate the argument that a more humane means of execution can be found.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Death penalty:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/06/04/insights-editorial-analysis-the-challenge-of-reforming-death-penalty/">The death penalty</a>, <strong>also known as capital punishment</strong>, is a legal sentence in some countries where a <strong>person is put to death by the state as a punishment for a crime they have committed.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Section 354 (5) of the Code of Criminal Procedure</strong> mandates that a person sentenced to death shall <strong>“be hanged by the neck till he is dead”.</strong></li>

<p><strong>Judgements related to death sentences:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There are two leading judgments on the issue — <strong>Bachan Singh vs the State of Punjab (1980), which upheld the death penalty,</strong> but limited it to the ‘rarest of rare cases’, and</li>
<li><strong>Deena Dayal vs Union of India and Others (1983), upheld the method</strong> by ruling that <strong>hanging is “as painless as possible” and “causes no greater pain than any other known method”.</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>35th Report of the Law Commission (1967)</strong> noted that <strong>electrocution, the use of a gas chamber and lethal injection</strong> were considered by some to be less painful.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Centre’s stand on death by hanging:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In its 2018 affidavit, the government argued that <strong>death by hanging was the only “viable” option to execute a death warrant</strong>. However, the <strong>government also sought additional time to examine the methods followed in other countries.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the practice in other countries?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>According to Amnesty International<strong>, 55 countries around the world have the death sentence on the books</strong>.</li>
<li>In the United States, an i<strong>ntravenous lethal injection is given in every state (27 states and American Samoa) that allows the death penalty.</strong> Electrocution is a secondary method in some states.</li>
<li><strong>Execution by firing squad is employed in China and Saudi Arabia</strong> uses beheading apart from other methods.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The question of whether or not India’s democratic values have declined in recent years has been debated at the University of Cambridge.</p>
<p><strong>Data on democratic values in India</strong>: By the Sweden-based V-Dem (Varieties of Democracy) Institute –</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The deliberative democracy index:</strong> It measures whether political decisions are made through public reasoning or emotional appeals and coercion.</li>
<li><strong>The egalitarian democracy index:</strong> It examines equal access to rights and liberties.</li>
<li><strong>The electoral democracy index:</strong> It evaluates election cleanliness and lack of fraud.</li>
<li><strong>The liberal democracy index:</strong> It measures the protection of individual and minority rights against state tyranny.</li>
<li><strong>The participatory democracy index:</strong> It measures active citizen engagement in electoral and non-electoral political processes.</li>
<li>The values of these indexes have been declining, and <strong>in 2022 they reached the levels last seen during the 1975 Emergency.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Some incidents depicting declining democratic values in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The arrest of citizens for posting online content critical of the government.</li>
<li>The shutdown of domestic access to the Internet.</li>
<li>The government <strong>censored</strong> political information on the Internet.</li>
<li>Allegations of the government using <strong>social media to disseminate misleading/false information</strong> to influence the population.</li>

<p><strong>Context: Recently,</strong> <a href="https://www.unesco.org/reports/wwdr/2023/en"><strong>‘United Nations World Water Development Report 2023: partnerships and cooperation for water’</strong></a>, was released. Also, UN 2023 Water Conference is currently being held in New York</p>
<p><strong>Major findings of the report:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Global:</strong><ul>
<li>Globally, two billion people do not have safe drinking water and 3.6 billion lack access to safely managed sanitation</li>
<li><strong>The global urban population facing water scarcity</strong> is projected to increase from <strong>one-third (2016) to nearly half</strong> of the global urban population in 2050, with India projected to be the most severely affected.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>India:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>80% of people living under water stress</strong> lived in Asia; in particular, northeast China, as well as India and Pakistan.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Smart management and conservation</strong> of the world’s water resources means bringing together governments, businesses, scientists, civil society and communities – including indigenous communities – to design and deliver concrete solutions.”</li>
<li><strong>Water-energy-food nexus</strong> is critical in a transboundary context E.g. transboundary water cooperation arrangement established by the <strong>Mahakali Treaty (Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project)</strong> between <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/06/editorial-analysis-stabilizing-ties-with-nepal-in-uncertain-times/">India and Nepal</a>, which aims to achieve water and energy security for both parties.</li>
<li>Partnerships that focus on <strong>knowledge co-creation instead of knowledge transfer</strong> aim to embrace the diversity of expertise and experience within a knowledge system.</li>
<li>Water resources management practices should incorporate traditional elements: E.g. <strong>paar systems in western Rajasthan, India, and amunas</strong> in Peru</li>
<li><strong>Use of technology:</strong>g., Google began a <strong>flood forecasting initiative</strong> in 2018, with the goal of preventing catastrophic damage</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Addressing <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Impact-of-Digital-Economy-on-Women-in-India.pdf">India’s digital gender divide</a> will enable the Indian economy to achieve more inclusive growth in the long term.</p>
<p><strong>Data related to India’s digital gender divide:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>National Family Health Survey (2019-21):</strong> One in three women in India (33%) have ever used the internet, compared to more than half (57%) of men [Rural India – 49% vs 25%].</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Gendered barriers that need to be addressed:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lack of access:</strong> Low levels of infrastructure, coverage and smartphone penetration → gender inequality → low access to digital devices and services.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Solution: Bridging the access gap</strong> (especially in rural areas) by<ul>
<li>Enabling smartphone and internet access through wider connectivity and penetration in rural areas,</li>
<li>Providing affordable solutions and educating households on the benefits of digital access.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Digital illiteracy:</strong> Inequality in functional literacy → Overall 59% (66% in rural areas) of women between 15-49 years have not completed 10 or more years of schooling → <strong>often cannot make optimum use of smartphones</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Solution:</strong> Digital education would help this large cohort leapfrog the traditional development gender divide.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cyber safety and security:</strong> Women may be <strong>more vulnerable to online harassment, cyberbullying and cyberstalking</strong> → which in turn widens the digital divide.</p>
<p><strong>Areas that can play a catalytic role in bridging the gender digital divide:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Designing digital solutions to advance gender equity:</strong> The involvement of girls and women in co-creation will accelerate digital adoption and help reduce the digital gender divide.</li>
<li><strong>Digital literacy and capacity building:</strong> Early access to digital technology to absorb new knowledge and skills → essential for employability → higher earning, and economic opportunities.</li>
<li><strong>Responsible technology:</strong> Protecting user privacy and data must be a top priority → stakeholders in the technology industry and the government need to collaborate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Indian government’s Initiatives in this direction:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2017/02/14/air-spotlight-summary-pradhan-mantri-gramin-digital-saksharta-abhiyan/">PM Gramin Digital Saksharta Abhiyan</a> under the vision of Digital India. It specifically targets the rural population, with 60 million households covered.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/08/28/national-digital-library-of-india/">The National Digital Library</a> for children and adolescents proposed in the UB for 2023-24 will ensure equitable access to quality education and improve digital literacy levels.</li>
<li><strong>The ‘Stay Safe Online’ campaign</strong> by MeitY, conceptualised as part of <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/07/editorial-analysis-indias-g20-presidency/">India’s G20 presidency</a>, will prioritize awareness creation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong> India is home to the <strong>largest number of women</strong> (~691 million) <strong>in the world</strong> → opportunities for women to contribute, participate and innovate in this ever-expanding and dynamic digital ethos.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>With its position at the G20’s helm and drive towards a trillion-dollar-plus digital economy, the country has its building blocks in place to be <strong>at the forefront of the next digital revolution.</strong></li>
<li>With the stage for a <strong>transformative</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/08/the-importance-of-women-led-digital-solutions/">and gender-equal digital revolution</a> been set, India must take advantage of the mutually reinforcing forces of socioeconomic and digital empowerment.</li>

<h4 id="gs-paper-2_3"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Issues Relating to Development and Management of Social Sector/Services relating to Health</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/the-road-to-ending-tuberculosis/article66649256.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The existing target of <strong>ending tuberculosis (TB) by 2030</strong> lacks implementation and clarity about definitions of “end”.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In <strong>1993</strong>, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared TB a global health emergency.</li>
<li>Founded in 2001, <strong>the Stop TB Partnership</strong> (a UN-hosted organisation) takes bold and smart risks to serve the needs and amplify the voices of the people, communities, and countries affected by TB.<ul>
<li>The Stop TB board meets in Varanasi, India, and will coincide with World TB Day 2023 (March 24).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria</strong> (2002) began disbursing money directed towards the global TB epidemic in 2003.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Current obstacles in the global fight against TB:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The response has been short on urgency and long on processes.</li>
<li>For example, The Global Fund r<strong>emains hostage to the zero-sum games</strong> imposed by donors and the champions of the three diseases.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key areas that remain under-served:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Development and wide use of an adult TB vaccine:</strong> The current vaccine is delivered at birth.</li>
<li><strong>Getting newer therapeutic agents for TB</strong>.<ul>
<li>Moving to an injection-free and shorter all-oral pills regimen for TB (the current standard is for at least six months) will improve compliance and reduce patient fatigue.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The space of diagnostics.</strong> There are exciting developments for use of AI-assisted handheld radiology with 90-second reporting and 95% plus accuracy for diagnosing TB.<ul>
<li>This is a mature technology and should be rolled out universally immediately.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best practices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The COVID-19 vaccine development process</strong> shows what can be done with the help of collective will and action.</li>
<li>India convened the <strong>InDx</strong> diagnostics coalition in Bengaluru for COVID-19.</li>
<li><strong>TN-KET (Tamil Nadu Kasanoi Erappila Thittam/TB death-free project)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/savings.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/savings.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Using <strong>social safety programmes</strong> to address the poverty drivers of the TB epidemic.</li>
<li>Leveraging the <strong>mobile and computational data revolution</strong> to improve treatment outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>India’s leadership of the G20</strong> and the focus on health could be catalytic, in the same manner, that the Japanese G7 presidency in 2001 was for the creation of the Global Fund.</li>
<li>Providing historical symmetry, Japan leads the G7 in 2023, <strong>providing leaders of both nations and groupings to act synergistically towards ending TB.</strong></li>

<p><strong>What is CBAM or Carbon Tax?</strong></p>
<p>It is a tax that imposes importers and non-EU manufacturers to pay for the carbon emission linked to the goods they sell within EU limits.</p>
<ul>
<li>Under the political agreement, the CBAM will <strong>enter into force in its transitional phase as of 1 October 2023</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Similar plans in the US:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Inflation Reduction Act</strong> will allow the US to join with or mirror the EU’s plan to impose a carbon fee on imports of high-emitting goods.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Importance:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It seeks to <strong>impose tariffs on imports</strong> with a high carbon footprint entering the 27-member bloc.</li>
<li>Encourage cleaner industrial production in non-EU countries</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implication for India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Indian exports (India exports about <strong>$2 billion worth</strong> of products annually to the EU) could attract a <strong>20-35% duty</strong> on key Indian shipments, potentially clouding free trade talks between the two sides</li>
<li>Against the principle of <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/11/28/common-but-differentiated-responsibilities-and-respective-capabilities-cbdr-rc/"><strong>Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities.</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>India is considering imposing <strong>retaliatory tariffs on EU imports</strong> in response to CBAM, which India said is discriminatory towards developing nations.</p>
<p><strong>What is Carbon Leakage?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Carbon leakage</strong> refers to a situation where <strong>efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions</strong> in one country or region are offset by increased emissions in another country or region with less strict emissions regulations.</p>
<p>This occurs when <strong>companies move their production or operations to countries with weaker environmental regulations</strong> in order to avoid the costs associated with reducing emissions.</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: The Union Minister of Ports, Shipping &amp; Waterways in India has announced the launch of the <strong>Green Tug Transition Programme (GTTP)</strong> with the aim of making India a global hub for green shipbuilding by 2030.</p>
<p><strong>Features</strong>: The programme will start with <strong>Green Hybrid Tugs</strong>, which will be powered by <strong>green hybrid propulsion systems</strong>, and will subsequently adopt <strong>non-fossil fuel solutions</strong> like Methanol, Ammonia, and Hydrogen.</p>
<p><strong>What is Green Shipping?</strong></p>
<p>Green shipping refers to the use of environment-friendly resources and energy to transport people and goods by ship</p>
<ul>
<li>Green ship technology adopts procedures to decrease emissions, consume less energy, and be more efficient.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are Tugs?</strong></p>
<p>Tugs are special boats that assist other vessels into and out of port. The primary purpose of these boats is to help move larger ships by towing, pushing, and guiding.</p>
<p>Also, India’s first <strong>National Centre of Excellence in Green Port &amp; Shipping (NCoEGPS</strong>) was inaugurated recently in Gurugram, Haryana.</p>
<ul>
<li>Collaboration between the <strong>Ministry of Ports, Shipping &amp; Waterways, Government of India and the Energy and Resources Institute (TERI).</strong></li>
<li>NCoEGPS acts as the <strong>Nodal entity for the industr</strong></li>
