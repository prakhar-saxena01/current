<h4 id="gs-paper-1"><strong>GS Paper 1</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Important Geophysical Phenomena</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/without-action-plans-indias-poorest-will-continue-to-bear-brunt-of-heatwaves-study/article66668156.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> A new report by the think-tank Centre for Policy Research on <strong>“How is India Adapting to Heatwaves?</strong>” indicates that the country is ill-prepared to face the heat.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Landmark heatwaves (1998, 2002, 2010, 2015, 2022) have <strong>led to large death tolls and extensive economic damage</strong> by reducing labour productivity and affecting water availability, agriculture and energy systems.</li>
<li>Governments across India have responded by creating <strong>heat action plans</strong> (HAPs), which prescribe a variety of measures (to decrease the impact of heatwaves) –<ul>
<li>Preparatory activities</li>
<li>Post-heatwave response</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The report analysed <strong>37 HAPs</strong> at the city (9), district (13) and State (15) levels across 18 States, to evaluate how policy action is keeping up with the warming weather in India.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Findings of the report:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/04/07/what-are-heat-waves/"><strong>Heat waves</strong></a> (prolonged periods of extreme heat) <strong>have increased in frequency</strong> in recent decades due to <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/climate-change-and-associated-issues/">climate change</a>.</li>
<li>HAPs are not built for local contexts.</li>
<li>Nearly all HAPs –<ul>
<li>Fail to identify and target vulnerable groups</li>
<li>Are <strong>underfunded</strong> with weak legal foundations → reduces bureaucratic incentives to prioritise and comply with HAPs instructions</li>
<li>Are insufficiently transparent</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Only 2 HAPs carry out and present <strong>vulnerability assessments</strong> (systematic studies to locate where the people most likely to be affected are in a city, district, or State).</li>
<li>There is <strong>no national repository of HAPs</strong> and very few HAPs are listed online.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>HAPs must identify sources of financing</strong> – either from new funds or by combining actions with existing national and State policies.</li>
<li>Set up <strong>rigorous independent evaluation</strong>s as a basis for constant improvement.</li>
<li><strong>Raise public awareness</strong> on issues related to environmental sustainability and climate change.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Without implementation-oriented HAPs, India’s poorest will continue to suffer from extreme heat, paying with both their health and incomes.</p>

<p><strong>Syllabus: Governance: RTI</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-gives-states-uts-and-high-courts-three-months-to-set-up-online-rti-portals/article66660885.ece#:~:text=The%20Supreme%20Court%20has%20directed,to%20ensure%20transparency%20in%20governance."><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Supreme Court has directed <strong>States and Union Territories</strong> to set up and operationalize <strong>online</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/governance/governance-important-aspects/transparency/right-to-information-act/"><strong>Right to Information</strong></a> <strong>(RTI) portals</strong> within three months to <strong>ensure transparency in governance.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is RTI?</strong></p>
<p>The Right to Information Act 2005 (RTI) gives <strong>Indian citizens the right to access information held by public authorities (</strong>all levels of government, judiciary, as well as any non-governmental organizations that receive public funding).</p>
<p><strong>Genesis of RTI act:</strong></p>
<p>In 1986, the Indian Supreme Court ruled in the <strong>case of Mr Kulwal v/s Jaipur Municipal Corporation</strong> that the freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under <strong>Article 19</strong> of the Indian Constitution includes the right to information.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/rti_act.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/rti_act.jpg?is-pending-load=1" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Why Online Portal?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 6(1) of RTI, 2005</strong> stipulated that an information seeker had a <strong>statutory right to move an application through electronic means</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Issues with the online portal:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Even after 17 years of the act being passed, <strong>several High Courts and most district courts</strong> entertain <strong>only physical RTI applications</strong>.</li>
<li>Issues of the <strong>‘</strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/science-technology/communication-and-it-technology/digital-divide/#:~:text=Digital%20divide%20is%20any%20uneven,or%20geopolitical%20criteria%2C%20or%20otherwise."><strong>digital divide’</strong></a>, <strong>lack of digital infrastructure</strong>, and <strong>lack of digital literacy</strong> hamper RTI progress.</li>
</ul>
<p>Recently, <strong>Supreme Court and some HCs in Madhya Pradesh</strong>, Odisha, and Delhi have set up an online portal facilitating requests for the supply of information.</p>
<p><strong>More about Section 6 of the RTI Act</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A person who desires to obtain any information under this Act can do so <strong>in writing or through electronic means.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Language:</strong>English/Hindi/official language of the area</li>
<li><strong>Fee</strong>: Prescribed fee.<ul>
<li><strong>No need to disclose the reasons</strong>: For making the request or their personal details except for such information that might be required for contacting them.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Supreme Court of India has ruled that an “affinity test,” which measures an applicant’s knowledge of a particular tribe or caste’s customs, rituals, and other traits, cannot be the sole determinant of a caste or tribe claim.</p>
<p><strong>What is an affinity test?</strong></p>
<p>An affinity test is a study on caste/tribe claims based on the <strong>peculiar anthropological and ethnological traits, deities, rituals, customs, mode of marriage</strong>, death ceremonies, methods of burial of dead bodies, etc., of a particular caste or tribe, as well as the applicant’s knowledge of them.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is used as a means to <strong>corroborate the documentary evidence submitted</strong> by the applicant in support of their caste or tribe claim.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why affinity test can’t be the sole criterion?</strong></p>
<p><strong>An applicant’s knowledge of SC/ST traits may not be an accurate measure</strong> of his or her belonging to a particular caste or tribe, as <strong>he or she may have learned these traits from other sources</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Also,  if the applicant has stayed in urban areas outside his community for decades, the applicant may not know the facts</li>
<li>The court recognized that the <strong>test can be helpful</strong>, but it cannot be conclusive proof of caste or tribe status.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance of the ruling:</strong> The court’s ruling resolves conflicting views on the use of affinity tests to determine caste or tribe status.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Coffee Board has issued an advisory to coffee farmers to tackle the attack of berry borer in Robusta coffee plants.</p>
<p><strong>What is Berry borer infestation?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Berry borer infestation is a common problem</strong> in coffee production. It is caused by a small beetle called the coffee berry borer, which lays its eggs inside coffee berries.</p>
<p><strong>Measures to control it:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The berry borer-infested gleanings, leftover fruits, and off-season berries</strong> should be collected and disposed of by burning or burying them in the soil or disinfested by dipping them in boiling water to mitigate the attack in the next season</li>
<li><strong>Brocca traps,</strong> an effective measure to control the berry borer population in coffee plantations, should be installed and backing irrigation should be provided for Robusta coffee plants.</li>

<p>It involves beaming tiny microscopic pellets at a spacecraft to propel it through space, instead of using traditional chemical-fuelled rockets. The propulsion system requires two spacecraft:</p>

<td>It will <strong>shoot a beam of tiny microscopic particles</strong> at the interstellar spacecraft, which would be <strong>heated up by lasers</strong>, causing part of them to melt into plasma that accelerates the pellets further, a process known <strong>as laser ablation</strong></td>
<td>The heated pellets could reach 120 km/second and either <strong>hit the sail of the interstellar spacecraft or repel a magnet within it</strong>, helping to <strong>propel</strong> the spacecraft to huge speeds</td>

<p><strong>The pellet-beam concept was partly inspired</strong> by the <strong>Breakthrough Starshot initiative</strong>, which is working on a ‘light-sail’ propulsion system.</p>
<p>NASA is developing <strong>bimodal nuclear propulsion</strong> – a two-part system consisting of Nuclear Thermal and Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NTP and NEP element; therefore ‘bimodal’) – that could enable transits to <strong>Mars in just 45 days</strong></p>

<p><strong>Source: TH</strong></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> A team of marine biologists (working in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands) have stumbled upon a piece of rock (Plastiglomerate) made from plastic from a beach on Aves Island.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is the first such find from India.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is plastiglomerate?</strong></p>
<p>It is a rock composed of sand, rock fragments, shells and other materials held together by plastic. It is a new form of <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/environment-pollution-and-control/waste-management/plastic-waste/"><strong>plastic pollution</strong></a>, which scientists described in 2014.</p>
<ul>
<li>Laboratory analysis showed that it was made of two very commonly used plastic polymers, <strong>polyethene and polyvinyl chloride</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Aves Island:</strong></p>
<p>Aves Island is an island of the Andaman Islands. It belongs to the North and Middle Andaman administrative district, part of the Indian union territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The island lies <strong>140 km north of Port Blair</strong></p>
<p>According to the 2011 Census, <strong>there are just two people on Aves Island</strong>. Both are male.</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Southern Ocean that encircles Antarctica</strong> covers around 10% of the global ocean and is home to nearly 10,000 unique polar species.</li>
<li><strong>Climate change and commercial fishing are altering habitats</strong> such as sea ice and the sheltered seafloor under ice shelves that are home to a variety of species.</li>

<li><strong>The UN 30×30 Framework</strong> (reached at the COP15 to the CBD in 2022) aims to protect 30% of the world’s land and sea.</li>
<li><strong>The Southern Ocean has 2 MPAs</strong> – one in the southern shelf of the South Orkney Islands and the other in the Ross Sea – <strong>protecting only 5% of the ocean</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MPAs in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MPA</strong> is a defined region managed for the long-term conservation of marine resources, ecosystem services or cultural heritage.</li>
<li>There are a total of <strong>31 major MPAs in India</strong> (as of Feb 2022) covering coastal areas that have been notified under <strong>Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.</strong></li>
