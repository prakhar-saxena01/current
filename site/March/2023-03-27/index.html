<h4 id="gs-paper-2"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Important International Institutions, agencies and fora – their Structure, Mandate</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/explained-understanding-imf-bailouts/article66665548.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/international-relations/important-international-institutions-agencies-and-further-structure-mandate-etc/imf/">International Monetary Fund (IMF)</a> confirmed a $3 billion bailout plan for Sri Lanka’s struggling economy and is also in negotiations with Pakistan for a $1.1 billion bailout plan.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The IMF was set up in <strong>1945: as</strong> an outcome of the <strong>Bretton Woods conference</strong>.</li>
<li>The primary goal of the IMF back then was <strong>to bring about international economic coordination to prevent competing currency devaluation</strong> by countries trying to promote their own exports.</li>
<li>Eventually, the <strong>IMF evolved to be a lender of last resort</strong> to governments of countries that had to deal with severe currency crises.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why do nations seek an IMF bailout?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Central banks mismanagement</strong> → forced by governments (populist spending) → create fresh money → rapid rise in the money supply → prices rise → exchange value of the currency drops → destroy confidence in the currency.</li>
<li><strong>A country’s domestic economic policies</strong> (that imperil productivity) can also have an adverse impact on its currency’s exchange rate and foreign exchange reserves.</li>
<li><strong>Bad luck can also contribute to a crisis</strong>. For example, <strong>a decrease in foreign tourists visiting Sri Lanka</strong> led to a steep fall in the flow of U.S. dollars into the nation.</li>
<li>In such a scenario, many countries (facing a major macroeconomic risk/currency crisis) are forced to seek help from the IMF <strong>to meet their external debt and other obligations</strong>, to purchase essential imports, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How does the IMF help countries?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The IMF basically lends money, often in the form of <strong>special drawing rights (SDRs)</strong>, to troubled economies through a number of its lending programs such as the<ul>
<li>The extended credit facility,</li>
<li>A flexible credit line,</li>
<li>Stand-by agreement, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SDRs simply <strong>represent a basket of five currencies</strong>, namely the U.S. dollar, the euro, the Chinese yuan, the Japanese yen, and the British pound.</li>
<li>Countries can use the SDRs <strong>for various purposes</strong> depending on their individual circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Strings attached to an IMF bailout:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The IMF usually imposes <strong>conditions on countries</strong> before it lends any money to them.</li>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> a country may have <strong>to implement certain structural reforms</strong> as a condition to receive IMF loans.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Pros and Cons of IMF’s conditional lending :</strong></p>

<p>●       It resulted from <strong>a balance of payments deficit</strong> due to excess reliance on imports and other external factors.</p>
<p>●       The Government of India’s <strong>immediate response was to secure an emergency loan of $2.2 billion from the IMF</strong> by pledging 67 tons of India’s gold reserves as collateral security.</p>
<p>●       The crisis paved the way for the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2014/12/14/effects-liberalization-indian-economy-society/">liberalisation of the Indian economy</a>, since one of the conditions stipulated in the World Bank and IMF loan (structural reform), required India to open its economy.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> A Parliamentary panel report ‘<strong>Promotion and Regulation of E-Commerce in India</strong>’ suggested that a <strong>national e-commerce policy needs to be notified by the Government at the earliest</strong> as the absence of a dedicated policy had resulted in <strong>fragmented and ineffective regulation and created a strategy vacuum for the sector</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>About e-Commerce:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Electronic commerce or e-commerce is a business model <strong>that lets firms and individuals buy and sell things over the Internet.</strong></li>

<p><strong>Need for the policy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure <strong>protection of consumer rights and privacy</strong> and include <strong>anti-counterfeiting, and anti-piracy measures.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Suggestions given:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pro-customer framework</strong></li>
<li><strong>Skill development strategy –</strong> by gauging the various requirements in the e-commerce value chains.</li>
<li>Proposed framing of suitable <strong>social security schemes related to insurance, working conditions, disability and other benefits by the government</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Appropriate</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/07/20/sansad-tv-bills-an-insight-new-labour-laws/">labour laws</a> <strong>relating to working hours, and holidays. minimum pay, etc., for gig and platform workers, should be framed and e-commerce</strong> must be mandated to extend these benefits,</li>
<li>The committee further recommended that the DPIIT should develop appropriate mechanisms for the <strong>enforcement of rules related</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/05/20/sansad-tv-committee-report-intellectual-property-rights-regime/">to Intellectual Property Rights</a> <strong>in the e-commerce space in consultation with the relevant Ministries/Departments.</strong></li>
<li>Need to <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/12/05/centre-stops-online-sale-of-medicines/">notify e-pharmacy rules</a> and formulate comprehensive guidelines with regard to e-pharmacy/e-health platforms.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) in its report suggested that India should target <strong>USD 350 billion worth of goods exported through e-commerce by 2030</strong></p>
<p>India’s current e-commerce export numbers remain far below their potential. Currently, e-<strong>commerce exports account for only USD 2 billion, less than 0.5 per cent of the country’s total goods export basket.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suggestions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Government should issue a <strong>separate e-commerce export policy</strong>. Such <strong>policies in countries including China, Korea, Japan, and Vietnam, have helped many firms sell globally.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Redefining responsibilities of sellers; simplifying payment reconciliation and processes; developing business ecosystem</strong>; and setting up a <strong>National Trade Network</strong> for the medium.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> A UK-based startup claims to have developed a technology – “biotransformation” – that could alter the state of plastics and make them biodegradable.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>India generates <strong>5 billion kgs of plastic waste annually</strong> and the per capita plastic waste generation has also doubled in the past five years.</li>
<li>The Indian government –<ul>
<li>Introduced a <strong>plastic waste management gazette</strong> to help tackle the ever-growing plastic pollution caused by single-use plastics.</li>
<li>Imposed a <strong>ban on single-use plastics</strong> to bring a stop to their use in the country.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The National Dashboard</strong> on Elimination of Single-Use Plastic and Plastic Waste Management brings all stakeholders together to track the progress made.</li>
<li>An <strong>Extended Producer Responsibility</strong> (EPR) portal helps in facilitating ease of compliance reporting in relation to EPR obligations of the producers, importers and brand-owners.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is Biotransformation technology?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is <strong>a novel technology</strong> that would digest plastic waste naturally with the help of microbes and biodegrade the waste without leaving behind any microplastics.</li>
<li><strong>Food packaging and healthcare industries</strong> are the two prime sectors that could use this technology to reduce waste.</li>
<li>This will ensure that plastics escaping refuse streams are <strong>processed efficiently and broken down.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Alternatives to reduce plastic waste:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A switch to <strong>jute or paper-based packaging</strong> could potentially cut down plastic waste.</li>
<li><strong>The Government of Tamil Nadu</strong> showcased alternatives made using coir, bagasse, rice and wheat bran, etc.</li>

<h3 id="weapons-containing-depleted-uranium"><strong>Weapons containing depleted uranium</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/britain-depleted-uranium-ukraine-explained-8520252/">Indian Express</a></p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: British government recently said that it would <strong>provide Ukraine with armour-piercing rounds containing depleted uranium</strong>.</p>
<p>Though they aren’t considered nuclear weapons, <strong>they emit low levels of radiation and can cause severe diseases.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is depleted uranium?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Depleted uranium is a <strong>by-product of the process of creating enriched uranium</strong>, which is used in <strong>nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons</strong>. In comparison to enriched uranium, depleted uranium is <strong>much less radioactive and is incapable of generating a nuclear reaction</strong>.</li>
<li>However, due to its high density — <strong>it’s denser than lead — depleted uranium is widely used in weapons as it can easily penetrate armour plating.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Which countries have depleted uranium munitions?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Apart from the <strong>US, Britain, Russia, China, France and Pakistan</strong> produce uranium weapons, which are <strong>not classified as nuclear weapons, as per the International Coalition to Ban Uranium Weapons</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are the risks of using such weapons?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ingesting or inhaling quantities of uranium</strong> – even depleted uranium – is dangerous: it depresses renal function and raises the risk of developing a range of cancers.</li>
<li>Moreover, <strong>according to the International Coalition to Ban Uranium Weapons, depleted uranium munitions which miss their target can poison groundwater and soil.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Where have depleted uranium munitions been used?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1991 Gulf War to destroy T-72 tanks in Iraq</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia and,</strong></li>
<li><strong>During the 2003 invasion of Iraq.</strong></li>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: The government recently launched the <strong>Aravalli Green Wall Project</strong>, a major <strong>initiative to green the 5 km buffer area around the Aravalli Hill Range</strong> in <strong>four states</strong> at a function organised to celebrate the International Day of Forests in Haryana.</p>
<p><strong>About Aravalli Green Wall Project</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Aravalli Green Wall Project is <strong>part of the Union Environment Ministry’s vision</strong> to create green <strong>corridors across the country to combat land degradation and</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/environment-degradation-and-issues/desertification/#:~:text=Desertification%20is%20the%20process%20by,and%20dry%20sub%2Dhumid%20areas.">desertification</a><strong>. The project covers the states of Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Delhi</strong> – where the Aravalli hills landscape span over 6 million hectares of land.</li>
<li>The project will <strong>involve planting native species of trees and shrubs on scrubland, wasteland and degraded forest land, along with rejuvenating and restoring surface water bodies such as ponds, lakes and streams.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improve the <strong>ecological health of the Aravalli range</strong></li>
<li><strong>Prevent the eastward expansion of the Thar Desert</strong> and reduce <strong>land degradation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>help in <strong>carbon sequestration and mitigate climate change</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Promote sustainable development and livelihood opportunities</strong> by involving local communities in afforestation, agro-forestry and water conservation activities that will generate income, employment, food security and social benefits.</li>
<li><strong>Contribute to India’s commitments under various international conventions</strong> such as <strong>UNCCD</strong> (United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification), CBD (Convention on Biological Diversity) and <strong>UNFCCC</strong> (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change).</li>
