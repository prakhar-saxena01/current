<p><strong>Syllabus: Role of NGOs</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/fcra-licence-of-think-tank-cpr-suspended-what-is-fcra-8473866/"><strong>Indian Express</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Centre <strong>suspended the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) license</strong> of the Centre for Policy Research (CPR) following <strong>prima facie inputs regarding the violation of funding norms.</strong></p>
<p><strong>About CPR:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Government of India <strong>recognizes CPR as a not-for-profit society</strong> and contributions to the Centre are tax-exempt – according to its website.</li>
<li>CPR receives grants from the <strong>Indian Council for Social Science Research (ICSSR) and is a Department of Science and Technology-recognized institution.</strong></li>
<li>CPR receives grants from a variety of domestic and international sources, including foundations, corporate philanthropy, governments, and multilateral agencies.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the FCRA?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The FCRA was enacted <strong>during the Emergency in 1976</strong> amid apprehensions that foreign powers were interfering in India’s affairs by pumping money into the country through independent organizations.</li>
<li>The law sought to <strong>regulate foreign donations to individuals and associations</strong>.</li>
<li>An <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/05/12/foreign-contribution-regulation-act-2010-2/">amended FCRA was enacted in 2010</a> to “consolidate the law” on the <strong>utilization of foreign funds, and “to prohibit” their use for “any activities detrimental to the national interest”.</strong></li>
<li>The law was amended again in <strong>2020, giving the government tighter control and scrutiny over the receipt and utilization of foreign funds by NGOs.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/FCRA.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/FCRA.jpg?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p>FCRA requires every person or NGO <strong>seeking to receive foreign donations to be</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>registered under the Act,</li>
<li>to open a bank account for the receipt of foreign funds in the State Bank of India, Delhi, and</li>
<li>to utilize those funds only for the purpose for which they have been received and as stipulated in the Act.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Act prohibits the receipt of <strong>foreign funds by candidates for elections, journalists or newspaper and media broadcast companies, judges and government servants, members of the legislature and political parties or their office-bearers, and organizations of a political nature.</strong></p>
<p><strong>How is FCRA registration granted?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>FCRA registrations are granted to individuals or <strong>associations that have definite cultural, economic, educational, religious, and social programmes.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For how long is the approval granted and when is it suspended?</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/10/24/fcra-and-ngo/"><strong>Click on this link</strong></a></p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-3"><strong>GS Paper 3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Conservation-related issues</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/india-forest-tree-cover-data-deforestation-explained-8474163/"><strong>IE</strong></a> </p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The article highlights how India mapped its forest cover over four decades and why making the data freely available will improve the quality of this vital policy input.</p>
<p><strong>Forest and tree cover in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While the <strong>Forest Survey of India</strong> (FSI) started publishing its <strong>biennial</strong> State of Forest reports in</li>
<li>Since 19.53% in the early 1980s, India’s <strong>forest cover has increased to 21.71% in 2021</strong>.</li>
<li>The country’s <strong>total green cover</strong> now stands at <strong>24.</strong><strong>62%</strong>, which was arrived after adding 2.91% tree cover estimated in 2021.</li>
<li>The forest maps are based on the images purchased from the <strong>National Remote Sensing Agency</strong> (NRSA), another arm of the government (Dept of Space).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How have these figures arrived?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>All plots of 1 hectare or more, with at least 10% tree canopy density</strong>, are counted within forest cover (irrespective of land use/ownership).</li>
<li>All land areas with tree <strong>canopy density of 70%</strong> or more are considered <strong>very dense forests,</strong> 40% and more – <strong>dense forests</strong> and those between 10-40% – <strong>open forests</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Isolated or small patches of trees</strong> (less than 1 hectare) and not counted as forest are assessed for determining <strong>tree cover</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Issues with green cover data in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Green cover data in India disregards the <strong>UN benchmark</strong> that does not include areas predominantly under agricultural and urban land use in forests.</li>
<li><strong>Recorded forest area vs green cover</strong><ul>
<li>In India, land recorded as forest in revenue records or proclaimed as forest under a forest law is described as a <strong>Recorded Forest Area</strong>.</li>
<li>Divided into Reserved, Protected and Unclassed forests, Recorded Forest Areas account for <strong>58%</strong> of India.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The inclusion of commercial plantations</strong>, orchards, village homesteads, urban housings, etc., as dense forests.</li>
<li><strong>The steady replacement of natural forests with plantations</strong> is worrisome, as natural forests support a lot more biodiversity and stock a lot more carbon.</li>
<li><strong>The outcome of the refinement of satellite images</strong> was that the forest cover fell within the forest area while it increased outside.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of manpower</strong> limits the FSI’s scope for verifying the quality of remotely sensed data in the field.</li>
<li><strong>The FSI never made its data freely available for public scrutiny</strong> and bars the media from accessing its geo-referenced maps.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best practice:</strong> Brazil maintains an open web platform, <strong>TerraBrasilis</strong>, for queries, analysis and dissemination of data on deforestation, forest cover change and forest fire.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>India is one of the few countries to have a scientific system of periodic forest cover assessment that provides <strong>valuable inputs</strong> for planning, policy formulation and evidence-based decision-making.</li>
<li><strong>Making the field data freely available</strong> to the public can enable them to volunteer to verify the country’s forest data on the ground.</li>

<h4 id="gs-paper-3_1"><strong>GS Paper 3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Infrastructure (Energy)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/india-clean-energy-transition-phasing-out-coal-grants-fetp/article66549079.ece#:~:text=Similar%20pacts%20have%20been%20signed,as%20they%20want%20coal%20out."><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> India is unlikely to reach an agreement – <strong>‘just energy transition partnership’ (JETP)</strong> – with richer nations this year.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>According to the IEA, <strong>India is the world’s third-largest power consumer</strong>.</li>
<li>Last year, the country faced <strong>one of its worst power crises</strong> as a heatwave swept across the nation.</li>
<li>C<strong>oal use will peak in India between 2030 and 2035,</strong> meanwhile, the country needs funding to strengthen its renewable grid and infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About JETP with India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Ministry of External Affairs</strong> is considering JETP proposals as India helms the G20 presidency.</li>
<li>The <strong>G7</strong> industrialised nations, together with Norway, Denmark and the EU, believe a JETP with India <strong>will financially empower it to reduce emissions from power production</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Similar pacts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>JETPs with <strong>South Africa and Indonesia</strong> are all about coal phase-out.</li>
<li>$15.5 billion for <strong>Vietnam</strong> to help it transition away from coal, with most of the money as loans.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How does a JETP with India seem unlikely?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>International funding rests on India committing to a <strong>timeline to phase out coal</strong>, which is not viable for the country as it will see an <strong>increase in energy demand and the possible increase in coal capacity.</strong></li>
<li>Hence, India wants a JETP on its own terms – <strong>no phase-out of coal</strong> and funds for clean energy expansion in the form of <strong>grants</strong>, not loans.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Coal vs renewable energy debate in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>India has recently <strong>relaxed environmental consultations</strong> on coal mine expansions, <strong>boosted its coal production</strong> and cited <strong>coal as critical for energy security</strong> in global climate dialogues.</li>
<li>But the country still aims to reduce coal from the current 50% of its energy mix to about 30% by 2030, while <strong>building 500 GW of new renewable capacity by 2030.</strong></li>
<li>With renewable energy storage capacity currently weak and expensive, India will <strong>phase out coal only when it is sure the transition won’t cause power disruptions.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges for India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>At least five Indian states depend heavily on the <strong>country’s coal economy.</strong></li>
<li>To ensure <strong>clean and affordable energy</strong> for all while moving away from fossil fuel.</li>
<li>To meet its renewable energy targets, India will have to invest an average of <strong>$27.9 billion annually up to 2029</strong>, but its budget allocations aren’t sufficient.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>India’s transition efforts need to be <strong>mindful of people’s energy aspirations</strong> and alternate livelihood for workers.</li>
<li>Even if we cannot cut down on coal, we have to prepare for a <strong>phase-down.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>India may be able to use its position as G20 leader this year to steer discussions on a deal toward <strong>just transition</strong> while scaling renewable capacity and investments in new technologies.</p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-3_2"><strong>GS Paper 3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Disaster Management and Preparedness</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/lessons-from-turkey-how-to-make-india-earthquake-prepared-8474242/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Delhi HC asked the state government to file a status report and action plan on the structural safety of buildings in Delhi.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Nearly <strong>59%</strong> of the Indian landmass is vulnerable to earthquakes and the concerns that have been raised by the court need a policy response.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/seismic_zone.jpg"><img alt="seismic_zone" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/seismic_zone.jpg?is-pending-load=1" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>India’s current policy on earthquake preparedness:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Operates primarily at the <strong>scale of structural details</strong></li>
<li><strong>National Building Codes</strong>: Includes specifying dimensions of the structural members – columns, beams, etc.</li>
<li><strong>National Retrofitting Programme</strong> <strong>2014</strong>: Under the programme, <strong>the RBI directed banks to deny loans</strong> for buildings that do not meet the earthquake-resistant design.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Issues with the policy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It ignores the buildings that were <strong>constructed before such codes were published in 1962</strong></li>
<li>It assumes infallibility in the processes of enforcement – <strong>relying only on penalisation and illegalities</strong></li>
<li>It treats earthquakes as a <strong>problem of individual buildings</strong> – in complete isolation from their urban context.</li>
<li><strong>None of the urban renewal programmes</strong> – including the Smart Cities Mission – have devised an urban policy for earthquake preparedness</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Earthquake preparedness</strong> needs to act –<ul>
<li>In the realm of policy and not just legal enforcement.</li>
<li>At the scale of building details as well as that of cities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>A comprehensive policy</strong> to create a system of <strong>retrofitting</strong> existing structures and <strong>enforcing seismic codes</strong> with more efficiency. Such a policy should include measures –<ul>
<li>To create a system of tax-based or development rights-based incentives for retrofitting one’s building up to seismic codes.</li>
<li>To ensure better enforcement of seismic codes through a similar model.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Generate earthquake vulnerability maps</strong> with the percentage of vulnerable structures in the area, the availability of evacuation routes, the location of nearest relief services, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best practices (Japan and San Francisco):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Japan</strong> has invested heavily in technological measures (skyscrapers with counterweights, small houses on flexible foundations, public infrastructure with automated triggers) by cultivating an industry around earthquake mitigation and fostering expertise.</li>
<li><strong>San Francisco</strong> is the world’s most famous earthquake-prone city which implemented policy changes similar to Japan.</li>
<li><strong>The Gujarat government:</strong> Immediately adopted (after the 2001 Bhuj earthquake) new <strong>town planning schemes that widened roads</strong> and created routes for evacuation and relief work.</li>
<li><strong>Programmes like the ongoing Urban 20 meetings</strong>: An excellent opportunity for international knowledge exchange on earthquake preparedness.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> A policy on earthquake preparedness will require a <strong>visionary, radical and transformative approach.</strong> It would be unwise to wait for another earthquake to learn how to be better prepared for one.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Images of traumatic events online, insensitive news, pandemics, etc. have attributed to the rising <strong>instances of compassion fatigue in recent years.</strong></p>
<p><strong>About Compassion Fatigue:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Compassion fatigue is a state of <strong>emotional exhaustion and burnout that can result from continuously</strong> caring for and empathizing with others who are <strong>experiencing pain or suffering</strong>.</li>
<li>It <strong>causes us to lose our capacity to react and help those in need.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Instances of how compassion fatigue develops:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Violence in digital media formats like video games and films can desensitize people’s responses to suffering or violence in real life.</strong></li>
<li>The consequence of <strong>seeing violent images is that you become numb to them and you think violence is no big deal.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Soldiers:</strong> Being in war – develops compassion fatigue.</li>
<li><strong>Doctors and Nurses</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why Compassion fatigue occurs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Compassion fatigue is a form of emotional protection</strong></li>
<li>The psychological mechanism <strong>behind compassion fatigue is desensitization</strong>.</li>
<li>Desensitization to violence and trauma can be an important <strong>adaptive strategy for people whose work involves frequent exposure to traumatic events, like soldiers, aid workers, and doctors.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Research shows how the conflict in Israel and Palestine <strong>escalates violence in children.</strong></p>

<p><strong>How to reverse compassion fatigue:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use social media to create <strong>empathy and compassion among people</strong></li>
<li>Take care of yourself: Self-care is essential to avoid burnout.</li>
<li>Practice mindfulness: Mindfulness meditation</li>
<li>Seek support</li>
<li>Take time off</li>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/phasing-out-the-line-math-is-not-for-a-girl/article66568747.ece"><strong>The Hindu</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Direction: This example can be used in the essay/GS2 Social Justice/ Ethics – how to remove biases from society.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Various research has shown that the representation of females in <strong>Science, Technology, Engineering, and</strong> <strong>Mathematics (STEM) or other math-intensive fields and careers remains far from ‘fair’ or desirable.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In recent research, a paper from the Annual Survey of Education Report (ASER) conducted across rural India findings shows that <strong>boys outperform girls in mathematics significantly, which has been persistent over time. The difference in reading scores, on the other hand, is negligible.</strong></li>
<li>There is a considerable variation though; <strong>while in the north Indian States of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Madhya Pradesh, boys outperform girls substantially, in south India, girls outperform boys in mathematics.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>More social norms than ‘ability’</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>“science and maths are meant for boys and arts and humanities for girls”</strong> is reflective of the kind of stereotyping that parents, relatives/neighbours, and even schoolteachers push.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The National Education Policy 2020 (NEP</strong>), recognizes the existence of <strong>continued disparities across all social groups and the need for developing interventions</strong> that enhance attendance and academic performance for girls.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Targeted behavioural interventions</strong> can curb the gender stereotyping of “math is not for a girl” at the household, societal, and school levels.</li>
<li><strong>References to female mathematicians in textbooks, female names, and characters</strong> in word problems, and <strong>providing exposure to female role models in STEM fields</strong> in the course curriculum are among other <strong>simple tweaks that are worth trying and likely to be beneficial.</strong></li>

<p>As per the new research, <strong>traditional fire burning practices or ‘cultural burns’ by indigenous Australians</strong> can help protect the iconic koala.</p>
<p>The cultural burns were <strong>cooler, lower, and slower than hot fires</strong>, encouraging the regeneration of suitable native plants while <strong>controlling other species (like banksias and wattle)</strong> to reduce the risk of fire reaching the canopy where <strong>koalas</strong> lived.</p>
<p><strong>The United Nations</strong> has noted that <strong>traditional knowledge of land management</strong>, including the use of fire to manage fuel, can be an <strong>effective way of reducing wildfire hazards</strong> and ensuring that biodiversity and cultural and ecological values are respected.</p>
<p><strong>About Koala:</strong></p>
<p><strong>They are</strong> <strong>arboreal</strong> <strong>herbivorous</strong> <strong>marsupial</strong> <strong>native</strong> to Australia. The koala is one of 110 priority species that the Australian government aims to save from extinction over the next 10 years.</p>
<p><strong>Usage:</strong> It can be used to show the importance of traditional knowledge in environmental conservation as well as the way to mitigate the risk of forest fires.</p>

<p>OECMs are <strong>areas outside of protected areas</strong> that are governed and managed to achieve effective conservation of biodiversity.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples of OECMs:</strong> agricultural systems, conserved water catchments, locally managed marine areas, and other high conservation value areas.</li>
<li>It was recognized by <strong>Convention on Biological diversity guidelines</strong> in 2018.</li>
<li><strong>World Database on OECMs:</strong> Contains data on OECMs identified by Governments, organizations, Indigenous peoples, and local communities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>They provide <strong>support for effective long-term conservation efforts</strong> outside of designated protected areas.</li>
<li>OECMs promote <strong>equitable governance, and positive conservation outcomes</strong>, supporting threatened species recovery, supporting sustainable livelihoods, and addressing climate change.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Usage:</strong> The example can be used for environment questions as another dimension in conservation</p>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/what-whip-state-assembly-parliament-8473933/"><strong>Indian Express</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> A five-judge Bench led by the Chief Justice of India is hearing petitions filed in the wake of last year’s political crisis in Maharashtra – raising the importance of whip.</p>
<p><strong>What is a ‘whip’ in the House?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In parliamentary parlance, a whip may refer to <strong>both a written order to members of a party in the House</strong> <strong>to abide by a certain direction and to a designated official of the party who is authorized to issue such a direction</strong>.</li>
<li>The term is derived from the <strong>old British practice of “whipping in” lawmakers to follow the party line.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How serious are whips issued by parties?</strong></p>
<p>The importance of a whip can be inferred from the <strong>number of times an order is underlined.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>one-line whip</strong> underlined once, is usually issued to <strong>inform party members of a vote, and allows them to abstain in case they decide not to follow the party line.</strong></li>
<li>A two-<strong>line whip directs them to be present during the vote.</strong></li>
<li>A <strong>three-line whip is the strongest</strong>, employed on important <strong>occasions such as the second reading of a Bill or a no-confidence motion, and places an obligation on members to toe the party line.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What can happen if a whip is defied?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>United Kingdom</strong> – an MP can <strong>lose membership of the party for defying the whip</strong>, but can keep her/ his House seat as an Independent.</li>
<li><strong>US</strong> – the party whip’s role is to gauge how <strong>many legislators are in support of a Bill and how many</strong> are opposed to it — and the extent possible, persuade them to vote according to the party line on the issue.</li>
<li><strong>India</strong> – rebelling against a <strong>three-line whip can put a lawmaker’s membership in the House at risk</strong>. The <strong>anti-defection law allows the Speaker/ Chairperson to disqualify such a member</strong>; the only exception is when there is merger of the party.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Supreme Court refused to hear a plea by Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reason</strong>: SC disapproved of Sisodia approaching it directly under <strong>Article 32 of the Constitution</strong> when the remedy of moving the <strong>High Court under Section 482 of the CrPC</strong> was available to him.</li>
<li>The court had <strong>rejected</strong> Sisodia’s arguments that <strong>he had a right against self-incrimination</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is right against self-incrimination?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Article 20(3):</strong> “No person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Since the onus of <strong>proving the case against the accused (in criminal cases) beyond a reasonable doubt</strong> is on the <strong>state</strong>, a person cannot be compelled to testify against himself or share information that <strong>might go against him in a trial</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Delhi excise policy case:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Now-scrapped liquor sales policy</strong> (2021) allowed <strong>only private shops to sell liquor</strong> and permitted home delivery and unlimited discounts. It relieved the state from the sale of liquor. The policy resulted in a <strong>27% increase in revenue</strong> for the government. However, there were allegations of bending rules and providing undue benefits to liquor vend licensees.</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: Ministry of Science and Technology <strong>unveiled a fellowship to bring Indian-origin researchers</strong> to higher educational institutions in India <strong>for a maximum period of two months per year</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aim of the fellowship:</strong> It aims to improve the <strong>research ecosystem of India’s higher</strong> educational institutions by facilitating academic and research collaborations with the best institutions in the world through the <strong>mobility of researchers from overseas institutions</strong> to India.</p>
<p><strong>Criteria</strong>: Applicant should be NRI or PIO or OCI and must have obtained a Ph.D./M. D/M. S degree from a recognized University.</p>
<p><strong>Other schemes for improving the research ecosystem in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A 3-tiered graded autonomy regulatory system</strong> has been initiated</li>
<li><strong>Global Initiative for Academics Network (GIAN) (to</strong> invite distinguished academicians, and experts from across the world to teach in India)</li>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: In a significant development in <strong>DNA vaccination research, India’s first and only DNA vaccine candidate for dengue has shown promising results.</strong></p>
<p><strong>About DNA Vaccines:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A DNA vaccine is a vaccine that <strong>puts a specific DNA sequence that codes for an antigen</strong> into an organism’s cells to trigger an immune response.</li>
<li>The world’s first DNA vaccine—<strong>ZyCoV-D,</strong> developed by <strong>Zydus Cadila</strong>—was approved in 2021 for emergency <strong>use against COVID-19.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why developing an effective DNA vaccine for dengue is tough?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Because it is caused by <strong>four closely related viruses—DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3 and DEN-4</strong>—called serotypes.</li>
<li>Each one <strong>interacts differently with antibodies in human blood</strong>. A person infected with DEN-1 is then protected against it for life, but not against the other three serotypes. An ideal vaccine must target all serotypes.</li>
