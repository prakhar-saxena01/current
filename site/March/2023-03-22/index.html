<h4 id="gs-paper-3_1"><strong>GS Paper 3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Infrastructure/Environment/Conservation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/india-misses-re-capacity-target-due-to-low-solar-rooftop-wind-energy-project-installations-parliamentary-panel/article66646350.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> A parliamentary panel has attributed the low installation of solar roof-top and wind energy projects as key reasons for the shortfall in achieving India’s <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/10/sansad-tv-future-of-green-energy-in-india/"><strong>renewable energy</strong> (RE)</a> <strong>capacity target of 175 GW by 2022.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>India set an ambitious target (in 2014) of installing 175 GW of RE capacity by the year 2022, which included <strong>100 GW (solar), 60 GW (wind), 10 GW (bio-power), and 5 GW (small hydropower).</strong></li>
<li>While India has enhanced its promises to RE in the “<strong>Long-Term Low-Carbon Development Plan</strong>” presented at the <strong>UNFCCC COP27</strong>, it appears that the nation will fall short of one of its initial pledges in the RE sector.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/175-GW.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/175-GW.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Findings of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Energy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A RE capacity of<strong>90 GW</strong> (69% of the overall target) <strong>has been installed</strong> in the country as of December 31, 2022.</li>
<li>This is a commendable achievement, as the RE installed capacity has <strong>increased by more than 236% since 2014</strong>.</li>
<li>Whatever shortfall has occurred in achieving the target is because of <strong>the low installation of solar roof-tops and wind energy projects.</strong><ul>
<li>Against 40 GW, <strong>only 7.40 GW</strong> of rooftop solar projects could be installed in the country.</li>
<li>Against 60 GW, the cumulative installed capacity of wind power is 41.93 GW.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Issues responsible for deficient performance under the solar rooftop programme:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Non-availability of information at the grass root level,</li>
<li>Lack of awareness about this scheme amongst the masses,</li>
<li>The apathy of discoms, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Keeping in view India’s commitment to increase its <strong>non-fossil fuel-based energy capacity to 500 GW by 2030</strong>, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) must ramp up its pace for the timely achievement of targets.</li>
<li><strong>A strict timeline</strong> should be imposed for approvals/rejection of applications, installation of net-metre, an inspection of the system, etc., by the discoms.<ul>
<li>As of Feb 2023, out of 43,171 applications received on the National Portal, 18437 – were approved by DISCOMs, 3031 – were rejected on technical grounds and the rest are pending.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Discoms may be incentivised</strong> to allay their concerns about losing their high-paying customers as a result of the installation of solar rooftops.</li>
<li>The MNRE should <strong>increase its fund absorption capacity</strong> and focus on exhaustive utilization of the budgetary allocation.<ul>
<li>In the Union Budget 2023-24, Rs 10,222 crore has been allocated to MNRE with <strong>an increase of 45%</strong> against the Revised Estimates of 2022.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> With an aim to improve medical tourism in the country, the Ministry of Tourism has formulated a <strong>National Strategy and Roadmap for Medical and Wellness Tourism (2022).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> India has been ranked <strong>10th</strong> in the <strong>Medical Tourism Index (MTI) for 2020-2021 out of 46</strong> destinations in the world by the Medical Tourism Association.</p>
<p><strong>Medical vs wellness tourism:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Medical tourism</strong> (valued at $60-80 billion globally) primarily addresses the “<strong>poor health</strong>” end of the market, with patients travelling to another place for specific medical treatments.</li>
<li><strong>Wellness tourism</strong> (~$639 billion), on the other hand, attracts those seeking destinations that extend their <strong>wellness lifestyle</strong> and help them proactively maintain and improve their health and well-being.</li>
<li>As far as medical tourism is concerned, India currently has a <strong>$5-6 billion market</strong> (2019 figure) that may rise to <strong>$13 billion by 2026.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/foregine.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/foregine.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Govt. efforts to boost the medical tourism sector in India:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Streamlining</strong> <strong>Medical Value Travel (MVT)</strong>: A segment that attracted 0.7 million foreign tourists in pre-pandemic 2019.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MVT is a specialised service</strong> by Hospitals and Wellness centres including both modern as well as traditional systems of medicine.</li>
<li>It involves healthcare service providers, VISA requirements, insurance, MVT facilitators, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>National Strategy and Roadmap for Medical and Wellness Tourism (2022):</strong> Key pillars for the development of MVT in the country:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Develop a brand</strong> for India as a wellness destination</li>
<li><strong>Strengthen the ecosystem</strong> for medical and wellness tourism</li>
<li><strong>Enable digitalization</strong> by setting up an <strong>Online Medical Value Travel (MVT) Portal</strong></li>
<li>Enhancement of <strong>accessibility</strong> for Medical Value Travel</li>
<li><strong>Promoting</strong> Wellness Tourism</li>
<li><strong>Governance and Institutional Framework</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Heal in India Initiative:</strong> The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the Ministry of Ayush have been working with C-DAC and the Services Export Promotion Council for developing a One Step Heal in India portal for the Promotion of MVT.</p>
<p><strong>Champion Service Sector Scheme:</strong> The Ministry of Ayush developed a Central Sector Scheme for MVT to incentivise private investors for the establishment of Super Specialty Hospitals, etc.</p>
<p><strong>e-Tourist Visa scheme:</strong> It was liberalised and renamed as an e-Visa scheme and at present, it has <strong>e-Medical Visa and e-Medical Attendant Visa</strong> as sub-categories of e-visa.</p>
<p><strong>National Medical &amp; Wellness Tourism Board (NMWTB):</strong> The Ministry of Tourism constituted the Board in 2015 to provide a dedicated institutional framework to take forward the cause of promotion of Medical and Wellness Tourism.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> In order to prevent excessive exploitation of <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/07/un-groundwater-summit-2022/">groundwater (GW</a>), a Parliamentary Standing Committee report recommends <strong>discouraging the use of electric pumps</strong> by introducing measures such as pre-paid cards, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights of the report – “Groundwater: A Valuable but Diminishing Resource”:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Over-extraction of GW</strong> for meeting irrigation needs is prevalent in Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan, meeting 97%, 90%, and 86% of their irrigation needs from GW extraction.</li>
<li>Others such as Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and UP are also significant users of GW for irrigation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The main reason for such overexploitation of GW:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wide cultivation of water guzzler</strong> paddy and sugarcane crops which are heavily incentivised by way of highly subsidised pricing of water, etc.</li>
<li><strong>For example</strong>, states like Punjab, Haryana, Telangana and Tamil Nadu <strong>offer completely free power</strong>, while others collect token charges.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong> The central government’s <strong>inability to persuade</strong> states to reduce/stop subsidies for the power given in agriculture as –</p>
<ul>
<li>Water being a <strong>State subject</strong></li>
<li>Electricity is a <strong>concurrent subject</strong>, and</li>
<li>State Electricity Regulatory Commissions determine the electricity tariff for retail supply to end consumers under the extant provisions of the <strong>Electricity Act, 2003</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Devising <strong>integrated measures</strong> for adoption in agriculture.</li>
<li>Introduction of <strong>pre-paid cards for power supply, restricting it for a few hours in the day</strong>, etc.</li>
<li>A need for a shift in <strong>focus from ‘land productivity’ to ‘water productivity’</strong> (production per cubic meter of water).</li>
<li>The Ministry of Jal Shakti <strong>to work out a policy to ensure judicious water use</strong> not only to reduce dependence on GW but to reduce its footprint in agriculture by engaging the Agriculture Ministry.</li>
<li>The Jal Shakti Ministry should urge both the Power Ministry and the Agriculture Ministry along with state governments <strong>to take measures on the suggested lines.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steps taken by the Indian government:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Atal Bhujal Yojana</strong> is a groundwater management scheme launched in 2019.</li>
<li><strong>Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA) (2019):</strong> It was launched in 256 water-stressed districts in the country to improve water availability including groundwater conditions in these areas.</li>
<li><strong>Aquifer Mapping and Management Programme, etc.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best practice:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Punjab govt. <strong>introduced a scheme to refund money to the farmers</strong> if they consume less electricity.</li>
<li><strong>Deendayal Upadhyay Gram Jyoti Yojana</strong> of the Ministry of Power has a <strong>separate component of agriculture and non-agriculture feeders</strong>, facilitating judicious rostering of supply to agriculture &amp; non-agriculture consumers in rural areas.</li>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: <strong>National Security Act</strong> has been invoked in the <strong>case of self-styled Sikh preacher and on-the-run Waris Punjab De chief Amritpal Singh.</strong></p>
<p><strong>About</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/security-issues/national-security/national-security-act-nsa-1980/"><strong>National Security Act, 1980</strong></a><strong>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>NSA <strong>“empowers the state to detain a person without a formal charge and without trial”.</strong></li>
<li>Under the Act, a person is taken into custody to <strong>prevent them</strong> from acting in any manner prejudicial to “<strong>the security of the state” or for “maintenance of the public order”.</strong></li>
<li>It is an a<strong>dministrative order passed either by the Divisional Commissioner or the District Magistrate (DM).</strong></li>
<li>Even if a person is in <strong>police custody, the District Magistrate can slap NSA against them</strong>. Or, if a person has been <strong>granted bail by a trial court, they can be immediately detained under the NS</strong> If the person has been <strong>acquitted by the court, the same person can be detained under the NSA.</strong></li>
<li>The law t<strong>akes away an individual’s constitutional right to be produced before the magistrate within 24 hour</strong>s, as is the case when the accused is in police custody. <strong>The detained person also does not have the right to move a bail application before a criminal court.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are the grounds for detention?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>NSA can be invoked to <strong>prevent a person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the defence of India,</strong> relations of India with foreign powers or the security of India. Among others, it can also be applied to <strong>prevent a person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community.</strong></li>
<li>An individual can be detained <strong>without a charge for a maximum period of 12 months</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the protection available under the Act?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Indian Constitution <strong>allows both</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/08/03/preventive-detention-only-to-forestall-public-disorder-sc/"><strong>preventive detention</strong></a> <strong>and the right of protection against arrest and detention in certain cases,</strong> enshrined under Article 22 of the Constitution.</li>
<li>However, <strong>Article 22(3) provides that the rights available to an arrested person will not be applicable in case of preventive detention, thus an exception is carved out.</strong></li>
<li>One crucial procedural safeguard under the <strong>NSA is granted under Article 22(5),</strong> where all the <strong>detained persons have the right to make an effective representation before an independent advisory board,</strong> which consists of three members; and the board is chaired by a member who is, or has been, a judge of a high court.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> SC has suggested a <strong>State-specific approach (and not a “one-size-fits-all” approach)</strong>  to setting up special courts for the speedy trial of legislators.</p>
<p><strong>Data:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Criminal cases against legislators are <strong>5097, with 400</strong> of them concerning heinous offences.</li>
<li><strong>Around a third of the criminal cases</strong> against elected representatives in the Lok Sabha and state assemblies have been <strong>pending for at least five years</strong></li>
<li><strong>30% of criminal cases</strong> against MPs, and MLAs pending trial</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p><strong>In 2017, the Supreme Court ordered</strong> that special courts be set up across the country <strong>to fast-track the long-pending</strong> trials of lawmakers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Following this, 12 special courts were set up across 11 States exclusively to try sitting MPs and MLAs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other observations by SC:</strong></p>
<p>The court is also considering a <strong>plea for a lifetime ban on people convicted of offences</strong> from contesting elections and becoming Members of Parliament and State Legislative Assemblies. However, the government had opposed it in 2020.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Currently, legislators face disqualification under the Representation of the People Act of 1951</strong> for the period of the prison sentence and six years thereafter</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Kerala HC declared the election of a legislator (A Raja) as null and void, holding that as a baptised Christian, he is ineligible to contest from a seat reserved for members of the SC.</p>
<p><strong>Issue of the reservation to Christians/Muslims converted to SC:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Constitution (Scheduled Caste) Order, 1950</strong> challenged in the present case was based on historical data which established that “<strong>no backwardness or oppression was ever faced by members of Christian or Islamic Society</strong>.”<ul>
<li>It allowed <strong>only Hindus to be classified as SCs</strong> and was later amended to include <strong>Sikhs</strong> in 1956, and <strong>Buddhists</strong> in 1990.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Centre had established a commission, under former <strong>CJI KG Balakrishnan,</strong> to examine the grant of SC status to persons converted to religions other than in the Presidential Orders issued under <strong>Article 341 of the Constitution</strong>.</li>
<li>Under Article 341 –<ul>
<li><strong>The President</strong> may with respect to any State (after consultation with the Governor) or UT, may notify the SCs in relation to that State/UT.</li>
<li><strong>The Parliament</strong> may by law include or exclude from the list of SCs specified in a notification issued.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The National Commission for Religious and Linguistic Minorities, headed by erstwhile <strong>CJI Ranganath Misra</strong>, recommended a complete delinking of religion from the classification of SCs in 2007.<ul>
<li>However, Parliament rejected these recommendations on account of inadequate field data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Sachar Committee</strong>, to examine the socio-economic conditions of Indian Muslims, 2006 observed that the situation of Dalit Muslims did not improve even after conversion.<ul>
<li>The report placed Muslims below SCs and STs in backwardness.</li>

<ul>
<li>The World Happiness Report, first published in 2012, is based on people’s own assessment of their happiness, as well as economic and social data.</li>
<li>The report considers six key factors: <strong>social support, income, health, freedom, generosity, and absence of corruption.</strong></li>
<li>It assigns a happiness score based on an <strong>average of data over a three-year period</strong>.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Recently, the Swiss government-brokered takeover of Credit Suisse by its larger rival UBS has wiped out the investment of bondholders and created fear for AT1 bondholders</p>
<p><strong>What is a Bond?</strong></p>
<p>Bonds are a type of security instrument, issued by governments and corporations when they want to raise money.</p>
<p><strong>What is an AT1 bond?</strong></p>
<p>AT1 bonds – sometimes known as contingent convertible bonds, or <strong>CoCos</strong> – are a type of debt issued by a bank that can be converted into equity if its capital levels fall below requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Why AT1 Bond?</strong></p>
<p>It was introduced after the global financial crisis of 2007-08, banks were asked to operate using their own permanent capital as opposed to borrowed capital. This permanent capital is termed Tier 1 capital</p>
<p>Now, to shore up their Tier 1 capital, <strong>banks were allowed to raise a special class of bonds known as AT1 bonds from investors</strong>. AT1 bonds, like other bonds, <strong>pay regular interest</strong>. But they <strong>do not have a maturity date</strong>, as they are a permanent part of the bank’s capital, akin to equity.</p>
<p><strong>AT1 bonds are the riskiest bond as the issuing</strong> bank can skip premium and interest payout if it is falling short of capital</p>
