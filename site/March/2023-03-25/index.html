<h4 id="gs-paper-1"><strong>GS Paper 1</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus</strong><strong>: Geography –</strong> Important Geophysical phenomena such as earthquakes, Tsunami, Volcanic activity, cyclones etc</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/climate-change/here-is-the-science-behind-unseasonal-rains-and-hailstorms-that-flattened-crops-in-india-88446">DTE</a></p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: Recently <strong>large parts of the country experienced hailstorms</strong> which <strong>were also accompanied by torrents of rain</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The hail and rains have led to <strong>extensive damage to standing crops in many states, such as Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Punjab.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Causes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The rainfall and the storms <strong>were caused by multiple</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/04/18/western-disturbance/">western disturbances (WD),</a> other WD-<strong>associated weather systems and many troughs, which are extended low-pressure areas, formed due to the interaction of the WDs</strong> and associated systems with winds blowing in from the east, mainly the Bay of Bengal.</li>
<li>A <strong>warming Arabian Sea could also be responsible for the intense storm activity</strong> and rain.</li>
<li>The IMD also cited a <strong>strong subtropical</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-geography-2/indian-climate/indian-monsoon/mechanism-of-formation-of-indian-monsoon/recent-concepts/role-of-jet-streams/#:~:text=Sub%2Dtropical%20westerly%20jet%20stream%3A%20It%20dominates%20in%20winter%20time,height%20of%20about%2012%20km.">westerly jet stream</a>, a band of winds that circles the <strong>subtropical regions of the planet in the upper layers of the</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/world-geography/physical-geography-of-the-world/climatology/structure-composition-of-atmosphere/#:~:text=Troposphere%20means%20%E2%80%9Cregion%20of%20mixing,18%20km">troposphere</a>%20above%20the%20equator.)<strong>, as a reason for the storm activity.</strong></li>
<li>This was aided by the <strong>incursion of moisture-laden winds from the Bay of Bengal and</strong> the lowering of the freezing level in the atmosphere, which helped in the formation of hail.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Western Disturbances:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Western disturbances are <strong>extra-tropical</strong> <strong>storms that originate in the Caspian or Mediterranean Sea</strong>, <strong>which is an area of low pressure &amp; bring sudden showers(non-monsoonal), snow and fog to northwest India.</strong></li>
<li>These <strong>travel eastwards on high-altitude westerly jet streams</strong>– massive ribbons of fast winds traversing the earth from west to east.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Recent studies have shown that the w<strong>arming of the Arctic and the Mediterranean Sea</strong> means <strong>that Western Disturbances are striking India less in winter</strong> and more in summer; with <strong>catastrophic consequences.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reason for weakening Western Disturbances:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Climate Change</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>One of the reasons for the <strong>abnormally hot February was the formation of a high-pressure area near the land surface, which caused the air to descend, compress and heat up.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: The <strong>Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT)</strong> has amended a notification of 2018 – “to the <strong>extent that export of</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/science-technology/biotechnology/biofuels/">biofuel</a> <strong>from special economic zones/export-oriented units</strong> are allowed for <strong>fuel as well as non-fuel purpos</strong>e without any restriction <strong>when produced using only imported feedstock”.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A licence is <strong>required for both exports and imports of biofuels</strong>. Biofuels include <strong>ethyl alcohol, petroleum oil and oils obtained from bituminous minerals, bio-diesel and mixtures.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Biofuels:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Any hydrocarbon fuel that is <strong>produced from an organic matter (living or once living material) in a short period of time (days, weeks, or even months) is considered a biofuel.</strong></li>
<li>Biofuels may <strong>be solid, liquid or gaseous in nature.</strong></li>
<li>These can be <strong>used to replace or can be used in addition to diesel, petrol or other fossil fuels</strong> for transport, stationary, portable and other applications.</li>
<li>Some of the <strong>main reasons for shifting to biofuels are the rising prices of oil, the emission of greenhouse gases from fossil fuels</strong> and the interest in obtaining fuel from agricultural crops for the benefit of farmers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Classification of Biofuels:</strong></p>

<p>Luis Caffarelli, a 74-year-old mathematician from Argentina, has been awarded the <strong>2023 Abel Prize for his contributions to</strong> regularity theory for nonlinear partial differential equations, including free-boundary problems and the Monge-Ampère equation.</p>
<p><strong>Ethical lessons we can learn from Luis Caffarelli’s life:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Persistence and perseverance</strong>: Abel faced many challenges and obstacles throughout his life, including poverty, illness, and a lack of recognition for his work.</li>
<li><strong>Intellectual honesty</strong>: Abel was known for his honesty and integrity in his work. He never claimed credit for the work of others and always acknowledged the contributions of his colleagues and predecessors.</li>
<li><strong>Creativity and innovation</strong>: Abel was a pioneer in the field of mathematics, and his work laid the foundation for many future developments in the field.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About the Abel Prize</strong></p>
<p>It was first awarded in <strong>2003 and recognizes pioneering achievements</strong> in mathematics, named after Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel.</p>
<p>The prize includes a monetary award of roughly $720,000 and a glass plaque designed by <strong>Norwegian artist Henrik Haugan.</strong></p>

<p><strong>About Sharada Peeth:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sharada Peeth is a <strong>ruined Hindu temple and ancient centre of learning located in the Neelum Valley of Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir.</strong></li>
<li>It is situated in the valley of <strong>Mount Harmukh, believed by Kashmiri Pandits to be the abode of Shiva.</strong></li>
<li>It was probably commissioned by Lalitaditya Muktapida though no definitive evidence exists in favour.</li>
<li>Al-<strong>Biruni recorded the place for the first time, as a revered shrine housing a wooden image of Sharda</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Educational Centre:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Between the <strong>6th and 12th centuries CE</strong>, it was among the <strong>most prominent temple universities in the Indian subcontinent.</strong></li>
<li>It played a key role in the <strong>development and popularisation of the Sharada script in North India,</strong> causing the <strong>script to be named after it, and Kashmir to acquire the moniker “Sharada Desh”, meaning “country of Sharada”.</strong></li>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: The <strong>Odisha government has proposed to amend</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/09/29/right-to-fair-compensation-and-transparency-in-land-acquisition-rehabilitation-and-resettlement-act-2013/">the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013</a> to ease the land acquisition process for various industrial and infrastructure projects.</p>
<p><strong>More about the bill:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Odisha government <strong>aims to do away with the mandatory provision of social impact assessment (SIA) study before the land acquisition, which, it says, is a time-consuming process.</strong></li>
<li>The state government through the ‘<strong>Make in Odisha’ initiative intends to attract private investments in mega projects across sectors to fast-track the development process</strong>. Providing hassle-free land to the <strong>project proponents is one of the basic requirements for industrial and infrastructure development.</strong></li>
<li>Projects like <strong>affordable housing, industrial corridors set up by the state government, infrastructure projects, including highways and railways and industrial projects involving displacement of 100 families or less, or acquisition of private land of 500 acres or less will also be exempt from conducting mandatory SIA.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Odisha will be the <strong>fourth state to amend the legislation as Gujarat (2016), Maharashtra (2018) and Karnataka (2019) have already made the amendment and received the assent of the President of India.</strong></p>
