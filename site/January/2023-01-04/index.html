<h4 id="gs-paper-2"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Indian Constitution—Historical Underpinnings, Evolution, Features, Amendments, Significant Provisions and Basic Structure</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/supreme-court-rules-no-restrictions-free-speech-8357979/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Direction:</strong> The article highlights the recent SC judgement in the context of the scope of the right to free speech under the Constitution of India.</p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The SC held there is <strong>no reason to impose “additional restrictions”</strong> on the right to free speech {under Article 19(2) of the Indian Constitution} of ministers, including MLAs and MPs.</p>
<p>Article 19 (Protection of certain rights regarding freedom of speech, etc.):</p>
<p><strong>(1)</strong> All citizens shall have the right-</p>
<p><strong>(a) to freedom of speech and expression;</strong></p>
<p>(b) to assemble peaceably and without arms;</p>
<p>(c) to form associations or unions;</p>
<p>(d) to move freely throughout the territory of India;</p>
<p>(e) to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India;</p>
<p>(g) to practise any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business.</p>
<p><strong>(2)</strong> Nothing in 19 (1) (a) shall affect the operation of any existing law, or prevent the State from making any law, as far as such law imposes <strong>reasonable restrictions</strong> in the interests of the –</p>
<p>●        Sovereignty and integrity of India,</p>
<p>●        Security of the State,</p>
<p>●        Friendly relations with foreign States,</p>
<p>●        Public order,</p>
<p>●        Decency or morality, or</p>
<p>●        In relation to contempt of court, <strong>defamation or incitement to an offence</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The case (Kaushal Kishor v the State of UP), relates to the Bulandshahar rape incident of 2016, in which the then Minister of the State termed the incident a <strong>‘political conspiracy and nothing else’</strong>.</li>
<li>The survivors then filed a writ petition before the SC and the court raised an important question – <strong>“Whether restrictions can be imposed on a public functionary’s right to freedom of speech and expression</strong>?”.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The majority judgement:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Even if the remarks are related to state affairs or intended to protect the government, <strong>the government is not legally responsible for them.</strong></li>
<li>While citizens had the right to petition the Court for violations of Articles 19 and 21 (right to life), a statement made by the Minister that was inconsistent with citizens’ rights <strong>may not by itself be actionable.</strong></li>
<li>However, if it results in an omission (error) or commission (command) of an offence by a public official, remedies can be sought.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The dissenting opinion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Freedom of speech and expression is <strong>a much-needed right</strong> so that citizens are well-informed and educated on governance.</li>
<li>As a result, the dissenting judge agreed with the majority that <strong>further restrictions on speech were unnecessary.</strong></li>
<li>If the statements made by a Minister are <strong>derogatory</strong>, the government should be legally liable.</li>
<li>The word <strong>‘fraternity’</strong> in the Preamble of the Constitution, ensures that the dignity of individuals cannot be harmed by an unwarranted speech by fellow citizens, including public officials.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> <strong>Hate speech strikes at the foundational values</strong> of society. However, common law remedies are present to address those issues and creating another set of guidelines or laws is a matter for <strong>Parliament to deliberate</strong> (the dissenting opinion).</p>

<p><strong>Direction:</strong> The article discusses Israel’s occupation of Palestinian land over time and attempts to restore normalcy in the region.</p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The UNGA passed a resolution (India abstained from the vote) that asked the body’s highest court, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), to render its opinion on the legal consequences of Israel’s prolonged occupation of Palestinian land.</p>
<p><strong>Israel’s occupation of Palestinian land:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/israle_2.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/israle_2.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>A UNGA resolution had sought to partition the <strong>British mandate Palestine</strong>, which was rejected by the Arabs.</li>
<li>The state of Israel was declared in 1948 → first Arab-Israeli war (1948).</li>
<li><strong>Historically Palestine was divided</strong> into the –<ul>
<li>State of Israel (including West Jerusalem),</li>
<li>West Bank (including East Jerusalem) that was taken over by Jordan and</li>
<li>Gaza Strip (controlled by Egypt).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tensions kept rising between Israel and <strong>Egypt, Jordan, and Syria,</strong> which led to the six-day war of 1967.</li>
<li><strong>The war resulted in Israel capturing</strong> the –<ul>
<li>West Bank,</li>
<li>Gaza Strip (Israel withdrew in 2005, however, its external borders are still controlled by Israel and Egypt),</li>
<li>East Jerusalem,</li>
<li>Syria’s Golan Heights and</li>
<li>Sinai Peninsula of Egypt (later returned to Egypt).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Israel also declared the whole of <strong>Jerusalem</strong> as its “eternal, undivided capital”.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Attempts to restore normalcy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The UNSC passed a resolution in late 1967</strong> stating that Israel must withdraw from the territories it seized in the war.</li>
<li>However, it is yet to happen and the fate of Palestinian self-determination remains uncertain.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What does the recent resolution seek to do?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It asked the ICJ to advise on the legal consequences of –<ul>
<li>Israel’s occupation, settlement and annexation.</li>
<li>Israel’s measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>There are two possibilities</strong> – the ICJ can either lead to a settlement between parties or it can lead to a trial followed by a verdict. While its rulings are <strong>binding</strong>, the ICJ has no power to enforce them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The UN resolution coincides with the return of Benjamin Netanyahu as Israel’s Prime Minister for a sixth time. In his words, “Jewish people have an exclusive and unquestionable right to all areas of the Land of Israel.”</li>
<li>There are fears that the <strong>new hard-line regime will bring damaging impacts for Palestinians.</strong></li>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: “<strong>Stockholm+50: A healthy planet for the prosperity of all — our responsibility, our opportunity”</strong> was held in the year 2022 to mark the <strong>50 years of the Stockholm Conference</strong> ( Report of United Nations Conference on the Human Environment).</p>
<p><strong>About Stockholm Conference, 1972</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This was the <strong>first global convergence on the planetary environment and natural resources.</strong></li>
<li>Also termed the “<strong>Swedish Initiative</strong>”, the idea of the Stockholm Conference was first proposed by Sweden.</li>
<li>The theme was <strong>‘Only One Earth’.</strong></li>
<li>Stockholm Declaration: To build the <strong>“interconnections between development, poverty and the environment”.</strong></li>
<li>Action Plan for the Human Environment<ul>
<li>Global Environmental Assessment Programme (watch plan)</li>
<li>Environmental management activities</li>
<li>International measures to support assessment and management activities carried out at the national and international levels.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Three Dimensions of the Conference:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Countries agreed to not <strong>“harm each other’s environment or the areas beyond national jurisdiction</strong>”.</li>
<li>An action plan to <strong>study the threat to Earth’s environment.</strong></li>
<li>Establishment of an international body called the <strong>UN Environment Programme (UNEP) to bring cooperation among countries.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Significance:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Stockholm Conference of 1972 put <strong>environmental issues on the global agenda for the first time.</strong></li>
<li>No country had an environment ministry until 1972.<ul>
<li>Today, over <strong>176 countries have environmental framework laws;</strong> 150 countries have enshrined <strong>environmental protection or the right to a healthy environment</strong> in their <strong>constitutions</strong>; and 164 countries have created <strong>cabinet-level bodies responsible for environmental protectio</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After 1972, the environment <strong>started making headlines and public consciousness increased.</strong></li>
<li>Many of today’s conventions on environmental crises <strong>trace their origin to the Stockholm Declaration.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>An <strong>uncoordinated response</strong> from the nations: The world is on track to warm at least 3˚C above pre-industrial levels by 2100.</li>
<li><strong>Poverty</strong> is the biggest hurdle in the way of adopting sustainable measures for a healthy environment, as <strong>poverty can’t be eradicated without the use of science and technology.</strong></li>
</ul>

Stockholm Conference is different from Stockholm Convention<br />

<p><strong>Direction</strong>: This could be used as an example to show that ‘<strong>disability is not a limitation’</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>European Space Agency</strong> (ESA) will announce the 1st astronaut — or astronauts — with a physical disability soon, under ESA’s “<strong>parastronaut project</strong>”.</p>
<p>People with <strong>physical disabilities</strong> have previously been excluded from being an astronaut — due to strict selection requirements.</p>
<p>After carrying out a feasibility study, the ESA said potential candidates could include people who have <strong>deficiencies in their lower limbs, whether from amputation or congenital defects.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: Members of the Jain community have been staging protests across the country for the past two weeks over demands related to two holy sites — <strong>Sammed Shikhar on Parasnath hill in Jharkhand and Shetrunjay hill in Palitana of Gujarat.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sammed Shikharji Temple:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is believed that <strong>20 out of 24 Tirthankars (Jain spiritual leaders</strong>) attained salvation at Sammed Shikharji.</li>
<li>Sammed Shikharji, located on the <strong>Parasnath Hills in the Giridih district of Jharkhand</strong>, is the biggest pilgrimage of the Jain community.</li>
<li>It is important for both the <strong>Digambara and Swethambara</strong> sects of Jainism. The hill is known to be the <strong>highest mountain</strong> in Jharkhand.</li>
<li>The Hill is named after <strong>Parasnath</strong> (the 23rd Tirthankar)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/hill.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/hill.jpg?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Shetrunjay hill:</strong></p>
<p>Situated on the banks of the <strong>Shetrunji river</strong> around 164 feet above sea level, Shetrunjaya Hills near Palitana city are home to <strong>865 Jain temples and are a holy place for Shwetambara Jains.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>About the issue:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In Jharkhand, the issue is about <strong>Parasnath hill being declared a tourist spot and an eco-sensitive zone</strong>, neither the Centre nor the state <strong>consulted the main stakeholder</strong></li>

<p>Context: The first known “<strong>virovore</strong>”- an <strong>organism that eats viruses-</strong> has been found.</p>
<p><strong>Key findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Two plankton organisms named <strong>Halteria and Paramecium</strong>, can not only feed on viruses but also <strong>thrive by consuming them.</strong> </li>
<li>Scientists found that a <strong>species of Halteria</strong> – which are microscopic ciliates that populate freshwater throughout the world – <strong>can eat huge numbers of infectious chloroviruses</strong>. Both share an aquatic habitat.</li>
<li>The research also notes the <strong>different patterns of consumption between Halteria and Paramecium</strong> as the formerly used <strong>chlorovirus as a source of nutrients and while the latter did consume the viruses, it did not grow much in population.</strong> </li>
<li>Additionally, the consumption of chloroviruses could have a profound impact on the carbon cycle</li>
