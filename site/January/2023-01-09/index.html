<h4 id="gs-paper-1"><strong>GS Paper 1</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus: Geophysical Phenomenon</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/heres-whats-known-about-how-climate-change-fuels-tropical-cyclones/article66352721.ece"><strong>The Hindu</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: It is clear that <strong>climate change increases the upper limit on hurricane strength</strong> and <strong>rain rate</strong> and that it also <strong>raises the average sea level and therefore storm surge.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Factors that fuels tropical cyclones:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rainfall: Temperature has a clear influence</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The temperature of both the <strong>ocean and atmosphere are critical to hurricane development</strong>.</li>
<li>Hurricanes are powered by the <strong>release of heat when water that evaporates from the ocean’s surface condenses into the storm’s rain.</strong></li>
<li>A warmer o<strong>cean produces more evaporation, which means more water is available to the atmosphere.</strong> A warmer atmosphere can hold more water, which allows more rain.</li>
<li>More rain means more heat is released, and more heat released means stronger winds.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Storm surge</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The rise in <strong>water at a coast caused by a storm</strong> – is related to a number of factors including <strong>storm speed, storm size, wind direction and coastal sea bottom topography. Climate change could have at least two important influences</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="gs-paper-1_1"><strong>GS Paper 1</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Important Geophysical Phenomena/Disaster Management</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/geology-to-unplanned-construction-decoding-why-joshimath-is-sinking-101673028772987.html"><strong>HT</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Direction: T</strong>he article examines the causes of the recent incidents of land subsidence in Joshimath, as well as the preventive measures that are required.</p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Uttarakhand government has banned construction work in and around Joshimath due to land subsidence, which has resulted in cracks in over 560 homes, prompting panicked locals to protest.</li>
<li>Joshimath is the starting point for many Himalayan Mountain climbing expeditions, pilgrimage sites such as Badrinath and Hemkund Sahib</li>
<li>It is the location of one of <strong>Adi Shankara’s</strong> four cardinal monasteries.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/joshimath.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/joshimath.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Science behind the subsidence:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Location, topography:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Also known as Jyotirmath, it is a town (of over 20,000 population) in the <strong>Garhwal Himalayas</strong> in <strong>Chamoli</strong> District in <strong>Uttarakhand</strong>, located on the NH-7 (Rishikesh-Badrinath) at an altitude of <strong>1890</strong></li>
<li>It is situated in the middle slopes of a hill bounded by the Karmanasa and Dhaknala streams on the west and the east and the <strong>Dhauliganga and Alaknanda rivers</strong> on the south and the north.</li>
<li>According to the <strong>Mishra Commission report</strong> (1976), the first instance of subsidence in Joshimath was reported way back in <strong>1976</strong> and the town is –<ul>
<li>Located on the site of <strong>ancient landslides</strong></li>
<li>Covered with thick layer of overburden material</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The town area is prone to landslides and highly vulnerable</strong> to sinking due to scattered and highly weathered gneissic rocks with a low bearing capacity and loose soil due to seepage from streams uphill.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Extreme weather events:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Flood events</strong> of June 2013 and February 2021 (flooding of Rishi Ganga) had adverse impact on the landslide zone as a result of <strong>extreme erosion.</strong></li>
<li>According to the latest satellite data, <strong>mountain streams have expanded their channels and changed course</strong>, thereby inducing more slope instability in an already fragile belt.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Geology:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>According to the Uttarakhand State Disaster Management Authority (USDMA), Joshimath falls in <strong>Zone V</strong> of the Seismic Zonation Map and has witnessed several earthquakes of magnitude of less than 5 on the Richter scale.</li>
<li><strong>Joshimath being on a fault line</strong> makes it highly vulnerable to sinking because of tectonic activity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Unplanned construction:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Border Roads Organisation (BRO) is building the <strong>Helang bypass</strong> that will reduce the distance to Badrinath shrine by about 30 km, using heavy machinery.</li>
<li><strong>Hydroelectric (HE) schemes</strong> have been sanctioned around Joshimath and Tapovan, including the Vishnugad HE Project and a <strong>tunnel boring machine</strong> (TBM) was employed for excavating the tunnel for the project.</li>
<li>In 2009, <strong>it punctured a water-bearing strata</strong> and experts had warned that this sudden and large-scale dewatering of the strata had the potential of initiating ground subsidence in the region.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Improper water drainage:</strong> According to the USDMA, this could be the reason for increase in ground seepage of water from the surface, which is a probable cause for subsidence.</p>
<p><strong>Preventive measures:</strong></p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-2"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus: Indian Society/ Social justice</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/wealth/asian-societies-age-retirement-just-means-more-work"><strong>Businesstimes</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> With populations across <strong>East Asia declining and fewer young people entering</strong> the workforce, workers are working well into their 70s and beyond.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of an ageing society:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>On Finance</strong>: Early retirement ages have bloated the pension bills, making it difficult for governments in Asia to pay retirees enough money.</li>
<li><strong>On Workplace:</strong> Companies desperately need workers, and older employees desperately need the work. Thereby the working age has gone beyond 70 years.</li>
<li><strong>On rising poverty</strong>: In South Korea, the poverty rate among older people is close to <strong>40 per cent</strong></li>
<li><strong>On Jobs:</strong> Many older workers engage in precarious, low-wage contract jobs after being forced out of their long-term employment by low retirement ages.</li>
<li><strong>On Successions Plans</strong>: Many owners of firms in Japan in their <strong>mid-seventies have chosen to accelerate plans</strong> to either hand over control or watch their cherished firms disappear.<ul>
<li>As a consequence, Japan faces the <strong>most extensive evaporation of know-how and institutional memory</strong> in modern history.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is ageing?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ageing</strong> is an irreversible, continuous, universal process, by which an individual’s <strong>productive contribution declines</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Status of Ageing in India?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>India is ageing much faster than previously thought and is expected to have nearly <strong>20% population</strong> of the <strong>world’s 60 years.</strong></li>
<li>This will increase India’s dependency ratio <strong>from 9.8 (one of the lowest currently) to 20.3</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is Active Ageing?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Active ageing</strong> is a concept (deployed by the <strong>European Commission and WHO)</strong> for longer activity, with a higher retirement age and working practices adapted to the age of the employee. It sees the ageing population as the <strong>demographic dividend</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/activd.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/activd.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Some of the Government measures for Elderly Population</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/inv.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/inv.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Steps taken for Active ageing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Community support: Germany</strong> is one of the <strong>super-aged societies</strong> but the Elderly are organized into community participants. They take care of children, discuss the important matter and suggest policy initiatives in their community meetings</li>
<li><strong>Trade Union support</strong>: In Japan and South Korea, temporary job agencies and unions have formed to support older labourers.</li>
<li><strong>Government support</strong>: The Japanese government now provides <strong>subsidies to small- and medium-sized companies</strong> that install accommodations for older workers, such as additional railings on staircases or extra rest areas for workers.</li>
<li><strong>Increasing Retirement Age:</strong> Ireland plans to increase the retirement age to 68 years by 2028.</li>
<li><strong>Catering to the problems of elderly women:</strong> By ensuring women’s property and inheritance rights, promoting literacy rate among elder women, and paying special attention to the rights of marginalized and Transgender women</li>
<li><strong>Technology measures</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Use of Data-driven policy for more age-inclusive government interventions:</strong>g. Data on old-age homeless persons can help decide the number of Old Age Homes required in the area</li>
<li><strong>Technological empowerment of the elderly:</strong> Integrating older persons with digital technologies will help them become self-dependent on their needs.</li>
<li>g. <strong>PMGDISHA</strong> can be extended for the digital literacy of Elderly persons</li>
<li><strong>Japan</strong> is using robots for elderly care. e.g., <strong>Paro</strong>, a robot seal made in Japan can be used to mitigate <strong>loneliness and dementia in the Elderly</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tele-Health</strong> can be used for elderly care in far and remote areas</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Financial security</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Enhancing Social security of the Elderly:</strong> Experts say that pension for the elderly is currently too meagre and should be at least 50% more than the minimum wage for older persons.<ul>
<li>Also, Pensions must be <strong>indexed to inflation</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>CSR funds</strong> can be incorporated to support elderly care</li>
<li><strong>A Universal Pension scheme</strong> for the elderly will help reduce the fiscal burden for elderly care as well as create a culture of long-term saving and investments</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Behavioural change:</strong> By treating Elders as an asset to society and using innovative means such as <strong>Switzerland’s Time-Bank</strong><ul>
<li>Under this bank, <strong>young people bank their time</strong> by taking care of seniors which they can utilize when they get old or fall sick or need someone to take care of them</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Thus India faces <strong>unprecedented population ageing</strong> due to lengthening lifespans, but this also presents an opportunity for India to bring about complex and ambitious changes in health, fiscal and social policies. Active ageing should be a government priority together with making a long-term policy for Old age. The <strong>Elderly in India report 2021</strong> by MOSPI is a welcome step in this regard.</p>
<p><strong>Insta Mains:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q. India is ageing much faster than previously thought, but unlike many countries, preparation for active ageing is not a priority in India. Highlighting the statement, suggest various measures to address the challenge posed by unprecedented population ageing. (15M)</strong></p>

<h3 id="values-that-make-us-human"><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/09/values-that-make-us-human/">Values that make us Human</a></h3>
<h4 id="gs-paper-4"><strong>GS Paper 4</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus: Human Values</strong></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Rising incidents of brutality in society (E.g. Shraddha Murder Case, Delhi – Hit and Drag case) have questioned our <strong>understanding regarding Human Values.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is Value?</strong></p>
<p>Value means the <strong>worth or utility of a thing</strong>.</p>
<p>According to Rokeach, “<strong>Value is an enduring belief, a specific mode of conduct or an end state of existence, along a continuum of relative importance</strong>.”</p>
<p><strong>What are Human Values?</strong></p>
<p>When we associate the <strong>worth or utility of human attributes in life or personality, we refer to them as Human Values.</strong> Simply put, <strong>values which make us Human</strong>.</p>
<p>It promotes harmonious living as well as guides our relationship with the environment across.</p>
<p>In this article, we will be emphasising on value of service to humanity.</p>
<p><strong>Value of service to humanity</strong></p>
<p><strong>Example: Mother Teresa</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One of the greatest <strong>humanitarians of the 20th century</strong>, she devoted her life serving the poorest of the poor. She was a <strong>ray of hope for many, including the aged, the destitute, the unemployed, the diseased, the terminally ill, and those abandoned by their families</strong>.</li>
<li>In 1979, she was <strong>awarded the Nobel Peace Prize</strong> “for work undertaken in the struggle to overcome poverty and distress, which also constitutes a threat to peace.” <strong>She didn’t attend the ceremonial banquet but asked that the $192,000 fund be given to the poor.</strong></li>
<li>Mother Teresa was awarded India’s highest civilian award<strong>, the Bharat Ratna</strong>, on January 25, 1980, <strong>for her humanitarian work.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example: COVID Pandemic</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This sense of service as key to the human relationship got sharply defined during the pandemic. To <strong>care for and serve somebody without any prejudice or immediate interest became the calling card of compassion</strong>.</li>
<li>The values of interpersonal relationships, community bonding, and intrapersonal relationships emerged larger than life.</li>
<li>Swami Vivekananda affirmed <strong>that “if one wants to find God, serve man. To reach Narayana, one must serve the Daridra Narayan.”</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why do we study Human Values as aspiring bureaucrats?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Governance is based on the ideals of justice, transparency, and the spirit of civil service</strong>. It is expected that a civil servant must carry <strong>those human feelings or attributes which can do justice and take care of the needs of the last person in society.</strong></li>
<li>A civil servant must exhibit the <strong>values of empathy, transparency, trust, integrity, courage, and many other human values in the execution or decision-making process</strong>.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong>  The night sky is dark but it glows itself in a coloured mix of green, yellow and red.</p>
<p><strong>About Airglow:</strong></p>
<p>The glow produced by atoms and molecules in the atmosphere is called airglow.</p>
<p>The distinct colours of airglow are the result of <strong>atoms and molecules releasing particular amounts of energy (quanta) in the form of light.</strong></p>
<p>In visible light,</p>
<ul>
<li>Oxygen produces green and red light.</li>
<li>Hydroxyl (OH) molecules produce red light.</li>
<li>Sodium produces a sickly yellow.</li>
<li>Nitrogen does not contribute much to airglow.</li>
</ul>
<p>At high altitudes ultraviolet light can split oxygen molecules (O₂) into pairs of oxygen atoms.</p>
<p>When these oxygen atoms later recombine into <strong>oxygen molecules, they produce a distinct green light.</strong></p>
<p>Sodium atoms make up a minuscule fraction of our atmosphere, but they make up a big part of airglow.</p>
<p>These sodium atoms in atmosphere unusually originates from the smoke trails of shooting stars.</p>

<p><strong>Related News:</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bihar government</strong> started the first phase of the <strong>caste-based survey in the State</strong> on 7th Jan 2023.</p>
<p><strong>What is the Socio-economic survey of all castes and communities (SECC)?</strong></p>
<p>SECC was conducted in <strong>2011</strong> for the <strong>first time since 1931</strong> to canvass every Indian family, both in rural and urban India, and ask about their Economic status and their specific caste name.</p>
<p><strong>Importance of SECC:</strong> It will allow <strong>Central and State authorities</strong> to come up with a range of indicators of social and economic deprivation to define a poor or deprived person.</p>
<p><strong>What is the difference Between Census &amp; SECC?</strong></p>
<p>Census provides data about the <strong>Indian population</strong>. Since the Census falls under the Census Act of 1948, all data are considered <strong>confidential</strong></p>
<p>However, SECC is a tool to identify beneficiaries of state support and all the personal information given in the SECC <strong>is open for use by Government departments</strong> to grant and/or restrict benefits to households.</p>
<p><strong>Consider the following statements: ( UPSC 2009)</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Between Census 1951 and Census 2001, the density of the population of India has increased more than three times.</li>
<li>Between the Census of 1951 and the Census of 2001, the annual growth rate (exponential) of the population of India has doubled.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Which of the statements given above is/are correct?</strong></p>
<p>(a) 1 only<br />
(b) 2 only<br />
(c) Both 1 and 2<br />
(d) Neither 1 nor 2</p>
<p><strong>Ans: (d)</strong></p>
<p>The population density of India in 2001 was <strong>324 persons</strong> per square kilometre and in 1951 it was 117.</p>
<p>The average Annual Growth Rate in <strong>2001</strong> was <strong>1.93 whereas in 1951 it was 1.25</strong>. Thus, it increased, but not doubled.</p>

<h3 id="iiser-punes-new-material-removes-pollutants-from-water"><strong>IISER Pune’s new material removes pollutants from water</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/iiser-punes-new-material-removes-pollutants-from-water/article66346185.ece"><strong>The Hindu</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: Team at <strong>Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune</strong> came up with a <strong>custom-designed unique molecular sponge-like material</strong> — macro/microporous ionic organic framework, which can swiftly clean, <strong>polluted water by soaking up contaminants.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>How does it work:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Commonly utilised sorbent materials often trap these pollutants through ion-exchange strategy to purify water but suffer from poor kinetics and specificity. To mitigate this issue, <strong>IISER has prepared a newly engineered material called viologen-unit grafted organic-framework (iVOFm).</strong></li>
<li>The material employs <strong>amalgamation of electrostatics driven ion-exchange</strong> combined with <strong>nanometer-sized macropores</strong> and specific binding sites for the targeted pollutants. The size and number of <strong>tunable macropores along with the strong electrostatic interaction of iVOFm can quickly remove various toxic pollutants from water.</strong></li>
<li>The fast pollutant trapping capacity <strong>is attributed to faster diffusion of pollutants</strong> through the <strong>ordered interconnected presence of macropores in the material.</strong></li>
<li>This cationic compound is <strong>adaptable for sequestering various pollutants and is a possible solution to the water pollution problem.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Context: THE PEOPLE’S Anti-Fascist Front (PAFF) (</strong>an affiliate of Pakistani terror group Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) and <strong>The Resistance Front (TRF)  (an</strong> off-shoot of the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT)) were <strong>declared as a terrorist organisation</strong> under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), 1967, by the Ministry of Home Affairs.</p>
<p><strong>What is TRF?</strong></p>
<p>TRF began as an online entity in the aftermath of the abrogation of Article 370 and the revocation of special status to Jammu and Kashmir. It soon launched its on-ground activities together with other groups such as Tehreek-e-Millat Islamia and Ghaznavi Hind, apart from the Lashkar.</p>
<p><strong>What is PAFF?</strong></p>
<p>According to a notification issued by the MHA, the <strong>PAFF emerged in 2019</strong> as a proxy outfit of JeM, a proscribed terrorist organisation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Both organizations have been formed as a front organization to deflect the global attention from LeT and JeM activities. Previously, FATF had put Pakistan on the ‘grey list’ for terror funding.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About UAPA Act:</strong></p>
<p>This act gives power to the government to declare any organization as an “<strong>unlawful association” or a “terrorist organization</strong>”.</p>
