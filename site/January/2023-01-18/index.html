<h4 id="gs-paper-1"><strong>GS Paper 1</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Population and Associated Issues</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/china-population-shrinks-for-first-time-in-over-60-years/article66385397.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Direction:</strong> The article highlights the shifts in the population of India (increasing) and China (decreasing) and the implications of the shift.</p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>According to China’s National Bureau of Statistics, its population fell to 1,411.8 million in 2022, from 1,412.6 million in the previous year.</li>
<li>This is a landmark event, for a country that is soon set to be surpassed by India (as per UN projections, India’s population is expected to reach 1,428.6 million in 2023) as home to the greatest number of people.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What has been behind these shifts?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mortality:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A country’s population increases with a <strong>reduction in the relative number of deaths</strong>, while population growth slows/reverses with <strong>declining fertility rates.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The crude death rate</strong> (CDR) – the number of persons dying per year per 1,000 population – was 23.2 for China in 1950 (22.2 for India). It fell to single digits of 7.3 in 2020 (7.4 for India).</li>
<li>Another mortality indicator is <strong>life expectancy at birth</strong>. Between 1950 and 2020, it went up from 43.7 to 78.1 years for China and from 41.7 to 70.1 years for India.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fertility:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The total fertility rate</strong> (TFR) – the number of babies an average woman (aged 15-49) bears over her lifetime – was as high as 5.8 for China and 5.7 for India in 1950.<ul>
<li>According to its 2020 Census, China’s TFR was 1.3 births per woman.</li>
<li>The TFR has fallen sharply for India too (from 3.4 to 2 between 1992-93 and 2019-21).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A TFR of 2.1 is considered as “<strong>replacement-level fertility</strong>” – a woman having two children replaces herself and her partner with two new lives.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why is India’s population increasing, while China’s shrinking?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>China’s One-Child Policy (1980 to 2015):</strong> This has helped China to prevent nearly 400 million births.</li>
<li><strong>Sustained lows necessary:</strong> De-growth requires TFRs to remain below replacement levels for extended periods and it will reflect only after a couple of generations.<ul>
<li>China’s TFR dipped below replacement first in 1991, which was almost 30 years before India’s.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="gs-paper-2"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>International Relations, Security Challenges and their Management in Border Areas – Linkages of Organized Crime with Terrorism</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/un-anti-terror-committee-blacklists-lets-abdul-rehman-makki/article66385426.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a> </p>
<p><strong>Direction:</strong> The article highlights the significance of international counterterrorism cooperation to curb terrorist threats and dismantle terror infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The UN Security Council’s (UNSC) <strong>1267 Al Qaeda Sanctions Committee</strong> added 68-year-old Abdul Rehman Makki to its list of designated terrorists upon China withdrew its ‘ technical hold’.</li>
<li>Pakistan-based Makki is the deputy chief of the terror outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba and the brother-in-law of its founder (Hafiz Saeed).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>During India’s two-year (2021-22) tenure at the UNSC</strong>, five names were designated under the ISIL and Al Qaeda Sanctions Committee including Abdul Rehman Makki (LeT).</li>
<li>These names faced a “<strong>technical hold</strong>” from China, while the other 14 members (permanent + non-permanent) of the UNSC supported the listing.</li>
<li>India and the US have <strong>listed Makki as a terrorist under their respective national laws.</strong></li>
<li>In October 2022, Pakistan was removed from the grey list.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the 1267 Al Qaeda Sanctions Committee?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The committee is part of the UNSC</strong> and its job is <strong>to implement international sanctions</strong> against terrorists.</li>
<li>It was established as the Al-Qaida and Taliban Sanctions Committee in <strong>1999</strong> after <strong>UNSC Resolution 1267 designated</strong> Al-Qaeda and the Taliban as terrorist bodies. In 2011, a separate committee was formed for the Taliban.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What does the UN’s blacklisting of terrorists imply?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Resolution 1267 was adopted under Chapter VII of the UN Charter and requires all UN member states to –<ul>
<li>Freeze the assets,</li>
<li>Prevent the entry into or transit through their territories, and</li>
<li>Prevent the direct or indirect supply, sale and transfer of arms and military equipment to any individual or entity associated with Al-Qaida.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is conducive to <strong>enhancing international counterterrorism cooperation</strong> in response to terrorist threats.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance for India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Threats from terrorist organisations in the region remain high</strong>. (Makki being linked to seven terror attacks in India)</li>
<li>Listings and sanctions by the UNSC are effective tools to <strong>curb such threats and dismantle terror infrastructure</strong> in the region.</li>
<li><strong>It validates India’s commitment to a zero-tolerance policy toward terrorism</strong>.</li>
<li>It will also inspire India to press the international community to take credible, verifiable, and irreversible action against terrorism.</li>
</ul>
<p>FATF:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is an <strong>intergovernmental</strong> organisation founded in <strong>1989</strong> on the initiative of the G7 to develop policies <strong>to combat money laundering</strong>.</li>
<li>In 2001, its mandate was expanded to include terror financing.</li>
<li><strong>Headquarters</strong>: It operates from Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) headquarters in Paris.</li>
<li><strong>Member Countries</strong>: It has 39 members (including India) including two regional organisations – the EU and GCC (Gulf cooperation council)</li>
<li><strong>Sessions</strong>: Its plenary (decision-making body) meets three times per year.</li>
<li><strong>Lists under FATF:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Grey List:</strong> It serves as a warning for the countries considered a safe haven for supporting terror funding and money laundering.</li>
<li><strong>Black List:</strong> High-risk countries and Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories (NCCTs) are put on the blacklist. E.g., Iran, Myanmar and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Syllabus</strong>: Ecology</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/how-can-human-disturbance-alter-habitats-and-routines-of-animals-8387711/"><strong>Indian Express</strong></a><strong>,</strong> <a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/climate-change/ants-can-t-alter-behaviour-to-deal-with-warmer-climate-report-87175"><strong>DTE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: A new finding on animal behaviours</p>
<p><strong>An animal must be at the right place, at the right time, to avoid predators, find food, and reproduce successfully</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>As an analogy</strong>: The interactions between the animals in a given ecosystem are like a theatrical production. For the production to be a success, each actor has to be on stage, in the right place, and they must act and deliver their lines at the right time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Threats</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>As per the new study, <strong>human activities might disturb these ecological interactions</strong> and increase interspecies encounters.</li>
<li><strong>Impact of farms</strong>: Wild animals of different species were more likely to come to human-altered landscapes, like farms than in more undisturbed locations, such as national forests.</li>
<li><strong>Frequent interaction can lead to intensifying competition</strong> for resources or increasing the risk of interspecies disease transmission.</li>
<li>Even when the animals do not come face-to-face, simply hearing or smelling a predator can have <strong>“dramatic effects” on the behaviours of prey species</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is an ecological niche?</strong></p>
<p>In ecology, the term <strong>“niche”</strong> describes the role <strong>an organism plays in a community</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>What is an Ecosystem?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ecosys.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ecosys-1024x511.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>In another study (DTE), it has been found that:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ants may be unable to adapt to global warming</strong>, leaving them highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.</li>
<li>The insects are <strong>cold-blooded creatures</strong>, also called <strong>ectotherms</strong>. Their body temperatures depend on <strong>external sources</strong> like sunlight. <strong>Humans</strong> (<strong>endotherms</strong>), on the other hand, <strong>maintain their body temperature</strong> without relying on the environment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Importance of Ants:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ants are often called <strong>“ecosystem’s engineers</strong>”. These insects move the soil during nest-building and foraging, affecting the level of nutrients in it.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="gs-paper-3_1"><strong>GS Paper 3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Role of Media and Social Networking Sites in Internal Security Challenges</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/news-marked-false-by-pib-to-be-taken-down-draft-rule/article66388405.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Direction:</strong> The article tries to cover the larger issue of fake news in India along with ways to curb fake news and some best practices.</p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) proposed a draft rule – Rule 3(1)(b)(v) of the amended version of the <strong>IT (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules 2021.</strong></li>
<li>The proposed rule requires social media platforms to take down content that has been “fact-checked” by the Press Information Bureau’s (PIB) fact-check unit (or any other agency authorised by the Central Government) as false.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> The amended version of the IT Rules 2021 was enlarged to include the removal of fake news from online intermediaries.</p>
<p><strong>The larger issue of fake news in India:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Meaning:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fake news is any piece of <strong>misleading maliciously false information</strong> circulating through print media, electronic media or social media.</li>
<li>‘<strong>Yellow Journalism</strong>’ and ‘<strong>Tabloid Journalism</strong>’ are the terms used for fake news.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Motive:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>T<strong>o increase their viewership and TRP</strong> through eye-catching headlines and cooked-up news.</li>
<li>To spread <strong>propaganda/personal agenda/image building/defaming</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Negative impact on <strong>law and order</strong> of the state as well as the <strong>safety and security</strong> of the citizens. (31 mob lynchings due to fake news of being child abductors)</li>
<li>Breed <strong>communal hatred</strong> and disturbs the <strong>communal harmony</strong> in a society.</li>
<li>Affects the <strong>election outcomes</strong> via fabricated articles, audio, videos, and election campaigns. (Fake news accused of tampering U.S Presidential elections)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Laws to curb fake news:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Section 66 D of the <strong>IT Act 2008</strong> regulates offences related to electronic communication.</li>
<li><strong>The Disaster Management Act 2005</strong> and the Epidemic Diseases Act 1897 (especially during Covid-19) regulate the circulation of fake news or rumours that can cause panic among citizens.</li>
<li><strong>The Indian Penal Code of 1860</strong> regulates fake news that causes riots and information that causes defamation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges in curbing fake news:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>India has 622 million</strong> active monthly internet users and the role of the different social digital platforms is on the rise.<ul>
<li><strong>Due to end-to-end encryption</strong> of messages, third parties will not have any access to these messages.</li>
<li>Hence, such fake news comes to the attention of the administration only <strong>if it is reported.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is <strong>no dedicated fake news law.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The use of internet shutdowns</strong> to curb the spreading of fake news has been an effective way.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Concerns related to Rule 3(1)(b)(v) of the amended version of the IT Rules 2021:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Anything contradicted by the government might be used to justify-content takedowns.</li>
<li><strong>The PIB’s fact-checking unit</strong> (established in 2019) verifies news about government ministries, departments, and schemes.<ul>
<li>But <strong>it rarely explains</strong> why information has been identified as false or misleading and, on some occasions, it tweeted incorrect information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A very strict fake news law is the need of the hour.</li>
<li>L<strong>inking Aadhar to social media accounts, as suggested by Attorney General could be helpful.</strong></li>
<li>Being a digitally responsible citizen –<ul>
<li>By just rechecking the information from some authentic sources</li>
<li>By applying common sense without getting biased</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Some best practices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Facebook has partnered with a fact-checking website</strong> to check the authenticity of messages circulating through it.</li>
<li>In 2018, <strong>Google news trained 8000 journalists</strong> in different Indian languages to spread awareness about Fake news and fact-checking.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: Astronomers from McGill University in Canada and the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in Bengaluru have used <strong>data from the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) in Pune to detect a radio signal originating from atomic hydrogen in an extremely distant galaxy.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>About Atomic Hydrogen:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is the <strong>basic fuel required for star formation in a galaxy</strong>.</li>
<li>When hot ionized gas from the surrounding medium falls onto the galaxy, <strong>the gas cools and forms atomic hydrogen.</strong></li>
<li><strong>It then becomes molecular hydrogen and eventually leads to the formation of stars.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>G<strong>ravitational lensing was used</strong>, in which the light emitted by the source is <strong>bent due to the presence of another massive body</strong> between the target galaxy and the observer, resulting in the “<strong>magnification” of the signal.</strong>  </li>
<li>The <strong>atomic hydrogen mass of this particular galaxy is twice as high as its stellar mass</strong>.</li>
<li>The results demonstrate the feasibility of <strong>observing atomic gas from galaxies at cosmological distances in similar lensed systems with a modest amount of observing time</strong>.</li>
<li>Opens up <strong>exciting new possibilities for probing the cosmic evolution of neutral gas</strong> through low-frequency telescopes.</li>

<p><strong>Context: James Webb Space Telescope has discovered its first new exoplanet</strong>. The planet is named <strong>LHS 475 b, and it is roughly the same size as Earth.</strong></p>
<p><strong>About Exoplanets:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Exoplanets are planets that <strong>orbit other stars and are beyond our solar system</strong>.</li>
<li>If an exoplanet is too close to the star, it might be too hot to sustain liquid water.</li>
<li>If it’s too far, it might only have frozen water.</li>
<li>When a planet is at a distance that <strong>enables it to have liquid water, it is said to be in the “Goldilocks zone”.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why study exoplanets:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Broadens <strong>our understanding of other solar systems</strong></li>
<li>Helps us <strong>piece together information about our own planetary system and origin.</strong></li>
<li>To search for living organisms in the universe.</li>
