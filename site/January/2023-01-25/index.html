<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> Social empowerment</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/developing-schools-without-barriers/article66427806.ece"><strong>The Hindu</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Direction</strong>: Highlight issues and solutions that can be implemented to make schools inclusive for differently-abled children</p>
<p><strong>Issues affecting children with disability/disabilities (CWD):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>‘State of the Education Report for India 2019: Children with Disabilities’</strong> by <strong>UNESCO</strong>mentioned that CWD <strong>comprises 1.7%</strong> of the total child population in India (Census 2011).</li>
<li><strong>Physical</strong>:<ul>
<li>Inaccessible school buses</li>
<li>Inaccessible facilities in schools (drinking water facilities, canteens, and toilets)</li>
<li>Inappropriate infrastructure in classrooms (uncomfortable seating, slippery flooring, and low illumination)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Institutional</strong>: Lack of policy implementation by agencies</li>
<li><strong>Social</strong>: Misinformed attitudes and perceptions among parents, teachers, staff, and communities</li>
<li><strong>Communication</strong> <strong>barriers</strong></li>
<li><strong>Economic</strong> burden and lack of opportunities</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Solutions to deal with these issues:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Policy level:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Actualizing the zero-rejection policy</strong> in schools (e.g., as is done in Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan)</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure should include</strong>: Equitability, Usability, Durability, Affordability, Cultural adaptability, and Aesthetic appeal</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Institutional Level:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Awareness and sensitization programmes</strong> for children, parents, and caregivers</li>
<li><strong>Training trainers for upskilling of school</strong> faculty and special educators</li>
<li><strong>Technical training for local government</strong> departments</li>
<li><strong>A co-learning platform</strong> for knowledge-sharing between all</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Civil Society and organizations</strong>:<ul>
<li><strong>UN-Habitat India: ‘Leave No One Behind’ Project</strong> (main pillar of Accessible India Campaign (Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan))</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Developing inclusive and accessible schools will help challenge perceptions about children with disabilities and actualise the zero-rejection policy in schools</p>

<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Indian Economy and issues relating to Planning, Mobilization of Resources, Growth, Development and Employment</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/oxfam-inequality-report-taxing-obscenely-wealthy-may-not-right-solution-8391292/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Direction:</strong> The article highlights that instead of excessively taxing the wealthy, the need of the hour is to raise the income of all to reduce income inequalities.</p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Evidence of “excessive” wealth concentration and uneven income growth is mentioned in the recently released <strong>Oxfam “Survival of the Richest” report</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>The gap in income recovery</strong> between the top income categories and those at the bottom as a result of the economic crisis post-COVID-19 pandemic.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>India-specific findings in the report:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There are now 166 billionaires, up from <strong>106</strong> in 2020.</li>
<li><strong>The top (30%) earners hold the majority (90%) of the wealth.</strong> This contrasts with the global figure, where it is believed that the richest 1% have amassed about two-thirds of all new wealth.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ramifications of the above findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This can stir the debate for an <strong>equalising wealth tax</strong> (a progressive wealth tax where the tax rate increases as the wealth of an individual increase. The goal is to redistribute wealth and reduce inequality among citizens.)</li>
<li>Oxfam argues that indirect taxes are regressive and suggests –<ul>
<li>A <strong>wealth tax</strong> – a tax on unrealised capital gains and higher taxes on corporates.</li>
<li><strong>Tax on incomes, capital gains and wealth are interrelated</strong> and the changes cannot be recommended in isolation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tax collection depends upon</strong> The mix of taxes that a country raises as a function of its institutional capacity, the structure of the tax base and the desire for simplification.</p>
<p><strong>Case of India – The report raises two important points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The lower corporate tax rate</strong> in lieu of incentives and the introduction of GST – a costly experiment of tax policy in India.<ul>
<li>The corporate tax cuts brought the statutory tax rate down from 30 to 25.17%, leading to a revenue loss of Rs 1.03 lakh crore.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The GST and its disproportionate impact on the lowest earners.</strong><ul>
<li>Oxfam uses NSS 2011-12 to establish that the <strong>bottom 50% pays six times more indirect tax</strong> as compared to the top 10%.</li>
<li>The current income tax system <strong>exempts incomes up to Rs 5 lakh from tax and the GST rate structure places a higher burden on luxuries</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Issues with the Oxfam report’s calculation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Although the report carries the right message about <strong>rising inequalities and the need for tax reform</strong>, it gets lost in assumptions.<ul>
<li><strong>For example</strong>, India will gain 10% more in taxes than it currently collects indirect taxes from the introduction of the wealth tax.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A wealth tax has historically been utilised by nations, including India, <strong>but the revenues were dismal</strong>, making it an expensive tax to operate.</li>
<li>Hence, <strong>a compartmentalised approach to tax policy</strong> that links several taxes that are levied against the same base is meaningless.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong> Taxes do not always solve problems, and <strong>it is important to consider the impact of other macroeconomic measures</strong> like low-interest rates and regulatory actions.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Rather than depending on a tax that depends heavily on volatile asset values, the same goal can be achieved with a gradual increase in wealth and income of all. This will <strong>reduce inequalities without penalising the corporates.</strong></p>
<p><strong>InstaCurious:</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Gini index</strong> measures the extent to which the distribution of income among individuals or households within an economy deviates from a perfectly equal distribution. A Gini index of 0 represents perfect equality, while an index of 100 implies perfect inequality. For India, it was <strong>35.7 in 2019</strong>(World Bank Data)</p>

<p><strong>D</strong><strong>irection:</strong> The article highlights the issues related to the Ken-Betwa Link Project.</p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Steering Committee of the Ken-Betwa Link Project (KBLP), chaired by the Secretary of the Department of Water Resources, Ministry of Jal Shakti, held its third meeting in New Delhi.</p>
<p><strong>What is the KBLP?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/mapping.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/mapping.jpg?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>It is a “flagship” project that is critical for the <strong>water security and socio-economic development of the Bundelkhand region</strong> (of MP and UP).</li>
<li>The project costs Rs 44,605 crore in 2021 to water the Bundelkhand region.</li>
<li>The link will be in the form of a <strong>canal</strong> (flow through Chhatarpur, Tikamgarh and Jhansi districts) that will be fed by the <strong>new Daudhan Dam on the Ken</strong>, to be built <strong>within Panna Tiger Reserve</strong>.</li>
<li>The dam will generate <strong>103 MW of hydroelectric power</strong> and is expected to <strong>irrigate 6.3 lakh hectares</strong> of land every year.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Concerns:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hydrological and ecological concerns:</strong> The ‘surplus and deficit’ model has little basis in science (as these could be seasonal phenomena too) and it may <strong>endanger the water security of the Panna district</strong> (Ken – a non-perennial river).<ul>
<li>The project has not yet received <strong>a complete forest clearance</strong>.</li>
<li>The NGT is currently hearing a challenge to the project’s environmental approval.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The legal problems:</strong><ul>
<li>Approval by the National Board for Wildlife violates Section 35(6) of <strong>the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972</strong> – improvement and better management of wildlife.</li>
<li>According to the SC, the creation of a high reservoir dam on the Ken River in the Panna National Park and Tiger Reserve for the KBLP is ultra vires to the WPA 1972.</li>
<li>The destructive impact of the proposed dam on the flow of water into and outside of the <strong>Ken Gharial Sanctuary</strong> (downstream of the Panna national park) is evident.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Impact on Panna’s tigers and other wildlife:</strong><ul>
<li>The deep gorges of Panna will be drowned if the new dam is built.</li>
<li><strong>By 2009</strong>, there were no tigers in the Panna Tiger Reserve, <strong>necessitating an incredible effort</strong> that lasted almost a decade to reintroduce them.</li>
<li>The key wildlife species that will be affected include <strong>endangered vultures, mahseer fish, and the critically endangered Gangetic gharial</strong> (Gavialis gangeticus) in the Ken Gharial Sanctuary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The government is developing a larger ‘<strong>Panna Tiger Landscape</strong>’, which should be created in any case for Panna’s tigers.</li>
<li>An “<strong>independent</strong>” hydrological investigation of the Ken.</li>
<li><strong>Restoring Bunderlkhand’s erstwhile Chandel-period lakes and ponds</strong>.</li>
<li>The developmental project should not destroy the ecology of fragile ecosystems and important tiger habitats in the country.</li>
<li>The approach should be <strong>eco-centric</strong> and <strong>not anthropocentric</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Due diligence and expert scrutiny during the project-approval stage are cornerstones of sound environmental governance.</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: <strong>Five billion people globally are exposed to harmful trans-fat</strong>, increasing their heart disease and death risk, according to a <strong>new report “Countdown to 2023” by the World Health Organization (WHO).</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The report monitors global progress <strong>towards the 2023 target for the global elimination of industrially produced Trans-Fatty Acids (TFA).</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About TFA:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>TFAs are <strong>unsaturated fatty acids</strong> that are of two types –<ul>
<li><strong>Naturally occurring trans-fat occurs in some dairy and meat products.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Industrially produced</strong> trans-fat adds <strong>hydrogen to liquid vegetable oils to make them more soli</strong> It is found in packaged foods, baked goods, cooking oils and spreads.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Findings from the report:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Trans fat intake is <strong>accountable for up to 500,000 early deaths from coronary heart disease annually.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Nine countries</strong> — Australia, Azerbaijan, Bhutan, Ecuador, Egypt, Iran, Nepal, Pakistan and the Republic of Korea — of the 16 nations with the highest estimated percentage of coronary heart disease fatalities attributed <strong>to trans-fat consumption</strong> do not currently have best-practices strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Two best-practices policy options</strong>:<ul>
<li>Mandatory <strong>national limit of two grams</strong> of industrially produced trans-fat per 100 grams of total fat in all foods;</li>

<p><strong>Harmful effects of TFA:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>TFAs pose a <strong>higher risk of heart disease than saturated fats</strong> – they raise total cholesterol levels, and <strong>reduce the good cholesterol (HDL), which helps to protect one against heart disease.</strong></li>
<li>It is also associated with a higher risk of <strong>developing obesity, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, infertility, and certain types of cancers</strong>and can also lead to compromised fetal development causing harm to the yet-to-be-born baby.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steps taken to regulate TFA:</strong></p>
<p><strong>National:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>FSSAI launched a “<strong>Trans Fat-Free” logo for voluntary labelling</strong> to promote TFA-free products in shops for preparations containing TFA not exceeding 0.2 per 100 g/ml.</li>
<li>Campaign <strong>“Heart Attack Rewind</strong>” to eliminate industrially-produced trans-fat in the food supply by the year 2022.</li>
<li>FSSAI limits the content to <strong>not more than 2% by mass of total oils and fats from January 2022.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Swasth Bharat Yatra, an initiative started under the “Eat Right” campaign</strong> is a Pan-India cyclothon to engage citizens on issues of food safety, combating food adulteration and healthy diets.</li>

<p><strong>Case Study: Cuban HealthCare</strong></p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: Recently, Cuban revolutionary Che Guevara’s daughter Aleida visited India.</p>
<p><strong>Success:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Life expectancy in Cuba</strong> is higher than that of the US (<strong>72.</strong><strong>5 vs. 71.9) (India’s 70.19)</strong></li>
<li>Cuba has eliminated <strong>polio, tuberculosis, typhoid fever, and diphtheria</strong></li>
<li><strong>Malnutrition</strong> incidence among (1-15 years old) is <strong>0..</strong><strong>7%</strong> compared with 5% in the US</li>
<li>Impressively <strong>high ranking on major health indicators</strong>, despite economic handicaps</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How has Cuba developed one of the best healthcare systems?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Government-Run Healthcare:</strong><ul>
<li>The Cuban government operates a <strong>national health system</strong></li>
<li>The Cuban government has assumed <strong>fiscal and administrative</strong> responsibility for the health care of all its citizens.</li>
<li><strong>There are no private hospitals or clinics</strong> as all health services are government-run.</li>
<li>It regards <strong>accessibility to healthcare as a fundamental right</strong> of its citizens.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Preventive Healthcare:</strong><ul>
<li>Cuba’s health policy emphasizes <strong>prevention, primary care, services</strong> in the community, and the active <strong>participation</strong> of citizens.</li>
<li>It offers the simplest check-up to the most complex surgery, free of charge</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>India’s Connection:</strong><ul>
<li>PM Modi’s <strong>‘One Earth-One Health’ proposal</strong> is inspired by the global health philosophy of the late Cuban leader Castro.</li>
<li><strong>Cuba sends surplus physicians (“Army of white coats”)</strong> and health professionals abroad annually (including India): “Cuban doctors are always the first to arrive and the last to leave.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Quote on Healthcare</strong>: Dr Martin Luther King once remarked, “<strong><em>Of the forms of injustice, inequality in healthcare is the most shocking and inhumane.</em></strong>”</p>

<p><strong>ontext:</strong> The farmer’s union, Shetkari Sanghatana, launched a protest over the Securities and Exchange Board of India’s (SEBI) decision to keep the trading of derivatives in seven agricultural commodities suspended.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In 2021, the capital markets regulator suspended futures trading in seven commodities, viz., wheat, paddy (non-basmati), moong, chana, etc., on the exchanges, in an effort <strong>to reduce food inflation</strong>.</li>
<li>The ban was intended to stop speculative trade in these commodities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How does the derivatives trade in commodities work?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Agricultural commodities like cotton, paddy, soybean, soya oil, mustard seed, etc., are traded on the National Commodities and Derivatives Exchange (<strong>NCDEX</strong>) and the Multi Commodity Exchange (<strong>MCX</strong>).</li>
<li><strong>Derivatives are short-term financial contracts</strong> that are bought and sold in the market.</li>
<li>Profits are made <strong>by predicting price movements</strong> of the asset that underlies the contract.</li>
<li>The derivatives trade can be in <strong>futures and options. In a futures contract</strong>, a supplier pledges to sell a certain quantity at a fixed price at a future date.</li>
<li>Also, farmers can put fixed amounts of their produce, which fits the quality standards of the exchange, to be sold at a fixed price – a<strong>lmost like price insurance.</strong></li>
<li>Both contracts can be terminated by either the producer or the trader by paying a margin price to the exchange.</li>
</ul>
