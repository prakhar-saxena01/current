<h4 id="gs-paper-3"><strong>GS Paper 3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Issues relating to Planning, Mobilization of Resources/Infrastructure-Energy/Environmental Conservation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/study-warns-of-risk-to-indian-financial-institutions-from-transition-to-clean-energy-economy/article66419679.ece#:~:text=India's%20financial%20sector%20is%20highly,journal%2C%20published%20online%20last%20week."><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Direction:</strong> The challenges, especially financial, that India faces as it prepares to transition from a high-carbon emission economy to a low-carbon emission economy are discussed in the article.</p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> According to a study in the <strong>Global Environmental Change journal</strong>, India’s financial sector is highly exposed to the risks of the economy transitioning from being largely dependent on fossil fuels to clean energy.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coal</strong> currently accounts for <strong>44% of India’s primary energy</strong> sources and <strong>70% of its power generation.</strong></li>
<li>The country’s coal-fired power plants have an <strong>average age of 13 years</strong> and India has 91,000 MW of new proposed coal capacity in the works, second only to China.</li>
<li>According to <strong>the Draft National Electricity Plan 2022</strong>, coal’s share in the electricity generation mix will decrease to 50% by 2030.</li>
<li>In 2021, the PM of India announced <strong>India’s commitment</strong> to reach <strong>net-zero emissions by 2070</strong> and to source half of its electricity needs from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Highlights of the study:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The financial decisions</strong> of Indian banks and institutional investors are forcing the nation to rely on a more expensive, more polluting source of energy. <strong>For example,</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Oil and gas extraction</strong> accounted for 60% of lending to the mining industry, while <strong>petroleum refining</strong> accounted for one-fifth of debt in the manufacturing industry.</li>
<li><strong>Only 17.5% of bank lending</strong> to the power sector has been to renewables.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consequently, <strong>India has much higher electricity from carbon sources</strong> than the world average, despite its vast potential for cheap solar, wind, and small hydropower.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>High-carbon industries</strong> – power generation, chemicals, iron and steel, and aviation – account for 10% of outstanding debt to Indian financial institutions.<ul>
<li>However, these industries are also heavily indebted and therefore <strong>have the less financial capacity to respond to shocks and stresses</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mapping India’s policy commitments against these lending and investment patterns reveal that <strong>India’s financial sector is heavily exposed to potential transition risks.</strong></li>
<li><strong>A shortage of experts in India’s financial institutions</strong> who had the expertise to appropriately advise the institutions on such a transition.</li>
<li><strong>Trillion dollars needed:</strong> To meet net-zero and power generation from non-fossil fuel sources commitments.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In general, the following are a few reasons a nation’s economy may be at risk from moving to clean energy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>High upfront costs:</strong> The initial investment required to transition to clean energy, such as building solar or wind power plants, can be significant.</li>
<li><strong>Job losses in certain industries:</strong> This could have negative effects on the economy and could lead to higher unemployment.</li>
<li><strong>Dependence on foreign technology:</strong> Many countries may have to import clean energy technology from other nations, which can be expensive.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of infrastructure:</strong> The transition to clean energy requires a significant overhaul of the existing energy infrastructure, which may be costly and time-consuming.</li>
<li><strong>Uncertainty of investments and regulations:</strong> The transition to clean energy may be slowed down by the lack of clear regulations and policy frameworks, which can make it difficult for companies to make long-term investments.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Financiers, regulators and policymakers</strong> should be acting swiftly to ensure an orderly transition to net zero.</li>
<li>RBI is expected to launch India’s <strong>first-ever sovereign green bonds auction</strong> worth ₹40 billion.</li>
<li><strong>India’s presidency of the G-20</strong> also means a focus on the energy transition and mobilising sustainable finance.</li>
<li>Major financial institutions should collect information on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks and <strong>systematically incorporate data into financial planning.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> There is a linkage between financial risk, renewable energy technology budgets, and environmental quality as the transition to clean energy can have an impact on all three areas.</p>
<p>Shifting financial resources towards these renewables would deliver huge benefits for India like cheaper electricity, cleaner air, and fewer emissions. Thus, on the other side of risk is a <strong>tremendous opportunity.</strong></p>

<p><strong>ESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance.</strong> It refers to a set of standards for a company’s operations that socially conscious investors use to screen potential investments. Environmental standards assess a company’s impact on the natural world. Social standards assess a company’s impact on its employees, customers, and community. Governance standards assess a company’s leadership, financial transparency, and ethical behaviour. ESG criteria can help investors evaluate the long-term sustainability of a company and its potential financial performance.</p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-2"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Issues Relating to Development and Management of Social Sector/Services relating to Health</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/explained-indias-plan-to-eradicate-measles-rubella/article66418395.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Direction:</strong> The article highlights what needs to be done as well as the efforts made by India to eradicate measles and rubella.</p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> India set a goal (in 2019) to eradicate measles and rubella (MR) by 2023 after missing the previous deadline of 2020 (an earlier target of 2015 was also missed) for a number of reasons, worsened by the pandemic’s disruptions.</p>
<p>Measles and Rubella:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/measles_1.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/measles_1.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rubella isn’t the same as measles</strong>, but the two illnesses share some signs and symptoms, such as the <strong>red rash</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Rubella is not as contagious or harmful</strong> as measles and is brought on by a different virus.</li>
<li>While measles has a <strong>high fatality rate, rubella infection in a pregnant woman will have an impact on the foetus</strong>, resulting in birth defects.</li>
<li><strong>The measles-mumps-rubella</strong> (MMR) vaccine is highly effective in preventing MR and provides lifelong protection against them.</li>
<li>Over the past two decades, the measles vaccine is estimated to have <strong>averted more than 30 million deaths globally.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why is eliminating MR crucial?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>According to the WHO, <strong>the measles virus</strong> is one of the world’s most contagious human viruses that kills more than 1,00,000 children every year globally and rubella is a leading cause of birth defects.</li>
<li>An outbreak of measles in <strong>Maharashtra in 2022, particularly in Mumbai</strong>, killed 15 children among several hundred who contracted the infection.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What has India done to achieve targets?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>During 2010-2013</strong>, India conducted a phased measles catch-up immunisation for children aged 9 months-10 years in 14 States, vaccinating approximately 119 million children.</li>
<li><strong>Mission Indradhanush</strong> was launched in 2014 to ramp up vaccinating the unvaccinated population.</li>
<li><strong>During 2017–2021</strong>, India adopted a national strategic plan for MR elimination, and introduced rubella-containing vaccine (RCV) into the routine immunisation programme, besides launching a nationwide MR supplementary immunisation activity (SIA) catch-up campaign.<ul>
<li>Additionally, it changed the focus of acute fever and rash surveillance from <strong>outbreak-based to case-based.</strong></li>
<li>Also, the number of laboratories in the MR network has more than doubled.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What needs to be done to achieve the target?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The main concern is the under-one-year population. But if the <strong>immunisation at 95%</strong> can be maintained, it will be possible.</li>
<li>However, it needs to be done <strong>district by district</strong> –<ul>
<li>Give each district a target to achieve the required rate of immunisation,</li>
<li>Conduct a robust fever and rash surveillance programme, testing for MR.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Monitoring the progress and <strong>providing additional inputs</strong> to the districts that are lagging in implementing the immunisation.</li>
<li>In the process, <strong>it is important to provide full support</strong> (improve their service conditions, and salaries) <strong>to the ground-level staff</strong> (village health nurses, ASHA, Anganwadi and ICDS workers) who implement the programme.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Having <strong>strong immunisation infrastructure, States like Tamil Nadu and Kerala</strong> will find it easier to reach the targets, unlike the other States where more effort will be needed to do so.</li>
<li>As the saying goes – “<strong>a threat of infection anywhere is a threat everywhere</strong>,” India needs to improve its surveillance by finding, investigating, collecting, and testing a sample for every suspected case in every district across every State and UT.</li>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/jacinda-ardern-the-woman-who-defied-realpolitik/article66417940.ece"><strong>The Hindu</strong></a><strong>,</strong> <a href="https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/jacinda-ardern-has-given-the-world-a-big-lesson-in-humility-11674405993370.html"><strong>Live Mint</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: New Zealand’s Prime Minister, <strong>Jacinda Ardern</strong> who announced her resignation citing burnout, <strong>offered an alternative leadership model rooted in a moral vision rather than political opportunism</strong> and rose to become a global hero of liberalism.</p>
<ul>
<li>She is considered a classic example of <strong>ethical leadership.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/leader.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/leader.jpg?is-pending-load=1" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>About Ethical Leadership:</strong></p>
<p>Ethical leadership is the practice of <strong>demonstrating appropriate conduct inside and outside the office</strong>. It is mainly concerned with <strong>moral development and virtuous behaviour</strong>. Ethical leaders display good values through their words and actions.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ethic_leder.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ethic_leder.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Lessons from the life of Jacinda Ardern:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motherhood is powerful</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Jacinda Ardern became the <strong>second world leader (After Benazir Bhutto) to ever give birth and subsequently take maternity leave while in office</strong>. She said, <strong>“I’m just pregnant, not incapacitated</strong>”.</li>
<li><strong>Multitasking:</strong> The Prime Minister then made history and headlines worldwide when <strong>her three-month-old child accompanied her to a United Nations General Assembly in New York City.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Keeping calm under pressure</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The New Zealand Prime Minister has demonstrated her ability to <strong>stay cool numerous times throughout the coronavirus pandemic, but it was her response to a 5.8 magnitude earthquake</strong> that set the tone for her approach to a crisis. During a live television broadcast, the parliament building she was in was hit with a mammoth natural disaster.</li>
<li>Her ability to immediately <strong>gather her thoughts and address a crisis can be a learning lesson for all of us.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Act swiftly, decisively and do not downplay situations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Her decisiveness during the COVID-19 pandemic had a huge impact on how the <strong>country handled the crisis and the measures she implemented.</strong></li>
<li>Not once did she attempt to downplay the severity of the crisis. Instead, <strong>she offered facts, educated herself on the data, and made tough choices that would ultimately allow New Zealand to handle the pandemic astutely and save many live</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Responsible leadership:</strong> The PM, along with her ministers took a pay cut of 20% for 6 months during the pandemic. In her own statement <strong>– “While it in itself won’t shift the government’s overall fiscal position, it is about leadership”.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Emotional intelligence</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>During the pandemic, Prime Minister <strong>Ardern showed her humane side and fostered the public’s trust by acknowledging the emotional aspect brought on by the crisis.</strong></li>
<li>She even went so far as to <strong>reassure children that the Easter Bunny was classified as a key worker and would be able to do their Easter rounds as always</strong>. While this may seem like a small gesture, the fact that she incorporated such an emotional response into her address <strong>showed her humanity and her relatability.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Effective Communication: The underrated value of listening and asking</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ardern used <strong>regular Facebook Live sessions to check in with citizens during</strong> their relatively brief time in lockdown.</li>
<li>In an incredibly informal, chatty manner, she effortlessly demonstrated consideration and empathy, whilst also delivering <strong>some tough messages, and providing clear direction to mobilize effort.</strong>  </li>
<li>To support citizens through lockdown, Ardern also conducted a <strong>series of video interviews in which she conversed with experts, including a psychologist about coping with the stresses of the pandemic</strong>, and an experienced business mentor about supporting small businesses.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Clear vision and humility</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Jacinda had earlier <strong>mentioned child poverty as the reason why she joined politics at the age of 17</strong>. She often visited refugee children as a part of working for an international youth organization.</li>
</ul>
<p>“If you ask me why I’m in politics, my answer would be simple — children. I genuinely believe our success as politicians should be based on the status of children. We need to change how we measure success and our indicators for action,” she had said in an <strong>ardent speech at the Social Good Summit 2018.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Trust</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Demonstrate credibility – for instance, by gaining the necessary knowledge and data and/or drawing upon relevant experience</li>
<li>Show reliability – be honest and do what you say you will do</li>
<li>Create intimacy – share some of yourself and be interested in others</li>
<li>Limit self-orientation – keep your self-interest in check</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Strength and solidarity are key</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In March 2019, Jacinda Ardern responded to a series of <strong>terrorist attacks on mosques in Christchurch with an approach that supported the people of New Zealand</strong> and quickly banned military-style assault weapons in the country. The leader <strong>refused to name the shooter in order to avoid giving him notoriety</strong> and assisted in uniting not only the people of Christchurch but New Zealand as a whole.</li>
<li>Ms Ardern <strong>wore a hijab and went to mourn with the grieving families</strong>. By keeping the focus on the victims rather than the perpetrator, she brought a healing touch to an otherwise tense, polarising moment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Inclusivity</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>She appointed <strong>Nanaia Mahuta, a Maori woman</strong>, in the high-profile <strong>portfolio of foreign ministers,</strong> while her party vowed that schools in the country would have the <strong>Māori language integrated into their curriculum by 2025.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In a world where politics is synonymous with realpolitik, <strong>she demonstrated that politics informed by a moral vision</strong> — doing the right thing rather than what best suits one’s interests <strong>— is not unthinkable.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Quote:</strong></p>
<p>At the heart of her leadership style:</p>
<p><strong><em>“Kindness, and not being afraid to be kind, or to focus on, or be really driven by empathy.</em></strong> <em>I think one of the sad things that I’ve seen in political leadership is – because we’ve placed so much emphasis on notions of assertiveness and strength over time – that we’ve probably assumed that it means you can’t have those other qualities of kindness and empathy. <strong>And yet, when you think about all the big challenges that we face in the world, that’s probably the quality we need the most</strong>.”</em></p>
<p>Jacinda Ardern</p>
<p><strong>InstaCurious:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Transformational leadership</strong> is defined as a leadership approach that causes a change in individuals and social systems. In its ideal form, it creates valuable and positive change in the followers with <strong>the end goal of developing followers into leaders.</strong> It refers to a leadership style that <strong>focuses on inspiring and motivating followers</strong> to not only achieve their goals but also to develop their own leadership potential.</p>

<p>As India’s Himalayan town of <strong>Joshimath</strong> has been sinking, <strong>Delhi’s Dwarka district</strong> reduced its reliance on groundwater and reversed the trend of land subsidence.</p>
<p><strong>A University of Cambridge</strong> report corroborated that the neighbourhood had subsided by around 3.5cm (1.4in) in 2014 alone. When groundwater is pumped out, the land above it sinks – and this leads to land subsidence.</p>
<p><strong>Initiatives taken:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Heavy fines</strong> were imposed on buildings still using borewells: By 2016, almost all housing societies had stopped using borewells</li>
<li><strong>Two local lakes</strong> (including a 200-year-old local reservoir named <strong>‘Naya Jhod’</strong>) were <strong>rejuvenated</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mandatory to irrigate public parks</strong> using only sewage and treated surface water</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Union Home Minister will take part in a celebration commemorating farmer leader Swami Sahajanand Saraswati’s birth anniversary in Patna, Bihar.</p>
<p><strong>Swami Sahajanand Saraswati:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>He (real name Navrang Rai) was an ascetic, a nationalist and a peasant leader of India.</li>
<li>Although born in present-day UP, his social and political activities <strong>focussed mostly on Bihar in the initial days</strong>, and gradually spread to the rest of India.</li>
<li><strong>The Bihar Provincial Kisan Sabha</strong> (BPKS) was founded by Saraswati in <strong>1929</strong> to address peasants’ complaints about zamindari attacks on their occupancy rights, and served as the foundation for the farmers’ movements in India.</li>
<li><strong>The All-India Kisan Sabha</strong> (AIKS) was established at the Lucknow session of the Indian National Congress in April <strong>1936</strong>, with <strong>Saraswati chosen as its first President.</strong></li>
<li>Subhash Chandra Bose and the All India Forward Bloc decided to observe April 28 as All-India Swami Sahajanand Day in protest of his arrest by the British Raj during the <strong>Quit India Movement.</strong></li>

<li>In the upcoming Budget, the Centre may increase the income support provided to farmers under the <strong>PM-KISAN scheme</strong> from Rs 6,000 to 8,000 rupees/year despite the budget’s primary focus on macroeconomic stability.</li>
<li>The proposal, in an effort <strong>to boost consumption and rural demand,</strong> would entail an annual additional cost of around Rs. 22,000 crores to the government.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The number of beneficiaries has <strong>crossed 110 million</strong> from 31 million at the beginning of the scheme and financial assistance of more than <strong>Rs 2 trillion has been provided to needy farmers</strong> in over 3 years<strong>.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The scheme addressed the liquidity constraints</strong> of farmers for buying agricultural inputs, daily consumption, education, health and other incidental expenses, especially during the Covid pandemic.</li>
