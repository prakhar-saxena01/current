<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/gujarats-harappan-necropolis-reveal-death-rituals-of-5000-years-ago/articleshow/96821787.cms"><strong>TOI</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Excavations at one of the <strong>biggest necropolises at Juna Khatiya village</strong> (Kutch, Gujarat) show rows of <strong>graves with valuable items</strong> such as Ceramic pots, beaded jewellery, animal bones etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>They date back to <strong>3200BCE to 2600BCE</strong> (predating several other Harappan sites)</li>
<li><strong>Dholavira</strong> ( a UNESCO world heritage site in Gujarat) has a cemetery in and around the town, but no major habitation has been discovered around Juan Khatiya.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is a necropolis?</strong></p>
<p>A necropolis is a <strong>large, designed cemetery with elaborate tomb monuments</strong>. The name stems from the Ancient Greek meaning “<strong>city of the dead</strong>“. The <strong>pyramid at Giza</strong>, in Egypt, is an example of a necropolis — it’s the tomb of an Egyptian pharaoh.</p>
<p><strong>Burial practices in the Indus Valley Civilization:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Three forms of burial were found at Mohenjodaro</strong>—<strong>complete, fractional and post-cremation</strong>.<ul>
<li><strong>Post‐cremation urn burials</strong>, predominant in the Mohenjodaro area</li>
<li><strong>Pot/urn burials</strong> are found at Kalibangan</li>
<li><strong>Sanauli</strong>– It is in the Baghpat district of UP and is known for the Archaeological remains of the Harappan cemetery.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Post-cremation (burial of bones or ashes)</strong> was the most <strong>common</strong> form of burial custom in the Indus Valley</li>
<li><strong>The head of the dead was normally laid towards the North</strong> and commonly used items were used as grave goods which were buried along with the dead.</li>
<li><strong>Other findings</strong><ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><strong>Brick chamber and Cists- Kalibagan</strong></li>
<li><strong>Wooden Coffin- Harappa</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pair of Skeletons- Lothal</strong></li>
<li><strong>Burial of man and dog- Ropar</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<p><strong>Significance of studying burial practices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A study of its burial rites, rituals and customs</strong> has revealed many details about life in this culture.</li>
<li><strong>They demonstrate that around the world- ancient afterlife items</strong> are buried along with the body in almost all the civilizations</li>
<li><strong>Gender difference: A higher number of votive pots</strong> (offering pots) <strong>in male graves</strong> indicates women were not considered equal to male citizens.</li>
<li><strong>Shows multiple classes:</strong> Ornaments were found on women of multiple social classes, including necklaces and bangles made of copper, shell, and gemstones.</li>
<li><strong>Connection with other civilizations</strong>: Archeologists currently presume the <strong>objects in votive pots</strong> were to serve the individuals in the afterlife. Some <strong>burial customs are similar</strong> to their contemporary Egyptian civilization.</li>
<li>Juan Khatiya demonstrate <strong>the transition from earth-mound burials to stone graves</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>pottery</strong> has features and style similar to those excavated from <strong>early Harappan sites in Sindh and Balochistan (Pakistan)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Indus Valley Civilization:</strong></p>
<p>The cultures of the Indus Valley Civilization (Harappan Civilization), are thought to range in existence anywhere from <strong>5500 BCE to 1700 BCE</strong>. This civilization reached its peak maturity from 2600 BCE to 1600 BCE.</p>

<p><strong>Syllabus: Indian Judiciary</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/vp-jagdeep-dhankar-basic-structure-indian-constitution-explained-8377438/#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20basic%20structure%20doctrine%3F,Bharati%20v%20State%20of%20Kerala.">Indian Express</a><strong>,</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/who-was-kesvananda-bharati-and-how-is-he-associated-with-the-basic-structure-doctrine-8378771/">Indian Express</a></p>
<p>Context: Vice President Jagdeep Dhankar criticised the Supreme Court for using the Basic Structure Doctrine to strike down constitutional amendments by Parliament, such as the NJAC Act.</p>
<ul>
<li>Previously, the VP had called the striking down of the NJAC Act a “<strong>severe compromise” of parliamentary sovereignty</strong> and disregard of the “mandate of the people”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the basic structure doctrine?</strong></p>
<p>The Doctrine of Basic Structure is a form of <strong>judicial review</strong> that is used to test the legality of any legislation by the courts.</p>
<ul>
<li>The doctrine was evolved by the Supreme Court in the <strong>1973 landmark ruling in Kesavananda Bharati v State of Kerala. In a 7-6 verdict, a 13-judge Constitution Bench</strong> ruled that the ‘basic structure’ of the Constitution is <strong>inviolable</strong>, and could not be <strong>amended</strong> by Parliament.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Basic Structure Doctrine (BSD) test:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If a law is found to <strong>“damage or destroy” the “basic features of the Constitution”,</strong> the Court declares it <strong>unconstitutional</strong>.</li>
<li>The test is applied to <strong>constitutional amendments</strong> to ensure the amendment does not dilute the fundamentals of the Constitutional itself.</li>
<li>The test is widely regarded as a <strong>check on majoritarian impulses of the Parliament</strong> since it places substantive limits on the power to amend the Constitution.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Origin:</strong></p>
<p>The origins of the basic structure doctrine are found in the <strong>post-war German Constitution law</strong> which, after the Nazi regime, was amended to protect some basic laws.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p><strong>After a reversal of key legislation including land reforms</strong>; nationalization of banks; abolition of the privy purse- the Parliament brought in a constitutional amendment to give itself the power to amend any part of the Constitution and passed a law that it cannot be reviewed by the courts.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Court had to <strong>then examine the scope of the Parliament’s power</strong> to amend the Constitution and the legality of the land reforms.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><img alt="" src="https://staging.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/four_cases.png?is-pending-load=1" /></strong> </p>
<p><strong>What are the basic features of the Indian Constitution?</strong></p>
<p>The content of the doctrine is derived from the several judgements of the court e.g. judicial review, rule of law, federalism, and democratic republic structure are identified as basic features.</p>
<p><strong>Significance of Basic Structure:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is a <strong>testimony to the theory of Constitutionalism</strong>to prevent the damage to the essence of COI by the brute majority of the ruling majority.</li>
<li>It saved the Indian democracy <strong>as it acts as a limitation of constituent power</strong> or else unlimited power of parliament might have turned India into a totalitarian regime.</li>
<li><strong>It helps us to retain the basic tenets of our constitution</strong>so meticulously framed by the founding fathers of our Constitution.</li>
<li><strong>It strengthens our democracy by delineating a true separation of power</strong>where the Judiciary is independent of the other two organs.</li>
<li><strong>Being dynamic in nature</strong>, it is <strong>more progressive</strong> and <strong>open</strong> to <strong>changes</strong> in time, unlike the rigid nature of earlier judgements.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why is the doctrine criticised?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It is not found in the text of the original Constitution</strong> itself and therefore by inventing this test the judiciary is encroaching on the Parliament’s powers.</li>
<li><strong>Senior advocate Raju Ramachandran</strong>: The power of “unelected judges” to strike down amendments to the Constitution on the basis of this doctrine is “anti-democratic and counter-majoritarian.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>However, the doctrine rests on a <strong>sound structural interpretation</strong> of the Constitution. Many of the critics of the basic structure such as Justice YV Chandrachud, former Chief Justice of India found himself in the minority in the Kesavananda Bharati ruling. However, in subsequent rulings where the Court applied the test, Justice Chandrachud applied the doctrine to limit Parliament’s powers.</p>
<p><strong>Related Concept:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Who was Kesavanand Bharati?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kesavananda Bharati (9 December 1940 – 6 September 2020)</strong> was a Hindu monk who served as the Shankaracharya (head) of <strong>Edneer Mutt, a Hindu monastery in Kasaragod district</strong>, Kerala, India from 1961 until his death.</p>
<p>The case in which Bharati had challenged a Kerala Land Reform Act nearly four decades ago set the principle that the Supreme Court is the guardian of the basic structure of the constitution</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://staging.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/quint.jpg?is-pending-load=1" /></p>
<p><strong>Parliamentary sovereignty</strong> is a concept which holds that the legislative body has absolute sovereignty and is supreme over all other government institutions, including executive or judicial bodies. In which the sovereign legislature may change or repeal any previous legislation and is not bound by any written law like a constitution.</p>
<p><strong>In a democracy, parliamentary sovereignty can’t be inviolable. Because</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It depends upon the nature of the constitution either the constitution has absolutely given the freedom to parliament or it has restricted the absolute power of parliament through any provisions.</li>
<li>The sovereign power of the parliament will be dependent upon the checks and balance mechanism provided by the constitution.</li>

<p><strong>Direction:</strong> The article discusses the need to frame new guidelines for the Preliminary Assessment of children (between 16-18) in conflict with the law as adults under the JJ Act.</p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The NCPCR has come up with draft guidelines on the <strong>preliminary assessment of whether certain minors are to be tried under law</strong> as <strong>adults</strong> in particular cases, under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Previously, all children under the age of 18 were deemed minors by the law, but <strong>a provision was added to the JJ Act in 2015 that allows a child in conflict with the law to be tried as an adult.</strong></li>
<li>In cases of <strong>heinous offences</strong>, a child between the ages of 16 and 18 may be tried as an adult, and the <strong>Juvenile Justice Board</strong> (JJB) must perform a preliminary assessment to determine whether to try such a child as an adult or a minor.</li>
<li>If tried as an adult, the child may be sentenced to jail, with the <strong>exception of death or life imprisonment</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Need for the NCPCR’s draft guidelines:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Recently, the SC held that the task of preliminary assessment under the JJ Act is a “<strong>delicate task</strong>” and the assessment requires expertise and direction to put in place specific guidelines.</li>
<li>The NCPCR has framed guidelines which describe the <strong>key procedures to conduct the preliminary assessment.</strong></li>
<li>While the course of assessment may differ from child to child, <strong>the guidelines are meant to frame essential components and the basic mechanisms to address any ambiguity.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The draft guidelines:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The preliminary assessment has to determine <strong>four aspects:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>The physical capacity</strong> of the child</li>
<li><strong>Mental capacity</strong></li>
<li><strong>Circumstances</strong> in which the offence was allegedly committed</li>
<li><strong>Ability to understand the consequences</strong> of the alleged offence</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It also states that the <strong>experts (</strong>from the field of child psychology and psychiatry<strong>) must be given an optimal opportunity</strong> to interact with the child to build a rapport.</li>
<li>A copy of the assessment (<strong>conducted within 3 months</strong> of the child being produced before the JJB) must be given to the child and a legal aid counsel must be present during the assessment.</li>
<li><strong>The JJB must rely on the Social Investigation Report,</strong> statements of witnesses and interaction with parents, guardians, school staff, peer groups and neighbours.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR):</strong></p>
<p>●        It is an Indian <strong>statutory</strong> body established by an Act of Parliament – the Commission for Protection of Child Rights (CPCR) Act, 2005.</p>
<p>●        The Commission works under the aegis of the <strong>Union Ministry of Women and Child Development</strong> and became operational in 2007.</p>
<p>●        It is mandated to ensure that all Laws, Policies, Programmes, and Administrative Mechanisms align with the Child Rights perspective as enshrined in the Indian Constitution and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>
<p>●        As defined by the commission, a child includes a person <strong>up to the age of 18 years.</strong></p>
<p><strong>JJ Act, 2015:</strong></p>
<p>●        The Ministry of Women and Child Development introduced the Act to replace the Juvenile Delinquency Law and the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act of 2000.</p>
<p>●        One of the main provisions of the Act is that minors in conflict with the law between the ages of <strong>16 and 18 can be tried as adults.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: World Economic Forum (WEF) has released Global Risk Report 2023</p>
<p><strong>Key findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Major global risks (see below image)</strong><ul>
<li><strong>In the next 2 years:</strong> Cost of living; Natural disasters and extreme weather events; Geoeconomic confrontation</li>
<li><strong>In the next 10 years:</strong> Failure to mitigate climate change; Biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Major risks to India</strong>: Digital inequality; geopolitical confrontation for resources, the rising cost of living, debt crisis, natural disasters and extreme weather events</li>
<li><strong>Technologies such as AI, Quantum and Biotechnology</strong> are going to exacerbate the inequalities and digital divide ( if no action is taken to mitigate it)</li>
<li><strong>Economic and geopolitical risks:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Covid-19 and Ukraine war has resulted in rising inflation</strong>, rapid normalization of monetary policies, low-growth and low-investment era</li>
<li><strong>A miscalibration between monetary and fiscal policies</strong> will raise the likelihood of liquidity shocks, signalling a more prolonged economic downturn and debt distress on a global scale.</li>
<li><strong>Geopolitical fragmentation will drive geoeconomic warfare</strong> and heighten the risk of multi-domain conflicts<ul>
<li><strong>g. data regarding Russia’s boreal forests</strong> –the biggest land-based carbon store on the planet – is <strong>no longer available for international scientific research</strong> because of the war in Ukraine.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Concurrent shocks, deeply interconnected risks and eroding resilience</strong> are giving rise to the risk of <strong>polycrises</strong> ( one crisis leading to another and the overall impact far exceeds the sum of each part)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Food, fuel and cost crises exacerbate societal vulnerability</strong> while declining investments in human development erode future resilience</li>
<li><strong>As volatility in multiple domains</strong> grows in parallel, the risk of polycrises accelerates</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="self-healing-concrete"><strong>Self-healing concrete</strong></h3>
<p>New research from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University, and laboratories in Italy and Switzerland have found that Romans used a <strong>‘hot-mixing’ method of concrete</strong> to create their durable structures.</p>
<p><strong>Significance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Knowledge about ancient techniques</strong>: The unexpected ancient manufacturing strategy might hold the key to the architectural creations of the Romans.</li>
<li><strong>Unique properties</strong>: The method gave the <strong>concrete self-healing properties</strong> so that cracks would fill before they could spread</li>
<li>It can also help <strong>reduce the environmental impact of cement production</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How did Romans make durable concrete?</strong></p>
<p>Romans employed a hot mixing method and <strong>used quicklime</strong> in conjunction with, or instead of, slaked lime for producing concrete. Hot mixing was the key to the super-durable nature.</p>

<p>Romans</p>
<p><strong>About Romans:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Roman civilization</strong> refers to the period from the founding of the Italian city of Rome in the <strong>8th century BC</strong> to the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the <strong>5th century AD</strong>.</p>
<p>The ancient Romans were <strong>masters of engineering, constructing vast networks of roads, aqueducts, ports and massive buildings</strong>, whose remains have survived for two millennia</p>
<p>Many of these structures were built with concrete: <strong>Rome’s famed Pantheon</strong>, which has the <strong>world’s largest unreinforced concrete dome</strong> and was dedicated in 128 CE, is still intact.</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: The Office of the Registrar-General of India (RGI) is following the set of criteria set out by the Lokur Committee <strong>nearly 60 years ago</strong> to define any new community as a Scheduled Tribe</p>
<p><strong>The criteria of the Lokur Committee for recognition of any community under the ST list are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Indications of primitive traits</li>
<li>Distinctive culture</li>
<li>Geographical isolation</li>
<li>The shyness of contact with the community at large</li>
<li>Backwardness</li>
</ul>
<p>However, over the years, the criteria have come under severe criticism.</p>
<p>Previously Central government has called these criteria <strong>“obsolete”, “condescending”, “dogmatic”, and “rigid”</strong> and it was considering a proposal to change the criteria for scheduling new communities as STs.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Office of the RGI’s nod is mandatory</strong> for the <strong>inclusion of any community in ST lists</strong>, as per the procedure for scheduling tribes.</li>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: India has sought restoration of the preferential access to the US market that was revoked by Washington in 2019.</p>
<p><strong>About GSP status:</strong></p>
<p>GSP is <strong>the largest and oldest U.S. trade preference program</strong>. Established by the <strong>Trade Act of 1974</strong>, GSP promotes economic development by eliminating duties on thousands of products when imported from one of 119 designated beneficiary countries and territories.</p>
<p><strong>Origin of GSP</strong></p>
<p>It was 1st instituted by the UNCTAD conference in 1971</p>
<p><strong>Why US terminated India’s GSP status?</strong></p>
<p>President Donald Trump has terminated India’s designation as a beneficiary developing nation under the key GSP trade programme due to <strong>India’s failure to provide the United States with assurances that it will provide equitable and reasonable access to its markets</strong> in numerous sectors</p>
<p><strong>How has the termination of GSP impacted India?</strong></p>
<p>India was the <strong>largest beneficiary of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) status</strong> in 2017, with <strong>$5.7 billion</strong> worth of imports into the US given duty-free status. About 2,000 products including auto parts and textile materials were allowed to enter the US duty-free.</p>
<p><strong>Current Indo-US trade:</strong></p>
<p>Bilateral trade between <strong>India and the US rose to $119.5 billion in 2021-22 from $80.5 billion</strong> in 2020-21</p>

<p>Context:  A new study shows evidence of <strong>what could be an active mantle plume beneath the surface of the red planet</strong></p>
<p><strong>About new findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>According to the evidence, the mantle plume is <strong>situated underneath a low-lying area called Elysium Planitia that lies north of the equator</strong>. Though an otherwise indistinctive area, scientists found unexpected evidence of geological activities in Elysium in the recent past.</li>
<li>Studying the data from <strong>NASA’s InSight lander</strong>, scientists found that the <strong>volcanic eruptions at Elysium Planitia originate from a set of fissures called Cerberus Fossae</strong> that stretch for more than 1278 kilometres (800 miles) across the planet’s surface.</li>
<li>They also found that most marsquakes emanate from this region.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Mantle Plumes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mantle plumes are <strong>large blobs of molten rock that rise towards the surface from the interiors of a planet.</strong> They push through the intermediate or mantle layers and accumulate at the base of the crust.</li>
<li>This geological phenomenon can be witnessed on <strong>Earth in Hawaii where the warm materials from the plume ooze out of fissures to create great volcanic plains.</strong></li>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: A recently developed <strong>surgical knife capable of identifying tumours can detect endometrial cancer within seconds</strong>, allowing people with healthy uteruses to get the ‘all-clear’ faster.</p>
<p>According to the World Cancer Research Fund International, womb or endometrial cancer is <strong>the 6th most commonly occurring cancer among people with uteruses.</strong></p>
<p><strong>About iKnife:</strong></p>
<p>The researchers found that a surgical tool <strong>called iKnife could accurately detect the presence of endometrial cancer.</strong> The <strong>iKnife is already being used to spot breast and brain cancer</strong></p>
<p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
<p>The knife uses <strong>electric currents on biopsy tissue</strong> and then analyses the vapourised aerosols from the tissue in a mass spectrometer to give real-time information about activity in the tissue.</p>
<p>The study noted that the <strong>iKnife reliably diagnosed endometrial cancer in tissue within seconds with an accuracy of 89%.</strong> This would greatly minimise the delays faced by patients who wait for a normal histopathological diagnosis.</p>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/using-artificial-photosynthesis-to-make-green-hydrogen-at-record-efficiency/article66367945.ece">The Hindu</a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> A study published has reported a way to <strong>achieve relatively high efficiency in an artificial photosynthesis reaction</strong> in which water is <strong>split into oxygen and hydrogen using sunlight and a catalyst.</strong> The technique is called <strong>photocatalysis.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The current method to make green hydrogen:</strong></p>
<p>The conventional way to produce green hydrogen is electrolysis, where water is split into its constituent elements by passing a large current through it<strong>. If both the electrolyser and the source of electricity are green, the resulting hydrogen is also green.</strong></p>
<p>Currently, most of the <strong>hydrogen in India is produced by steam-reforming</strong>: methane is mixed with water in a reactor at 800-900º C and 20-30 atmospheres of pressure to yield hydrogen and carbon monoxide. <strong>The resulting hydrogen is thus ‘grey’.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Photocatalysis:</strong></p>
<p>Photocatalytic STH is inspired by <strong>photosynthesis</strong>, where leaves use energy from incident sunlight to split water into oxygen and hydrogen. Here, “the process consists of a <strong>semiconductor photocatalyst wafer immersed in freshwater or seawate</strong>r.</p>
<p>When <strong>photons in sunlight strike the wafer, they dislodge electrons in its atoms</strong>, which trigger a redox reaction in the <strong>water and separate hydrogen and oxygen</strong>. The energy source is sunlight and the feedstock is water – <strong>both abundant on Earth and green by nature.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Efficiency:</strong></p>
<p>In a 10-hour test, the group recorded an <strong>efficiency of 7.4% with tap water and 6.6% with seawater,</strong> probably “the result of ions or other impurities present” in the liquids, according to the paper. <strong>The 9.2% record required deionised water. The STH efficiency was 3% in a 140-hour test.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: Scientists have found the <strong>remains of four species of dinosaurs, including a megaraptor</strong>, in an inhospitable valley in <strong>Chilean Patagonia that has emerged over the past decade as an important fossil deposit.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Findings:</strong></p>
<p>They also <strong>identified two specimens of Unenlagiinae</strong>, closely related to <strong>velociraptors and which have a “novel evolutionary character,</strong> which would indicate that this is a new species of unenlagine or perhaps a representative of a different clade (group).</p>
