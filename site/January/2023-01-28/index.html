<h4 id="gs-paper-1"><strong>GS Paper 1</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Indian Culture/Post-Independence consolidation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/india-republic-day-military-parade-significance-8405248/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Direction:</strong> The article highlights the strategic significance of the Republic Day parade in New Delhi.</p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> As India celebrated her 74th Republic Day on 26th January 2023, the parade in New Delhi remains the Day’s most enduring symbol for Indians. It was a grand show of India’s military might and showcased its diverse culture as well.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1st parade, 1950: Held in the present day ‘Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium’.</li>
<li>The ceremony: included the <strong>official swearing-in of India’s first President</strong> (Dr Rajendra Prasad), a marching contingent of over 3000 men, Liberator planes of the Indian Air Force flying overhead, etc.</li>
<li>1955 onwards: The parade shifted to Rajpath (now Kartavya Path).</li>
<li><strong>The parade</strong> from the former Viceroy’s residence (Rashtrapati Bhawan now) to the memorial for British Indian soldiers (India Gate now) also <strong>underwent an Indianization process.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What’s on the display at the 74th Republic Day parade in New Delhi?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>After two years of celebrations without any chief guest due to the COVID-19 pandemic, <strong>Egyptian President</strong> Abdel Fattah El-Sisi was the chief guest at this year’s parade.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The drive for <strong>atma nirbharta or self-sufficiency</strong> in India’s military might and the <strong>key role of women</strong> in the armed forces <strong>(Nari Shakti)</strong> was under the spotlight. <strong>For example,</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Indian Army showcased the Made-in-India main battle tank <strong>Arjun, the NAG missile system, the K-9 Vajra-T gun system, the AKASH air defence system, and the Brahmos missile. Also, this was the 1st time that no Russian weapons were on display.</strong></li>
<li><strong>In a display of women’s empowerment</strong>, the marching contingents of the Indian Air Force and the Indian Navy were led by women officers for the first time.</li>
<li><strong>Assam Rifles</strong> — India’s oldest paramilitary force, highlighted the message of gender equality: The 144-strong contingent participated in an equal number of Riflemen and Riflewomen in the parade. “The mixed marching contingent of men and women of Assam Rifles marching shoulder to shoulder is the <strong>epitome of the ethos of the force of equal opportunity to all</strong>.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Navy’s contingent also included <strong>three women and six men Agniveers</strong>, from the Agnipath scheme.</li>
<li><strong>The theme of nari shakti or female power</strong> carried beyond the armed forces contingents into the parade’s cultural tableaux as well. <strong>For example,</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Tripura’s tableau focuses on women’s role</strong> in creating sustainable livelihoods through tourism and organic farming.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance of the Republic Day military parade:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Display of power:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There is a historical link between strong displays of soldiers and weaponry, <strong>national pride and projection of power to the nationals and the world</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>The Prussian army</strong> (Germany) – pioneered modern military parades.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Symbol of victory against colonial rule:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>During the British Raj, royal parades projected British power <strong>to its competing European colonial powers</strong>.</li>
<li>Upon independence, the military parade was chosen as an integral part of Republic Day celebrations to mark the day as –<ul>
<li><strong>India’s new constitution</strong> officially coming into effect</li>
<li><strong>A day of victory</strong> (against colonial rule) for the Indian state and its people and the coming of a <strong>new, sovereign and strong republic</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance of the non-military elements in the Republic Day parade:</strong></p>
<p><strong>A symbol of unity in diversity:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Republic Day parade includes non-military elements like the <strong>iconic tableaux</strong>.</li>
<li>The tableaux are a way to <strong>celebrate India’s diversity</strong>: and express regional identities while promoting a sense of national identity.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="gs-paper-1_1"><strong>GS Paper 1</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus: Economic Geography</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/ongc-to-map-india-s-geothermal-resources-in-search-of-clean-energy-11674581979314.html"><strong>Live Mint</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> ONGC plans to <strong>map the geothermal energy sources of India</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The focus on geothermal energy comes at a time when the country has set an ambitious <strong>climate target of 500 GW of installed renewable energy capacity and net zero carbon emission by 2070</strong>.</li>
<li>ONGC also has accelerated its <strong>diversification efforts through its ‘Energy Strategy 2040’</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Geothermal Energy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Geothermal energy is an energy source that is <strong>stored in the form of heat beneath the earth’s surface, which is clean, renewable, sustainable, carbon-free, continuous, uninterrupted, and environment-friendly.</strong></li>
<li>It is the only renewable energy <strong>available 24×7 to mankind not requiring storage and unaffected</strong> by day-night or seasonality variance.</li>
<li>Geothermal resources in India have been <strong>mapped by the Geological Survey of India (GSI) and a broad estimate by</strong> the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) <strong>suggests that there could be 10 GW of geothermal power</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/how_dose_.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/how_dose_.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Types of Geothermal Power Plants ( Sometimes such Qns can be asked in Prelims)</strong></p>
<p>There are <strong>three types of geothermal power plants</strong> where we can harness the heat of the earth to produce electricity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dry steam powerplant</li>
<li>Flash steam power plant</li>
<li>Binary cycle power plant</li>
</ul>
<p>All these plants follow the <strong>same principle of using the heat of the earth to produce electricity</strong>. As flash steam power plant requires a high enthalpy range and hence they cannot be used in India.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of Geothermal Energy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>renewable,</li>
<li>provides a continuous, uninterrupted supply</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>High initial capital requirement.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Location-specific</strong> energy source, associated with other emissions like <strong>sulphur dioxide and hydrogen sulphide</strong>.</li>
<li>May cause disasters – <strong>earthquakes</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Status of Geothermal Energy/Geothermal Powerplants in India</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has established India’s first Geothermal field development project at <strong>Puga village in Ladakh</strong>.</li>
<li>Tata Power is India’s largest integrated power company. <strong>Tata Power will be setting up a geothermal plant in Gujarat of about 5MW plant.</strong></li>
<li><strong>National Thermal Power Corporation</strong> is planning to construct a 300MW of geothermal power plant project in Chhattisgarh.</li>

<p><strong>Direction:</strong> The article highlights the objectives, achievements and shortcomings of the Green India Mission.</p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> According to data accessed via the RTI, India is lagging behind in the targets to increase the number and quality of tree and forest-cover plantations set in the <strong>Green India Mission</strong> (GIM).</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As per the <strong>India State of Forest Report-2021</strong>, forest and tree cover in the country increased by <strong>2,261 square kilometres</strong> since the last assessment in 2019.</li>
<li>India’s total forest and tree cover was <strong>80.</strong><strong>9 million hectares</strong>, which accounted for <strong>24.62%</strong> of the geographical area of the country.</li>
<li>According to India’s National Forest Policy (1988), <strong>at least 33%</strong> of the country’s total land area should be covered by forests in order to ensure ecological stability.</li>
<li>India is tenth in the world in terms of the total area covered by forests, <strong>but only 120th in terms of the proportion</strong> of that area covered by forests.</li>
<li><strong>17 States and Union Territories</strong> had more than 33% of their area under forest cover.</li>
<li>The top five States in terms of forest cover as a percentage of their total geographical area were <strong>Mizoram</strong> (84.53%), Arunachal Pradesh (79.33%), Meghalaya (76%), etc.</li>
<li><strong>MP had the largest forest cover</strong>, followed by Arunachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and Maharashtra.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>National Mission for a Green India/ GIM:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/nation.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/nation-1024x815.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>It is <strong>one of the eight Missions</strong> under the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) launched in <strong>2014</strong> for a 10 years period with an outlay of Rs 60,000 crore.</li>
<li>It aims at <strong>protecting, restoring and enhancing</strong> India’s forest cover and responding to climate change.</li>
<li><strong>The target under the Mission is –</strong><ul>
<li>Increasing the forest and tree cover by <strong>5 million hectares (ha) in 10 years</strong>.</li>
<li>Increasing the quality of the existing forest and tree cover in <strong>another 5 million ha</strong> of forest in non-forest lands in 10 years.</li>
<li>Increasing <strong>forest-based livelihood income</strong> for about 3 million households in and around these forest areas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is implemented under the overall administrative control of the <strong>MoEF&amp;CC</strong> and presents <strong>a holistic approach</strong> to greening that considers –<ul>
<li>Carbon sequestration goals</li>
<li>Maintain diverse ecosystem services (biodiversity, etc) and provisioning services (fuel, fodder, etc)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Integrated cross-sectoral approach:</strong> Implemented on both public and private lands, with local communities playing a crucial part in planning, decision-making, implementation, and monitoring.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Targets under the GIM:</strong> From 2015-16 to 2021-22, the Centre had approved a target of increasing tree/forest cover by 53,377 hectares and improving the quality of the degraded forest by 1,66,656 ha.</p>
<p><strong>What are the challenges?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The GIM is able to achieve only 8% of its plantation target. For example</strong>, tree/forest cover had increased by 26,287 hectares and forest quality improved by only 1,02,096 hectares as of December 31, 2022.</li>
<li><strong>The GIM is grossly underfunded and funds allocated remain underutilised: t</strong>he Centre had allocated <strong>₹681 crores but only ₹525 crores</strong> had been utilised.</li>
<li><strong>Afforestation</strong> was solely for the purpose of boosting tree count, rather than taking into account soil and weather conditions.</li>
<li><strong>C</strong><strong>ommercial plantations</strong> (like eucalyptus) to enhance green cover, which couldn’t make up for natural forests and was vulnerable to <strong>insect infestations because they were monocultures.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>InstaCurious:</strong></p>
<p>In its new Nationally Determined Contribution, India pledged to reduce the emissions intensity of its gross domestic product by 45% by 2030, and to get 50% of its electricity from non-fossil fuel-based sources by 2030.</p>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/explained-japans-decision-to-flush-fukushima-wastewater-into-the-ocean/article66432630.ece"><strong>The Hindu</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: Japan is expected to <strong>start flushing 1.25 million tonnes of wastewater from the embattled Fukushima nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean</strong> this year, as part of its project to decommission the facility.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/fuku.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/fuku.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>About Nuclear Power:</strong></p>
<p>Nuclear power is electricity generated by <strong>power plants that derive their heat from fission in a nuclear reactor.</strong> Except for the reactor, which plays the role of a boiler in a fossil-fuel power plant, a nuclear power plant is <strong>similar to a large coal-fired power plant, with pumps, valves, steam generators, turbines, electric generators, condensers, and associated equipment.</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/nuclear.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/nuclear.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>What was the issue:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In March 2011, after a magnitude 9 earthquake, a <strong>tsunami flooded the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Okuma and damaged its diesel generators</strong>. The loss of power suspended the coolant supply to reactors at the facility; the tsunami <strong>also disabled backup systems.</strong></li>
<li>The water that the Japanese government wants to flush from the plant was <strong>used to cool the reactors, plus rainwater and groundwater</strong>. It contains radioactive isotopes from the damaged reactors and is thus itself radioactive.</li>
<li><strong>Japan has said that it will release this water into the Pacific Ocean over the next 30 years.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Treated Water:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO),</strong> which operates the Fukushima facility, <strong>has treated the water to remove most radioactive isotopes.</strong></li>
<li>Japanese government required the water to <strong>have 1/40th as much tritium as the permitted limit</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Issues with discharging treated water into the Pacific Ocean:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Difficult to <strong>remove tritium from the water</strong>.</li>
<li>Tritium is easily <strong>absorbed by the bodies of living creatures and rapidly distributed via blood</strong>.</li>
<li>Other radionuclides include isotopes of <strong>ruthenium and plutonium</strong>, which could persist for longer in the bodies of marine creatures and on the seafloor and could not be completely removed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other options available with Japan:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Store the water for longer and then discharge it</strong> – This is because tritium’s half-life – the time it takes for its quantity to be halved through radioactive decay – <strong>is 12-13 years</strong>. The quantity of any other radioactive isotopes present in the water will also decrease at this time (each isotope has its own half-life). So at <strong>the time of discharge, the water could be less radioactive</strong>.</li>

<p><strong>Direction:</strong> This is an interview article with Sri Lankan High Commissioner to India Milinda Moragoda. We will concentrate on only prelims-related news.</p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Recently IMF has confirmed receiving India’s written financing assurance in support of Sri Lanka’s economic revival.</p>
<p><strong>The economic crisis in Sri Lanka:</strong></p>
<p>Sri Lanka is grappling with a shortage of foreign currency, higher inflation and a steep recession – the worst such crisis since its independence from Britain in 1948.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>India, China and Japan</strong> are Sri Lanka’s three largest bilateral creditors</li>
<li><strong>Sri Lanka</strong> has an overall debt of around <strong>52bn US dollars</strong> (nearly <strong>40% is owed to private creditors</strong>, of the rest <strong>60% is owned to bilateral partners</strong>: China owns 52%, Japan (19%) and India (12%))</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The recovery plan:</strong></p>
<p>Previously experts in Sri Lanka had asked lenders (creditors) to take a ‘<strong>Haircut’</strong> on their lending. However, as per the new plan, <strong>none of the official lenders</strong> would take a <strong>haircut</strong> <strong>while giving Sri Lanka time to recover</strong> with an IMF programme. But <strong>private creditors</strong>, who hold the largest chunk of Sri Lanka’s foreign debt, may have to take a haircut.</p>
<p><strong>What is a Haircut?</strong></p>
<p>When a bank or creditor country takes a ‘haircut’, it means <strong>it accepts less than what was due in a particular loan account</strong>. For example: if a bank was owed Rs 10,000 cr by a borrower and it agrees to take back only Rs 8,000 cr, it takes a 20% haircut.</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: Hindenburg Research, which has accused the Adani Group of fraud, is a short seller.</p>
<p><strong>What is Short-Selling?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Short selling, or shorting, is</strong> a trading strategy based on the expectation that the <strong>price of the security will fall.</strong> While fundamentally it is based on the “<strong>buy low, sell high” approach</strong>, the sequence of transactions is reversed in short selling — to <strong>sell high first and buy low later</strong>. Also, in short selling, the trader usually does not own the securities he sells, but merely borrows them.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Traders in the US use short selling as speculation</strong>, and investors or portfolio managers could use it as a hedge against the downside risk of a particular stock.</li>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: After China, India (on SEBI’s recommendation) will become the second country in the world to start the <strong>‘trade-plus-one’ (T+1) settlement cycle</strong> in top-listed securities.</p>
<p><strong>What is the T+1 settlement cycle?</strong></p>
<p>In simple terms, T+1 settlement means that securities transactions will reflect in the demat account after a day instead of two days now under the T+2 cycle. If an investor buys a stock on Thursday, it would be shown in the demat account on Friday.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of the move:</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>Brings operational efficiency</li>
<li>Faster fund remittances</li>
<li>Share delivery</li>
<li>Ease for stock market participants</li>
<li>Reduces risks and frees up capital required to collateralise the risk</li>
<li>Reduces the number of outstanding unsettled trades at any point in time</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why are foreign investors opposed?</strong></p>
<p>Foreign investors operate from <strong>different geographies leading to time zone differences, information flow processes,</strong> and foreign exchange problems. Foreign investors said they would also find it difficult to hedge their net India exposure in dollar terms at the end of the day under the T+1 system.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The United States, United Kingdom and Eurozone markets</strong> are yet to move to the T+1 system.</li>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: The government ceremonially inaugurated the <strong>demo run of an Inland Water Vessel</strong> powered by Methanol blended Diesel (MD15) (15% methanol blended HSD)</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of blending gasoline with Methanol:</strong></p>
<p>Blending 15% methanol in gasoline can result in <strong>at least a 15% reduction</strong> in the import of gasoline/crude oil. In addition, this would <strong>bring down GHG emissions by 20%</strong> in terms of particulate matter, NOx, and SOx, thereby improving urban air quality. It will also create nearly 5 million new jobs in the Methanol economy.</p>
<p><strong>About Methanol Economy:</strong></p>
<p>NITI Aayog’s ‘Methanol Economy’ programme (launched in 2018) is aimed at reducing India’s oil import bill, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and <strong>converting coal reserves and municipal solid waste into methanol.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>About Methanol:</strong></p>
<p>Methanol is a <strong>cost-effective alternative marine fuel</strong>. It is less costly than other marine fuels and is economical in terms of developing the shoreside storage and bunkering infrastructure. It is also known as wood alcohol. Its properties are similar to ethanol. It is also used in products such as plastics, paints, and cosmetics.</p>

<p>Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) last year (November 2022) granted an <strong>in-principal clearance</strong> for the diversion of <strong>130 sq km of forest</strong> in Great Nicobar Island for the mega project.</p>
<ul>
<li>The project includes a <strong>transhipment port, an airport, a power plant</strong> and a greenfield township.</li>
<li>Implemented by <strong>Andaman and Nicobar Islands Integrated Development Corporation</strong> under a vision plan conceived by the NITI Aayog.</li>
<li>It includes <strong>compensatory afforestation</strong> on <strong>“non-notified forest land” in Haryana</strong>.</li>
</ul>
