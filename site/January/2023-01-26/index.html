<p><strong>Context</strong>: A <strong>CJI -led bench</strong> has decided to examine a <strong>petition challenging mandatory minimum sentencing in the case of gang rape of a minor below the age of 12.</strong></p>
<p><strong>About Mandatory minimum sentences:</strong></p>
<p>As per the 2016 ruling in ‘<strong>Mohd Hashim vs State Of UP And Others’.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The concept of mandatory minimum sentencing refers to “<strong>a sentence which must be imposed without leaving any discretion to the court. It means a quantum of punishment that cannot be reduced below the period fixed,</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A concept that comes primarily from the Canadian and American legal systems; in India, such sentences are prescribed for <strong>all sexual offenses under the Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act except the offense of sexual harassment.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What are the arguments for and against?</strong></p>
<p><strong>For:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It <strong>limits the scope for judicial discretion and arbitrariness, thereby enhancing the cause of justice.</strong> </li>
<li>It acts as a deterrent for serious or harsh offenses by ensuring that the perpetrator doesn’t go unpunished.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Against:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This leads to <strong>overcrowding of prisons and is unfair as the convict’s mitigating circumstances</strong>, such as if they are a first-time offender or the sole breadwinner in the family, are often overlooked.</li>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/passive-euthanasia-india-laws-supreme-court-changes-in-living-will-guidelines-8404919/#:~:text=Passive%20euthanasia%20was%20legalised%20in,medical%20decisions%20in%20the%20future."><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Direction:</strong> The article discusses the issue of living will – meaning, evolution, and guidelines to implement it.</p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> A five-judge SC bench decided to modify the existing rules for “living wills” as established in its 2018 decision allowing passive euthanasia, in order to make the process of passive euthanasia easier.</p>
<p><strong>Meaning of ‘Living Will’:</strong> Living will is <strong>a person’s right to make an advance directive</strong> about the course of his or her treatment, including the removal of life support, if such a situation arises.</p>
<p><strong>Evolution of the concept of ‘Living Will’ in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Law Commission of India</strong> (2006) in its 196th Report titled <strong>‘Medical Treatment to Terminally Ill Patients (Protection of Patients and Medical Practitioners)’</strong>: A patient’s decision to not receive medical treatment did not constitute an attempt to commit suicide <strong>under Section 309 IPC</strong>. Also, a doctor who obeys the instructions of a competent patient to withhold/withdraw medical treatment <strong>does not commit a breach of professional duty</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Aruna Shanbaug</strong> case (2011): The SC <strong>allowed passive euthanasia</strong> for the nurse lying in a vegetative state at a hospital in Mumbai.</li>
<li><strong>S. Puttaswamy case</strong>/ the Right to Privacy case (2017): – <strong>Article 21 includes the concept of individual dignity</strong> and thus allows passive euthanasia.</li>
<li><strong>Common Cause case (2018</strong>): The SC decided that passive euthanasia will be legally allowed henceforth in India and also laid down guidelines for living wills.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>“</em></strong><em>We declare that an adult human being having the mental capacity to take an <strong>informed decision</strong> has the right to refuse medical treatment including withdrawal from life-saving devices. <strong>The right to die with dignity is a part of the right to live with dignity</strong>.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Meaning of active and passive euthanasia:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A</strong><strong>ctive euthanasia:</strong> involves an active intervention to end a person’s life with substances or external force, such as administering a lethal injection.</li>
<li>Passive or negative or non-aggressive euthanasia is the <strong>denial of medical care necessary for maintaining life</strong>, such as the denial of antibiotics when the patient is likely to die without them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What changes after the SC’s recent order?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Different countries, different laws:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NETHERLANDS, LUXEMBOURG, and BELGIUM</strong> allow both euthanasia and assisted suicide (active euthanasia) for anyone who faces “unbearable suffering” that has no chance of improvement.</li>
<li><strong>SWITZERLAND bans euthanasia but allows assisted dying</strong> in the presence of a doctor or physician.</li>
<li><strong>CANADA</strong> had announced that euthanasia and assisted dying would be allowed for mentally ill patients, however, the decision has been widely criticised.</li>
<li><strong>The US</strong> has different laws in different states. Euthanasia is allowed in some states like Washington, Oregon, and Montana.</li>
<li><strong>The UK</strong> considers it illegal and equivalent to manslaughter<strong>.</strong></li>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/el-sisi-republic-day-chief-guest-significance-8402505/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Direction:</strong> The article highlights India-Egypt relations and discusses how the Republic Day chief guest is chosen by India.</p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> This is the <strong>first time</strong> that an Egyptian President (Abdel Fattah El-Sisi) has been invited as chief guest for the Republic Day celebrations in India.</p>
<p><strong>India-Egypt relations:</strong></p>
<p><strong>History:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>India and Egypt share close political understanding based on a long history of cooperation in <strong>bilateral, regional and global issues</strong>.</li>
<li>Diplomatic relations were established on August 18, <strong>1947</strong> (completed 75 years in 2022).</li>
<li>India’s PM Jawaharlal Nehru and Egypt’s President Gamal Abdel Nasser signed the <strong>Friendship Treaty</strong> between the two countries, and they were key to forming the <strong>Non-Aligned Movement</strong> (NAM in 1961) along with Yugoslav President Josip Broz Tito.</li>
<li>High-level exchanges with Egypt continued post <strong>2011 Egyptian Revolution</strong> and the new government led by President (Sisi) took over in 2014.</li>
<li>When the Egyptian President paid a State visit to India in 2016, a joint statement was issued, <strong>outlining the three pillars</strong>–<ul>
<li>Political-security cooperation,</li>
<li>Economic engagement and scientific collaboration and</li>
<li>Cultural and people-people ties as the basis of a new partnership for a new era.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The recent engagements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>India has invited Egypt as <strong>a special guest for the G-20 summit</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Exercise Cyclone-I</strong> – first ever exercise between Indian Army and Egyptian Army was held in Jaisalmer recently.</li>
<li>India and Egypt agreed to elevate their bilateral ties to a <strong>“Strategic Partnership”</strong> covering political, security, defence, energy, and economic aspects.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What’s the state of bilateral trade relations?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Egypt has traditionally been <strong>one of India’s most important trading partners</strong> in Africa, as they have had a bilateral trade agreement since 1978 based on the <strong>most-favoured nation clause.</strong></li>
<li>The bilateral trade has i<strong>ncreased more than five times</strong> (USD 26 billion in 2021-22 – a 75% increase from FY 2020-2021) in the past 10 years.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other areas of cooperation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Agriculture:</strong> Egypt is currently facing a shortage of food grains as its major sources were the <strong>warring Ukraine and Russia</strong>. In May last year, India- which had put a ban on the sale of wheat, allowed the export of 61,000 tonnes of wheat to Egypt.</li>
<li>Cyber security &amp; IT</li>
<li>Healthcare</li>
<li>Culture</li>
<li>Youth matters and Broadcasting</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/india-republic-day-chief-guest-process-protocol-significance-8403576/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Being invited as the chief guest at Republic Day celebrations is the <strong>highest honour a country accords in terms of protocol and the ultimate sign of friendship.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How is the Republic Day chief guest chosen?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The process starts nearly six months in advance of the event and all kinds of considerations (political, commercial, military, and economic interests of India) are taken into account by the <strong>Ministry of External Affairs (MEA)</strong> before extending the invitation.</li>
<li>Another factor for choosing Egypt: the association with the <strong>NAM</strong> which began in the late 1950s, early 1960s.</li>
<li><strong>The first Chief Guest</strong> of the parade in 1950 was President Sukarno of Indonesia, one of the five founding members of the NAM.</li>
<li>After due consideration, the MEA seeks the approval of the Prime Minister and the President on the matter.</li>
<li>The MEA does not choose one option but a list of potential candidates and <strong>discretion is of utmost importance</strong> as no formal invitation has yet been made by India.</li>
<li>After a candidate is finalised, the <strong>Chief of Protocol</strong> (Protocol Division, MEA) works on the details of the programme and logistics.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the significance of a Republic Day invite?</strong> Highly symbolic from the Indian government’s perspective as the choice is dictated by a number of reasons – strategic and diplomatic, business interests, and international geo-politics.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Research suggested that Earth’s inner core, a hot iron ball the size of Pluto, <strong>has stopped spinning faster than the planet’s surface and might now be rotating slower than it.</strong></p>
<p><strong>How does the core spin:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Studies have suggested that the inner core rotates <strong>within the liquid outer core</strong>.</li>
<li>The solid inner core is <strong>suspended, floating, in the molten outer core.</strong></li>
<li>Many researchers believe that the inner core’s <strong>independent rotation is caused by a process called convection.</strong> Its movement is caused by the outer core’s magnetic torque and balanced by gravitational force.</li>
<li>Researchers have also argued that the <strong>mantle’s immense gravitational pull</strong> may be the reason for the pause and shift in the inner core’s rotation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How do we study the inner core</strong>:</p>
<p>Scientists rely on <strong>seismic waves created by earthquakes or sometimes nuclear explosions</strong> –to know about the structure of the interior of the Earth.</p>

<h3 id="can-indias-bharos-replace-android-ios"><strong>Can India’s BharOS replace Android, iOS?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/bharos-why-seeing-the-indian-operating-system-on-a-smartphone-wont-be-easy-8404494/"><strong>Indian Express</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: Developed by an IIT Madras-incubated startup, <strong>BharOS</strong> is being pitched as India’s answer to the <strong>Google-owned Android and Apple’s iOS,</strong> the two most dominant mobile operating systems in the world.</p>
<p><strong>What is BharOS? How was it made?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>BharOS is an <strong>Android Open-Source Project</strong> and was developed by <strong>JandK Operations Private Limited, a non-profit organisation incubated at IIT Madras.</strong></li>
<li>Concerns existed with respect to the <strong>collection, storage, and usage of data that is generated by Indian smartphone users. BharOS tries to address these issues.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How is BharOS different from Android?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>BharOS uses <strong>AOSP or Android Open -Source Project,</strong> the functionalities and the methodologies both OS use are essentially the same.</li>
<li><strong>What sets BharOS apart from Android, is that it is free from Google Services and Apps.</strong> It comes with <strong>no default app (NDA),</strong> which allows users to have more control over permissions that an app can have.</li>
<li>Google has used its preinstalled apps and services to collect data, sometimes without explicitly asking a user. Similarly, other apps from Google’s PlayStore share data with third-party services. <strong>BharOS does not come with any such preinstalled services or apps, and hence, is deemed to be more secure.</strong></li>
<li>It also comes with a <strong>native over-the-air update (NOTA) feature</strong> that keeps the devices safe and with organisation-specific <strong>Private App Store Services (PASS),</strong> the device gives access to only those apps which have been thoroughly verified by the organization.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How will apps work on BharOS?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It will let users choose what <strong>apps they want to use for their own devices</strong>.</li>
<li>Furthermore, it will have its <strong>own app store which will allow users to download and install</strong> apps, eliminating the need for the Google App Store.</li>
<li>Users may be allowed to sideload apps in a much easier manner than Android allows.</li>
<li>Barring a few essential apps, <strong>BharOS may favour indigenously developed apps or apps that have been designed with a particular focus on India and Indian</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The indigenously-built BharOS paves the way for <strong>Atmanirbhar Bharat</strong> &amp; could help put a check on Big Tech and the duopoly of Google-Apple in the mobile ecosystem.</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: The Indian Railways has concluded the trial of an <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI) program</strong> built to <strong>fix a perennial issue — long waiting lists for tickets.</strong></p>
<p><strong>How it will work:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Made by Railways’ in-house software arm <strong>Centre for Railway Information Systems (CRIS</strong>), this AI module, called <strong>Ideal Train Profile</strong>, was fed with information like <strong>how millions of passengers booked tickets on these trains, which origin-destination pairs were a hit and which were flops at what time of the year,</strong> which seats remained vacant for what portion of a journey, etc.</li>
<li>The AI does data-driven <strong>remote location selection, completely automates the process of quota distribution, and suggests optimal quotas</strong> for different ticket combinations based on historical demand.</li>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1893580">PIB</a></p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: A team of scientists from the Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR) have used <strong>scandium nitride (ScN) and Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) compatibility to develop brain-like computing.</strong></p>
<p>This invention can provide a <strong>new material for stable, CMOS-compatible optoelectronic synaptic functionalities</strong> at a relatively <strong>lower energy cost</strong> and hence has the potential to be translated into an industrial product.</p>
<p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The human brain is a supreme biological computer that is smaller and more efficient due to the presence of a <strong>synapse (the connection between two neurons</strong>) that plays the role of both processor and memory storage unit. In the current era of <strong>artificial intelligence, the brain-like computing approach can help meet the escalating computational demands.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Scientists</strong> used <strong>ScN</strong> to develop a <strong>device mimicking a synapse</strong> that controls the signal transmission as well as remembers the signal.</li>
<li>An artificial optoelectronic synapse with ScN thin films that can mimic synaptic functionalities <strong>like short-term memory, long-term memory, the transition from short-term to long-term memory, learning–forgetting, frequency selective optical filtering, frequency-dependent potentiation and depression, Hebbian learning, and logic-gate operations</strong>.</li>
<li>It can act as a platform for both <strong>excitatory and inhibitory functions</strong>. The industrial processing techniques of ScN are similar to the existing semiconductor fabrication infrastructure. Response to the <strong>optical stimuli also has the advantage of possible integration with photonic circuits known for higher speed and broader bandwidth than electronic circuits.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/green-comet-close-to-earth-details-date-time-8401036/">Indian Express</a></p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: A green comet is estimated to come closest to Earth, termed the <strong>C/2022 E3 (ZTF),</strong> the comet was named to refer to those who first spotted it – <strong>astronomers using the wide-field survey camera at the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) in the US.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Green Comet:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Orbits sun in 50,000 years</li>
<li>The comet comes from the <strong>Oort cloud</strong></li>
<li>It gets its beautiful green glow from <strong>diatomic carbon</strong> (pairs of carbon atoms that are bound together) that is present in the comet’s head.</li>
<li>When <strong>the ultraviolet rays of solar radiation</strong> fall on the comet, these molecules emit green light.</li>
<li>Comet C/2022 E3 is <strong>visible in the northern hemisphere</strong> and as the sky gets darkens in the evening, it can be seen below and left to the Plough constellation handle.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About comets:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Comets are <strong>frozen rocky or gas-filled objects that are remnants of the formation of the solar system</strong>.</li>
<li>Due to their composition, characteristics, and the path they move in, they tend to leave a <strong>light “behind them</strong>”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Oort Cloud:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Oort Cloud is <strong>a predicted collection of icy objects that surrounds the sun at a distance of about one light-year.</strong></li>
<li>The existence of the Oort cloud has not been directly observed, but it is thought to be the source of long period comets that have been observed entering the inner solar system.</li>
