<p><strong>Context: A study jointly conducted by CRY — Child Rights and You and Chanakya National Law University, Patna stated that online sexual exploitation and abuse (OCSEA</strong>), has extended its presence across India during the pandemic and the extent of such crimes is becoming a matter of concern<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Key findings from POCSO and Beyond: Understanding Online Safety during COVID Report –</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Adolescent girls and boys <strong>within 14-18 years</strong>, belonging to <strong>the lower income strata were figured as the most vulnerable age group.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Just 30 per cent of the parents said they would go to the police station</strong> and file a complaint, while <strong>70 per cent ruled out that possibility.</strong></li>
<li>Only <strong>16 per cent of parents claimed to be familiar with any OCSEA-related laws</strong>, indicating a lack of information and faith in the legal system and law enforcement.</li>
<li>Nearly <strong>33 per cent of the parents</strong> among the respondents reported that <strong>strangers approached their children via Online Platforms</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Laws on sharing of online Child Sexual Abusive Material (CSAM) in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In India, <strong>viewing adult pornography in private is not an offence</strong>.</li>
<li>As per the <strong>Information Technology (IT) Act, 2002,</strong> it is punishable to show children any pornographic content.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Current system of detecting CSAM in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Help from foreign agencies</strong></li>
<li><strong>Operation Megh Chakra and Operation Carbon:</strong><strong>launched by the CBI</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/childe_abuse.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/childe_abuse-614x1024.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>India’s efforts so far:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>‘Aarambh India’:</strong> a Mumbai-based NGO, <strong>partnered with the IWF</strong>, and launched India’s first online reporting portal to report images and videos of child abuse.</li>
<li><strong>National cybercrime reporting portal</strong></li>
<li><strong>Jairam Ramesh Committee</strong> made recommendations on ‘the <strong>alarming issue of pornography on social media</strong> and its effect on children and society as a whole’.</li>
<li><strong>State governments</strong> are increasingly adopting “<strong>Child-Friendly Policing”</strong> to encourage reporting of abuses.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Major Initiatives for Preventing Child Sexual Abuse in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>POCSO Act, 2012</li>

<li>Strong feelings of <strong>hopelessness, suicidal ideation, and suicidal attempt</strong>.</li>
<li>Getting <strong>detached from family and friends</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ethical aspects related to Child Abuse:</strong></p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-3"><strong>GS Paper 3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Environment and Conservation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/analysis-why-has-the-creation-of-eco-sensitive-zones-provoked-protests/article66377452.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Direction:</strong> The article covers Ecologically sensitive zones (ESZ) and the issues related to the ESZ.</p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The creation of the <strong>Ecologically sensitive zones (ESZ)</strong> has sparked protests in Kerala and can be a hint of what is likely to occur in other parts of the country.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ESZ Context:</strong> The problem begins with a notification that ought to have been community-specific but which a ministry offered as a ‘one size fits all’ solution.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Protected areas cover <strong>5.</strong><strong>26% of India’s land area</strong> as 108 national parks and 564 wildlife sanctuaries notified under <strong>the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972</strong> (WPA).</li>
<li>These protected areas are based on the <strong>‘fortress conservation model’.</strong> For example, activities permitted in ‘reserve forests’ are not permitted in national parks and wildlife sanctuaries.</li>
<li>Surrounding these protected areas is an area of <strong>approx. 3.4%</strong> of the country’s land, falls under the <strong>ESZ regime</strong>.</li>
<li>Governments have notified 341 ESZs in 29 States and 5 UTs, while another 85 ESZs are awaiting notification.</li>
<li>Together, protected areas and the ESZs cover <strong>8.</strong><strong>66%</strong> of India’s land area.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are ESZ/Ecologically Fragile Areas (EFA)?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Meaning:</strong> ESZ is intended to protect ‘protected areas’ – national parks and wildlife sanctuaries – by effectively creating insulating layers around such protected areas where humans and nature can be at peace with each other.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives of creating ESZ:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To create a <strong>shock absorber</strong> by regulating and managing the activities around protected areas.</li>
<li>To serve as a <strong>transition zone</strong> between areas of high protection and areas of lower protection.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Notified and regulated by:</strong> They are notified by the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) and regulated under the Environment Protection Act 1986 (though the EPA does not mention the word ‘ESZ’).</p>
<p><strong>Criteria to designate ESZ:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Based on species (endemism, rarity, etc)</li>
<li>Based on the ecosystem (sacred groves, frontier forests, etc)</li>
<li>Based on geomorphological features (uninhabited islands, origins of rivers, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Extent of ESZ:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An ESZ’s distribution can <strong>vary in breadth and extent</strong>. <strong>For example,</strong> the extent of ESZ from the boundary of a protected area ranges from <strong>0 to 45.82 km</strong> (in Pin Valley National Park, HP).</li>
<li>The ESZs span notified forests outside protected areas, most of which could also come under gram sabhas’ jurisdiction under the FRA.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Issues with ESZ:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Not in sync with FRA and PESA:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Forest Rights Act (FRA) 2006, <strong>recognises the customary and traditional rights</strong> (both individual and collective) of forest-dwellers on forest land, including inside protected areas.<ul>
<li>Under the FRA, a new category of forests called ‘<strong>community forest resource</strong>’ (CFR) has been created and has to be managed by the Gram Sabhas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Similarly, the Provisions of <strong>the Panchayat (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act (PESA) 1996</strong>, empower Gram Sabhas to safeguard and preserve community resources on forest and revenue lands in Scheduled Areas.</li>
<li>However, the MoEFCC has shown no inclination to amend the Indian Forest Act 1927, the Wildlife (Protection) Act and the EPA 1986 to comply with PESA and FRA.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The case of Kerala:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Western Ghats</strong> (WG) cover 48% of Kerala and nearly 30% of the state is covered by forests.</li>
<li><strong>There is also a network of lakes</strong>, canals and wetlands, as well as a 590-kilometre-long coastline, all of which are governed by a set of environmental conservation laws.</li>
<li><strong>This leaves little space for its 3.5 crore population</strong>, which has a population density of 900 people per square km (much higher than the national average).</li>
<li>According to an SC directive, at least one km from the boundary of every protected area in Kerala should be marked as ESZ</li>
<li>The Kerala State Assembly recently unanimously passed a resolution urging the Central Government to exempt the state’s human settlements, farmlands, and public institutions from the ESZ’s scope.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mining and other activities have long depleted the nation’s natural resources.</li>
<li>As a result, the government’s role should not be limited to that of a “facilitator” of economic activity.</li>

<h4 id="gs-paper-3_1"><strong>GS Paper 3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus</strong>: Achievements of Indians in science &amp; technology.</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.livemint.com/companies/start-ups/indias-rocket-dreams-ready-for-a-liftoff-11673969838215.html"><strong>Live Mint</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: With the space sector opening up, startups have begun to rapidly transform the industry.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/private_sector.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/private_sector-1024x1024.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Measures for encouraging the private sector in the space programme:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe)</strong> in Ahmedabad.<ul>
<li><strong>IN-SPACe is an autonomous, single-window nodal agency</strong>; formed to promote, authorise, monitor and supervise the space activities of NonGovernmental Private Entities (NGPEs) in India.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>With the formation of IN-SPACE</strong>, over 100 companies have come up in this sector and in 2022 they raised as much as $110 million.</li>
<li><strong>R</strong><strong>eforms in the space sector</strong> enable more private players to provide end-to-end services.</li>
<li><strong>NewSpace India Ltd (NSIL),</strong> is mandated to transfer the matured technologies developed by the ISRO to Indian industries.</li>
<li><strong>Change in strategy</strong>: the <strong>present supply-based model</strong> has been changed to a <strong>demand-driven model</strong>, wherein NSIL shall act as an aggregator of user requirements and obtain commitments.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory regime:</strong><ul>
<li>The first to be updated was the <strong>SpaceCom and SpaceRS policies</strong>, further liberalizing the traditional Satellite Communication and Remote Sensing sectors, respectively, thus enabling entrepreneurs and industries to take up end-to-end activities in these domains</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Private players’ entry will support the Indian space Industry in the following ways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Participation in the private sector will give rise to <strong>new innovations and technology.</strong></li>
<li>It will provide an opportunity to harness the <strong>talent pool</strong> in the country, by providing them with immense opportunities for exploration.</li>
<li>A <strong>reduction in the cost of operation with efficient practices, building</strong> a supply chain to accommodate the downstream players.</li>
<li>Also, it will allow procuring <strong>non-Indian orbital resources</strong> to build their space-based systems for communication services in and outside India.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Private players find smaller satellite markets a more lucrative option.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Advantages of smaller satellites</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Smaller satellites <strong>use industry-grade rather than space-grade components</strong>.</li>
<li>These smaller satellites are <strong>parked closer to earth</strong>, where radiation is lower and have a shorter lifespan.</li>
<li>Moreover, while an <strong>INSAT class satellite will cost at least ₹400 crores</strong>, smaller satellites can be built for just <strong>₹10 crores</strong></li>
<li>Above all, they <strong>do not need large launch vehicles</strong> such as the PSLV or GSLV, which cost ₹300 crore and ₹450 crores, respectively.</li>
<li><strong>Potential:</strong> According to European Space Agency data, anywhere between 70,000 to 100,000 satellites will be launched in the next 15 years and over 80% will be small satellites weighing less than 500 kg.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Role of ISRO in the Private space industry:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The private sector will rely on ISRO for infrastructure</strong>—be it launch facilities, tracking systems, technology transfers and capacity building</li>
<li><strong>ISRO will focus on non-commercial greater complexity scientific missions</strong> such as focusing on deep-space missions and putting an Indian in space through its <strong>Gaganyaan</strong></li>
<li><strong>ISRO has set up NewSpace India Ltd (NSIL)</strong> to handle the commercial end of the business.</li>
<li>ISRO is <strong>the 6th largest space agency</strong> in the world and holds an exceptional success rate</li>
<li><strong>Indian Space Association (ISpA):</strong> ISpA aspires to be the collective voice of the Indian Space industry.</li>
<li>The introduction of <strong>the Indian Space Activities Bill</strong> will give greater clarity to private players on how to be an integral part of the space sector.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Limitations of the private sector in space:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Policy Bottlenecks:</strong> India is yet to legislate specific space laws to regulate the private sector. Hence, ensuring openness and clarity about the working framework becomes difficult in the current situation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Monopolization:</strong> Space is capital intensive industry, and only a few rich corporates can afford the investment. Hence, accommodating all players and ensuring an equitable platform becomes difficult.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Funding</strong>: India’s space budget of <strong>$1.7 billion</strong> (in 2022) was minuscule compared to the US’s $30 billion and China’s $14 billion (which includes $1 billion from its private players).</li>
<li><strong>Profit Motive:</strong> Space in general, should be an enabler of Technological equity for citizens. This aspect becomes difficult to ensure when private entities operate with <strong>profit interest.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Intellectual property issue:</strong> The lack of a robust space-centric IPR policy in India, raises issues regarding sharing and diversification of space resources.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>At present, India needs a space policy, which can be clear and liberal on private players. With this proposed new policy for space, India wants to <strong>tap into the private sector</strong>, which could help the industry grow.</p>

<p><strong>Prelims Links:</strong></p>
<p><strong>With reference to India’s satellite launch vehicles, consider the following statements: (UPSC 2018)</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>PSLVs launch the satellites useful for Earth resources monitoring whereas GSLVs are designed mainly to launch communication satellites.</li>
<li>Satellites launched by PSLV appear to remain permanently fixed in the same position in the sky, as viewed from a particular location on Earth.</li>
<li>GSLV Mk III is a four-staged launch vehicle with the first and third stages using solid rocket motors; and the second and fourth stages using liquid rocket engines.</li>
</ol>
<p>Which of the statements given above is/are correct?</p>
<p>(a) 1 only<br />
(b) 2 and 3<br />
(c) 1 and 2<br />
(d) 3 only</p>
<p><strong>Ans: A</strong></p>
<p>The satellites in geosynchronous orbits appear to remain permanently fixed in the same position in the sky. Hence, statement 2 is not correct.</p>
<p>GSLV-Mk III is a <strong>three-stage launch vehicle</strong> with four liquid strap-ons. The indigenously developed Cryogenic Upper Stage (CUS), forms the third stage of GSLV Mk III.</p>

<p>(MeitY) also launched the <strong>technology for biosensing systems</strong> for the <strong>detection of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals in aquatic ecosystems (MEAN)</strong> for <strong>qualitative and quantitative analysis of EDC content in water bodies</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>About EDC:</strong></p>
<p>Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are substances in the environment <strong>(natural</strong>– air, soil, or water) or <strong>manufactured (man-made) products that interfere with the normal function of the body’s endocrine system.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The most common EDCs are-</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bisphenol A (BPA)</strong> – used to make certain plastics and epoxy resins</li>
<li><strong>Dioxins</strong> – a byproduct in herbicide production and paper bleaching</li>
<li><strong>Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS)</strong> – used in a non-stick pan, paper and textile coatings</li>
<li><strong>Phthalates</strong> – used to make plastics more flexible</li>
<li><strong>Phytoestrogens</strong> – found in plants that have hormone-like activity, such as tofu or soy milk</li>
<li><strong>Triclosan</strong> – found in some anti-microbial and personal care products</li>
<li><strong>Endosulfan</strong> – an organochlorine insecticide that caused health hazards in the state of Kerala.</li>

<h3 id="what-is-a-pantranscriptome"><strong>What is a ‘pantranscriptome’?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/what-is-a-pantranscriptome/article66395987.ece">The Hindu</a></p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: A new study published in the journal Nature Methods, has proposed a “<strong>pantranscriptome</strong>,” which combines <strong>a transcriptome and a pangenome</strong> — a reference that <strong>contains genetic material from a cohort of diverse individuals, rather than just a single linear strand.</strong></p>
<p><strong>About Pan Transcriptome:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Using a reference genome from <strong>a single organism</strong> is not reliable and there exists considerable variation in the intra-specie genomes.</li>
<li>This gave birth to the pan- genomics<strong>,</strong> which divides the genome of the specie into three parts, core genome, dispensable genome, and unique genes.</li>
<li><strong>Transcriptome</strong> represents <strong>all the RNA molecules present in a specie or in an organism.</strong></li>
<li>Building a pan-transcriptome is necessary for studying and analyzing complex genomes and variations between species.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>RNA’s most commonly recognized function is to <strong>translate DNA into proteins</strong>, but scientists now understand that the vast majority of RNA does not make proteins, <strong>but instead can play roles such as influencing cell structure or regulating genes</strong>.</li>
<li>When evaluating an individual’s genomic data for variation, <strong>scientists compare the individual’s genome to that of a reference made up of a single, linear strand of DNA bases</strong>.</li>
<li>Using a pangenome allows <strong>researchers to compare an individual’s genome to that of a genetically diverse cohort of reference sequences all at once</strong>, sourced from individuals representing a diversity of biogeographic ancestry.</li>
<li>This gives the scientists more points of comparison for which to better understand an individual’s genomic variation.</li>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: Superconductivity was first discovered in <strong>mercury</strong>, yet scientists required <strong>111 years</strong> to explain how it becomes superconducting</p>
<p>In 1911, Dutch physicist <strong>Heike Kamerlingh Onnes</strong> discovered superconductivity in mercury. He found that at a very low temperature, called the <strong>threshold temperature</strong>, <strong>solid mercury</strong> offers no resistance to the flow of electric current.</p>

<p><strong>About Mercury:</strong></p>
<p>Mercury is a <strong>naturally occurring element</strong> that is found in air, water and soil. It is released into the atmosphere through <strong>natural processes</strong> such as weathering of rocks, volcanic eruptions, geothermal activities, forest fires, etc. It is the <strong>only metal which remains liquid at room temperature</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/mecury.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/mecury-1024x683.jpg" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>About Superconductivity:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Superconductors</strong> are materials that <strong>conduct electricity</strong> with no resistance. Unlike the more familiar conductors such as copper or steel, a superconductor can <strong>carry a current indefinitely without losing any energy.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advantages of superconductors</strong>: low power dissipation, high-speed operation, and high sensitivity</li>
<li><strong>Application</strong>: E.g. MRI machines, Particle accelerators, Power utilities, electronics companies, the military, and transportation.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Meissner effect</strong></p>
<p>When a <strong>material makes the transition</strong> from the normal to the superconducting state, it actively excludes magnetic fields from its interior; this is called the Meissner effect.</p>
