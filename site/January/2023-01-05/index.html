<h4 id="gs-paper-1"><strong>GS Paper 1</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus: Arts and Culture</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/asi-protected-monuments-untraceable-missing-8359347/"><strong>Indian Express</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: The Ministry of Culture recently told Parliamentary Standing Committee that <strong>50 of India’s 3,693 Centrally Protected Monuments (CPM)</strong> were missing</p>
<ul>
<li>Previously in <strong>2013, a CAG report</strong> said that at least <strong>92 centrally protected monuments</strong> across the country had gone missing. But since then, 42 CPMs have been identified by ASI.</li>
<li><strong>Examples of monuments missing</strong>: Barakhamba Cemetery (Delhi), Guns of Emperor Sher Shah, Tinsukia (Assam); the Ruins of Copper Temple, Paya, Lohit (Arunachal Pradesh) etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are protected monuments?</strong></p>
<p>A protected monument means an <strong>ancient monument</strong> which is declared to be of <strong>national importance</strong> by or under the Ancient Monuments and Archeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958.</p>
<ul>
<li>AMASR Act regulates the <strong>preservation of monuments and archaeological sites</strong> of national importance</li>
<li>The Act protects monuments and sites that are <strong>more than 100 years old</strong>, including temples, cemeteries, inscriptions, cannons, etc.</li>
<li>According to the provisions of the AMASR Act, <strong>ASI officials are supposed to regularly inspect the monuments</strong>, assess their conditions, issue show cause notices for removal of any encroachment, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How can a monument go “missing”?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Many of the monuments documented more than a century ago can no longer be found at their designated sites. The reasons can be:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Government focus on the social issue rather than heritage: In the decade following the independence, the</strong> focus of successive governments was on health, education and infrastructure, rather than protecting heritage.<ul>
<li>Even within the scope of heritage, the aim was to <strong>uncover more monuments</strong> and sites, instead of conservation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rapid urbanization</strong>: 14 monuments have been lost to rapid urbanisation</li>
<li><strong>Submergence by reservoir/dams</strong>: 12 are submerged by reservoirs/dams</li>
<li><strong>Difficulties in tracing in remote locations</strong>: 24 are untraceable</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations by the Standing Committee</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mandatorily survey</strong> <strong>all the CPMs sites physically</strong>: ASI had previously admitted that a comprehensive physical survey of all monuments has never been conducted after Independence</li>
<li><strong>Provide budgetary allocation</strong> and assess security requirements</li>
<li><strong>Involving local community</strong> including local Panchayats and Police</li>
<li><strong>Use of technology such</strong> as GPS, Geo-location, and Geo-tagging to trace monuments</li>
<li><strong>Enhance manpower of ASI:</strong> ASI currently faces an acute manpower shortage to physically man all the big and small monuments which may fall under a particular region</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Previous recommendation by CAG: A periodic inspection of each protected monument</strong> be carried out by a suitably ranked officer.</p>
<p><strong>Can the ‘missing CPM’ be deleted from the List of national Monuments?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deleting the lost/untraceable monuments</strong> from the protected list is possible but is <strong>a long-drawn process</strong></li>
<li>The deletion requires <strong>denotification of the said monument under Section 35 of the AMASR Act.</strong></li>
<li>However, <strong>experts say that deleting untraceable monuments is not advisable</strong> from the list, because once that is done, there would be no imperative to find them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About ASI:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Archeological Survey of India (ASI)</strong> is an <strong>attached office of the Ministry of Culture (MoC)</strong> and is in charge of the protection and maintenance of centrally protected monuments (declared under <strong>Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR)</strong> Act, 1958).</p>
<ul>
<li>The ASI was founded in <strong>1861 by Alexander Cunningham</strong> when he realised the need for a permanent body to oversee archaeological excavations and conservation.</li>
<li><strong>Lord Curzon (1899-1905) passed the law in 1904</strong>(Ancient Monuments Preservation Act, 1904) that made the destruction of Ancient Monuments as an offence and directed officials to collect and preserve ancient monuments.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="gs-paper-1_1"><strong>GS Paper 1</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus: Indian Geography</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/wildlife-biodiversity/rubber-plantations-in-tripura-affecting-monkeys-vegetation-suggests-paper-86942"><strong>DTE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong>  The research article, Impact of Monoculture Rubber Plantation on non-Human Primates and Plant Diversity in South Tripura, has warned against monoculture farms and suggest eco-friendly measures to increase biodiversity</p>
<p><strong>Major findings</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The conversion of tropical forests into monoculture plantations has a major effect on <strong>non-human primates and plant species</strong>.<ul>
<li>g., <strong>Turning the forests into natural rubber plantations</strong> in Tripura is negatively impacting <strong>non-human primate species and vegetation</strong> in the region.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Humans are overusing the world’s tropical forests</strong>: As per the WWF, every year, about 140,000 square kilometres of forests have been lost<ul>
<li><strong>A large proportion of primary forest</strong> in India has been converted into <strong>monoculture plantations</strong> like tea, oil palm, teak and natural rubber</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Impact on animals:</strong> The number of monkeys in the rubber plantation area is <strong>much lower than</strong> in the nearby forests and the primates spend less time in rubber plantations<ul>
<li>Due to the <strong>growing rubber plantations</strong>, they do not get enough food, which makes their survival difficult. This threatens the <strong>species and the primates can go extinct,</strong> disrupting the environment’s natural state.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the importance of Non-human primates?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Non-human primates are of central importance to <strong>tropical biodiversity and various ecosystem</strong></li>
<li>They are <strong>humans’ nearest biological relatives</strong> and play a significant role in many societies’ livelihoods, cultures and religions, the paper said.</li>
<li>These primates help in the <strong>pollination, seed dispersion and seed germination</strong> of many plants and they are essential seed predators in some ecosystems.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Solutions suggested</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Building eco-friendly rubber plantations</strong>: Growing fruiting plants in rubber plantation areas, maintaining specified distance, so animals are more attracted to them.</li>
<li><strong>Various plants should also be kept intact</strong> at the edges of the rubber plantation and around the water bodies, which provide shelter or food habitat for many animals in these areas</li>
<li><strong>The agroforestry system allows rubber plants</strong>, forest vegetation, and edible and useful plants planted together and kept at proper intervals, which is economically suitable and also will help conserve biodiversity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other impacts of Monoculture farming:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Continuous monoculture, or “<strong>monocropping</strong>” where the <strong>same species is grown year after year</strong>, can lead to <strong>unsustainable environments</strong> such as building up <strong>disease pressure</strong> and reducing particular nutrients in the soil. Under certain circumstances, <strong>monocropping</strong> can lead to <strong>deforestation</strong></li>
<li>It reduces the <strong>availability of certain nutrients and degrades the soil</strong>. Monocultures may therefore also <strong>lead to soil exhaustion</strong> when the soil becomes depleted of these nutrients.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Primates</strong>: They are a member of the <strong>most developed and intelligent group of mammals</strong>, including humans, monkeys, and apes.</p>
<p><strong>Fourteen species of nonhuman primates occur in India</strong>—six species of macaques, five of langurs, two of looses, and one species of <strong>gibbon</strong> (ape)</p>

<p><strong>Syllabus: Polity: 5th and 6th Schedule</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/explained-why-has-a-high-power-ladakh-committee-been-formed/article66339539.ece">The Hindu</a></p>
<p><strong>Syllabus</strong>: Indian Constitution- historical underpinnings, evolution, features, amendments, significant provisions and basic structure</p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: Recently a <strong>high-powered committee</strong> has been formed in the <strong>Union Territory of Ladakh</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Need for the committee:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There has been increasing demand for the <strong>inclusion of Ladakh under the 6th</strong></li>
<li>Civil society groups in Ladakh have been <strong>demanding the protection of land, resources and employment for the past three years</strong> after the special status of the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370.</li>
<li>The committee will discuss measures to protect the <strong>region’s unique culture and language</strong> taking into consideration its <strong>geographical location and strategic importance; ensure the protection of land and employment for the people of Ladakh;</strong> strategies for inclusive development and discuss issues related to the empowerment of the Ladakh Autonomous Hill District Councils of Leh and Kargil.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sixth Schedule</strong></p>
<p>The sixth schedule under <strong>Article 244</strong> of the Constitution protects the <strong>autonomy of tribal populations</strong> through the creation of <strong>autonomous development councils</strong> which can frame laws <strong>on land, public health and agriculture</strong>. As of now, ten autonomous councils exist in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram.</p>
<p><strong>NCST Recommendation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST) has recommended that the <strong>Union Territory (UT) of Ladakh be included in the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reasons behind the demand:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is estimated that more than <strong>90% of Ladakh’s population is tribal</strong>. The primary Scheduled Tribes (STs) in Ladakh are <strong>Balti Beda, Bot (or Boto), Brokpa (or Drokpa, Dard, Shin), Changpa, Garra, Mon and Purigpa.</strong></li>
<li>The Ladakh region has several distinct cultural heritages by communities such as <strong>Drokpa, Balti and Changpa, among others, which need to be preserved and promoted.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the government’s stand?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Not <strong>keen to give any special status to Ladakh</strong>, the <strong>MHA informed a parliamentary standing committee</strong> recently that the <strong>objective for inclusion of the tribal population under the sixth schedule</strong> is to ensure their overall socio-economic development, which, the <strong>UT administration has already been taking care of and that sufficient funds are being provided to Ladakh to meet its overall developmental requirements</strong>.</li>
<li>The Ladakh administration recently increased the reservation for the Scheduled Tribes in direct recruitment from <strong>10% to 45% which will significantly help the tribal population in their development.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="gs-paper-4"><strong>GS Paper 4</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus: Applications of Ethics</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/what-is-ethical-animal-research-a-scientist-and-veterinarian-explain/article66177724.ece">The Hindu</a></p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: Globally <strong>there is concern about ethical issues related to animal research. Recently, a</strong> proposed measure in <strong>Switzerland would have made that country the first to ban medical and scientific experimentation on animals</strong> but it failed to pass with only 21% of voters in favour.</p>
<p><strong>About Animal research:</strong></p>
<p>Animal research or Experimentation involves the <strong>use of animals to develop and test the safety of new medicines, drugs, cosmetics, medical procedures and other industry products</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Ethical issues involved in animal research:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The moral status of an animal.</li>
<li>Innate rights of animals</li>
<li>Distinguish between testing on animals and infants or disabled humans</li>
<li>The inability of the animals to consent.</li>
<li>Lack of proven benefits to humans, out of these methods.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Arguments in favour of Animal research:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Life-saving cures and treatments</li>
<li>No proper alternative for testing.</li>
<li>Overcome <strong>ethical considerations</strong> involved in the <strong>use of human subjects</strong></li>
<li>Shorter life cycles of animals.</li>
<li><strong>Animal treatments</strong> are developed during their experimentation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Arguments against Animal research:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Time- and resource-intensive</li>
<li>In many cases, do not correctly predict real-world human reactions and do not ensure safety</li>
<li><strong>Anatomic, metabolic, and cellular differences</strong> between animals and humans.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Alternatives to animal testing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In vitro methods i.e. <strong>using human cell cultures and tissues</strong>g. organs-on-a-chip</li>
<li>In silico methods i.e. <strong>advanced computer-modelling</strong></li>
<li>Engagement of human volunteers</li>
<li><strong>Using simulators</strong> for medical training.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Guidelines for Animal Research: As followed by Federal Agency and EU</strong></p>
<p>Video Player</p>
<p>00:00</p>
<p>00:07</p>
<p><strong>Ethical aspects followed in other countries:</strong></p>
<p>In the U.S., the <strong>Animal Welfare Act protects all warm-blooded animals except rats, mice and birds bred for research</strong>. Rats, mice and birds are protected – along with fish, reptiles and all other vertebrates – by the <strong>Public Health Service Policy.</strong></p>
<p>The basic national standards for humane treatment, research institutions across 47 countries, including the U.S., may seek <strong>voluntary accreditation by a nonprofit called the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care</strong>, or AAALAC International. AAALAC accreditation recognizes the maintenance of <strong>high standards of animal care and</strong> use.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Animal research benefits both humans and animals. Numerous medical advances exist because they were initially studied in animals – from treatments for cancer and neurodegenerative disease to new techniques for surgery, organ transplants and non-invasive imaging and diagnostics.</p>

<p><strong>Walter Cunningham, a civilian astronaut</strong> whose only mission in space, aboard <strong>Apollo 7</strong>, revived NASA’s quest to put men on the moon in the wake of a <strong>landing-pad fire</strong> that killed <strong>three astronauts</strong>, died recently.</p>
<p><strong>Learning from his life:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiple profiles</strong>: Cunningham was a physicist and a former Marine pilot as well as an astronaut</li>
<li><strong>Many 1st</strong>: He became the first NASA astronaut to appear on television from space.</li>
<li><strong>Courage</strong>: His team’s flight — <strong>the first manned Apollo mission</strong> — buoyed an America shocked by the <strong>capsule fire</strong> that <strong>took 3 lives</strong> (in rehearsal mission for Apollo 1 mission in January 1967)</li>
<li><strong>Hope</strong>: He had said that “We carried the nation’s hope with us”</li>
<li><strong>Leadership</strong>: Soon after Apollo 7, Cunningham was named <strong>director</strong> of what became known as the <strong>Skylab program</strong>, which developed America’s first space station.</li>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: <strong>The food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)</strong> has released this report, under the framework of <strong>FAO’s Green Urban Oases Programme</strong></p>
<p><strong>Key points highlighted by the report:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>35% of the world’s largest cities</strong> (including New Delhi, Mexico City etc.) are built on the world’s dryland</li>
<li><strong>Urban policies</strong> have yet to incorporate <strong>forestry and greening strategies</strong> in the majority of dryland cities</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Select local trees for green spacing</li>
<li>Build local capacity and involve the community to create a sense of ownership</li>
<li>Create policies for urban greening</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About the Green Urban Oases (GUO) Programme:</strong></p>
<p>GUO program contributes to FAO’s Green Cities Initiative (2020) which aimed to improve the livelihoods of urban and peri-urban populations in at least 100 cities in the next 3 years.</p>
<p><strong>The objective of the programme</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn dryland cities into <strong>“green urban oases</strong>”</li>
<li><strong>Strengthen their overall resilience</strong> to climatic, health, food, and economic crisis</li>
<li><strong>To reduce the impact of urbanization on biodiversity</strong> and the surrounding natural environment</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are drylands?</strong></p>
<p><strong>United Nations Environment Programme (</strong>UNEP) defines drylands according to an <strong>aridity index (AI),</strong> which is the ratio between average <strong>annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration</strong>; drylands are lands with an AI of less than <strong>0.65</strong> (Zero Point six five)</p>
<p>Dryland systems <strong>are ecosystems characterised by a lack of water</strong>. They include cultivated lands, scrublands, shrublands, grasslands, savannas, semi-deserts and true deserts. It makes up around 41% of the earth’s land ( mainly in Asia and Africa).</p>
