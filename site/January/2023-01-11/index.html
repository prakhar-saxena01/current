<h4 id="gs-paper-3"><strong>GS Paper 3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Environment and Conservation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/ozone-hole-filling-up-now-antarctica-montreal-protocol-greenhouse-gases-climate-change-8374040/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Direction:</strong> The article discusses the efforts made to repair the ozone hole and how these efforts paid off.</p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The ozone hole, previously thought to be the most serious threat to planetary life, is now predicted to be completely healed by 2066.</li>
<li>This is stated in an UN-backed scientific team report titled ‘Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion 2022’.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key highlights of the report:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The ozone layer is predicted to return to 1980 levels</strong> over Antarctica by 2066, 2045 for the Arctic, and 2040 for the remainder of the planet.</li>
<li>The ozone hole has been steadily improving since 2000, thanks to the <strong>Montreal Protocol’s</strong> (1987) effective implementation.<ul>
<li>The Montreal Protocol mandates countries to phase out production of all main <strong>ozone depleting substances</strong> (ODSs).</li>
<li><strong>The Kigali Amendment</strong> (2016) to the Montreal Protocol aims to phase down 80-90% of the hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) currently in use by 2050.</li>
<li><strong>HFCs have replaced chlorofluorocarbons</strong> (CFCs) in industrial use and the amendment seeks to prevent additional 0.3 to 0.5 degree Celsius of global warming by the end of the century.</li>
<li>HFCs do not cause much ozone layer damage, which is why they were not originally prohibited, but they are <strong>extremely powerful greenhouse gases</strong> (GHGs).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nearly 99% of the Montreal Protocol-banned substances have now been phased out of usage, resulting in a <strong>slow but steady rebuilding of the ozone layer.</strong></li>
<li>The eradication of ODSs has a <strong>significant climate change co-benefit</strong> because these compounds are also potent GHGs, expected to prevent 0.5 to 1 degree Celsius of warming by 2050.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is it possible to use the success of repairing the ozone hole to slow the rate of global warming?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The success of the Montreal Protocol in closing the ozone hole is widely mentioned as a <strong>model for climate action.</strong></li>
<li>However, the parallels between the eradication of ODSs and the reduction of GHGs are limited because <strong>the usage of ODSs (though widespread) was limited to a few specific industries and their replacements were readily available.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The case of fossil fuels is very different</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>CO2 emissions are directly related to energy production and it is <strong>produced by almost every economic activity.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Even so-called renewable energies</strong>, such as solar and wind, have significant carbon footprints due to the use of fossil fuels in their manufacturing, transportation, and operation.</li>
<li><strong>Methane</strong> emissions, the other primary GHG, are primarily caused by agricultural operations and livestock.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The influence of reducing GHG emissions is <strong>not restricted to a few economic sectors</strong>, but affects the entire economy, as well as human lifestyles, habits, and behaviours.</li>
<li>Without a question, dealing with climate change is a considerably more challenging and complex problem than dealing with ozone depletion.</li>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://bfsi.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/industry/world-bank-recession-a-looming-threat-for-global-economy/96891441#:~:text=The%20global%20economy%20will%20come,World%20Bank%20warned%20on%20Tuesday."><strong>ET</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> According to the World Bank’s annual report, the global economy will come “dangerously close” to a recession this year, <strong>owing to poorer growth in all of the world’s top economies</strong> – the United States, Europe, and China.</p>
<p><strong>Warning signs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The WB has reduced its forecast for global growth this year by nearly half, <strong>to 1.7%, from 3% previously.</strong></li>
<li>If that projection is correct, it will be the <strong>third-weakest yearly expansion</strong> in three decades, trailing only the massive recessions caused by the 2008 global financial crisis and the 2020 coronavirus pandemic.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The impact of a global downturn:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It would fall particularly hard on poorer countries in such areas as Saharan Africa, which is home to 60% of the world’s poor.</li>
<li>Weakness in growth and business investment will <strong>exacerbate the already terrible reversals in education, health, poverty, and infrastructure</strong>, as well as the rising demands of climate change.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The US announced to extend COVID-19 pandemic-era restrictions, known as Title 42, to expel migrants from Nicaragua, Cuba and Haiti caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border back to Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, U.S. health authorities issued Title 42 to allow border agents to rapidly send migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border back to Mexico or other countries.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-cold-wave"><strong>What is a cold wave?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/what-is-cold-wave-northwest-india-shivering-8373312/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Delhi and other parts of northwest India have been currently reeling under a cold wave spell.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> In Delhi (the Safdarjung weather station), the lowest minimum temperature recorded this month was <strong>1.9 degrees Celsius</strong> on January 8.</p>
<p><strong>What is a cold wave?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In the plains, the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) <strong>marks a cold wave in terms of minimum temperatures</strong> –<ul>
<li>When the minimum temperature is 4 degrees or less or</li>
<li>When the minimum temperature is less than 10 degrees and 4.5 to 6.4 degrees below the normal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reasons for the temperature drop in north and north-west India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Large-scale fog cover</strong>, preventing sunlight from reaching the surface and affecting the radiation balance<strong>.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Light winds and high moisture near the land surface</strong> have been contributing to the fog.</li>
<li>Foggy or cloudy nights are usually associated with warmer nights, <strong>but if the fog remains for two or three days, cooling begins even at night.</strong></li>
<li>While <strong>westerly and north-westerly winds</strong> of around 5 to 10 kmph in the afternoon have also been contributing to the dip in temperature.</li>
<li>Absence of <strong>western disturbances</strong> over the region. Western disturbances are storms from the Mediterranean region, which are associated with a change in wind direction, bringing easterly winds to northwest India.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="section-6a-of-the-citizenship-act-1955"><strong>Section 6A of the Citizenship Act, 1955</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/section-6a-case-up-for-preliminary-determination-by-sc-constitution-bench/article66362225.ece#:~:text=Section%206A%20was%20a%20special,heritage%2C%20linguistic%20and%20social%20identity"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> A Constitution Bench led by Chief Justice of India said it will first take up for preliminary assessment if Section 6A of the Citizenship Act, 1955 suffers from any “constitutional infirmity”.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Petitions were filed to challenge Section 6A’s “<strong>discriminatory</strong>” nature in granting citizenship to illegal immigrants.</li>
<li>The petitioners said that the special clause violated <strong>Article 6 of the Indian Constitution</strong>, which established July 19, 1948 as the threshold for awarding citizenship to immigrants.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Section 6A:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It was a specific provision incorporated into the 1955 Act in pursuance of the ‘<strong>Assam Accord</strong>,’ which was signed on August 15, 1985 by the then-central government with the leaders of the Assam Movement.</li>
<li>The Accord came at the culmination of a six-year campaign by the All-Assam Students Union (AASU) to <strong>identify and deport illegal immigrants</strong> (entered after March 25, 1971) <strong>from the state</strong>, largely from neighbouring Bangladesh.</li>
<li>Under Section 6A, foreigners who had entered Assam <strong>before January 1, 1966</strong>, and been “ordinarily resident” in the State, would have all the rights and obligations of Indian citizens.</li>
<li>Those who had entered the State <strong>between January 1, 1966 and March 25, 1971</strong> would have the same rights and obligations except that they would not be able to vote for 10 years.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="very-short-range-air-defence-system-or-vshorad"><strong>Very Short-Range Air Defence System or VSHORAD</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/vshorad-missile-systearmy-mountain-warfare-prowess-8375754/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) accorded Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) to procure the Very Short-Range Air Defence System or VSHORAD (Infrared Homing) missile system, <strong>designed and developed by the DRDO</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The development comes amid the ongoing military standoff with China at the LAC in eastern Ladakh.</li>
<li>India has been in talks with Russia since 2018 to procure the <strong>Igla-S air defence missiles</strong> at a cost of $1.5 billion under the VSHORAD programme in a bid to replace the Russian <strong>Igla-M</strong> systems which have been in use with the Army.</li>
<li>However, there has been little progress on that front with the government pitching for <strong>Atma Nirbharta (self-dependence) in defence</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the missile system?</strong> Meant to kill <strong>low altitude aerial threats at short ranges</strong>, VSHORADS is a man portable Air Defence System (MANPAD) designed and developed indigenously by DRDO in a way to ensure easy portability.</p>
<p><strong>How will it help India?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Being man portable and lightweight, it can be deployed in the <strong>mountains close to the LAC</strong> at a short notice.</li>
<li>Others like the Akash Short Range Surface to Air Missile System are <strong>heavier with a theatre air defence umbrella</strong> of up to 25 km.</li>
</ul>
