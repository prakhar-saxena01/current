<p><strong>Summary of the 2023</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-geography-2/indian-climate/indian-monsoon/"><strong>Southwest Monsoon</strong></a> <strong>Season Rainfall:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>According to the IMD, the country as a whole is likely to receive <strong>96%</strong> of the southwest monsoon from June to September and farmers need not worry about deficient rainfall.</li>
<li>The monsoon is the <strong>lifeblood of the world’s fifth-largest economy.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Nearly half of the country’s net-sown area lacks irrigation access</strong>, making the rain-bearing system vital → <strong>replenishing natural reservoirs</strong> → feeding power generation, factories and drinking supply.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/lpa.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/lpa.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>El Nino in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In 1997, India faced the strongest El Nino ever, but the monsoon was normal.</li>
<li>Between 2001 and 2020, India saw <strong>seven El Nino years</strong> → Of these, <strong>4 resulted in droughts</strong> (2003, 2005, 2009-10, 2015-16).</li>
<li>These years also saw <strong>kharif or summer-sown farm output</strong> (accounting for nearly half of the country’s annual food supply) <strong>decline</strong> by 16%, 8%, 10% and 3%, leading to <strong>inflation</strong>.</li>
<li>The 2023 El Nino is expected to develop following <strong>a triple dip La Nina event</strong> (2020-22).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Threats posed by El Nino:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A slippage of one percentage point</strong> in monsoon rainfall will mean a below-normal monsoon.</li>
<li>Drought drives up inflation, erodes farm incomes, reduces spending on consumer goods and hurts the overall economy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Good news for India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A currently positive</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-geography-2/indian-climate/indian-monsoon/mechanism-of-formation-of-indian-monsoon/recent-concepts/role-of-indian-ocean-dipole-iod/#:~:text=It%20is%20defined%20by%20the,Indian%20Ocean%20south%20of%20Indonesia."><strong>Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)</strong></a> – temperature difference between two spots (western and eastern) in the Indian Ocean – boosts the rains and thwarts an El Nino. IOD is the.</li>
<li><strong>Droughts are no longer the disaster they used to be</strong>, thanks to a significant leap in farm productivity.<ul>
<li>The country’s food output has risen sharply from about 50 million tonnes in 1950-51 to 323.5 million tonnes during 2022-23.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>This will help avoid a scary “Malthusian world”</strong> of food production not keeping pace with population growth.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Additional steps needed to protect farmers:</strong> Setting up a <strong>system for specific advisory services and forecasts</strong> for all the districts based on different rainfall scenarios.</p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-1_1"><strong>GS Paper 1</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Role of Women and Women’s Organization</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/food/fao-closing-gender-gap-in-agri-food-systems-can-boost-global-economy-by-1-trillion-88767"><strong>DTE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> According to a new report – <strong>The Status Of Women In Agrifood Systems – by the FAO</strong>, tackling gender inequality in agri-food systems can reduce hunger, boost the economy and reinforce resilience to shocks like climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>Framework for gendered agrifood system:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/structural.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/structural.jpg?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>About the report:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It is the first of its kind since 2010</strong> (State of Food and Agriculture (SOFA) 2010–11: Women in Agriculture – Closing the gender gap for development).</li>
<li><strong>It goes beyond agriculture</strong> to provide a comprehensive picture of the status of women working across agri-food systems.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Highlights of the report:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Almost four billion people</strong> rely on agri-food systems for their livelihoods and <strong>around half of them (are women)</strong> are prevented from realising their potential.</li>
<li>They are often held back by<ul>
<li><strong>Inequality and discrimination</strong> – Rigid gender norms and roles, unequal power dynamics and discriminatory social structures</li>
<li><strong>Marginalised and denied agency</strong></li>
<li>Work in poorer conditions with lower wages and</li>
<li>Carry a greater burden of care and unpaid work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>These impediments are <strong>compounded by additional challenges</strong> – climate, economic and price shocks, conflicts and the increasing risks of gender-based violence.</li>
<li>Even though women have gained more access to some resources (digital technology, financial services), <strong>gaps are either unchanged or growing</strong> especially for rural women.</li>
<li><strong>Since the outbreak of COVID-19</strong>, the gap between women’s and men’s food security has grown to <strong>4.</strong><strong>3%.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>India-specific findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Female participation in the labour force is low (1 in 5 women are working or looking for a job) but <strong>labour-force participation is relatively high</strong> among the poorest women, who depend on agriculture.</li>
<li><strong>The female share of agrifood-system workers</strong> decreased by one percentage point between 2005 and 2019.</li>
<li><strong>A 10% increase in mechanized tillin</strong>g between 1999 and 2011 led to a <strong>5% reduction in women’s farm labour</strong> with no increase in off-farm work because of limited off-farm opportunities for women.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Closing the gender gap and empowering women would:</strong> I<strong>ncrease global GDP by 1%/nearly $1 trillion</strong> → address the goals of <strong>ending poverty and reducing food-nutritional insecurity.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suggestions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Women need more access</strong> to and control over the livestock, water, seeds, land, technology, and finance.</li>
<li><strong>Eliminating discrimination</strong> by engaging with men and boys.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Some best practices from India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In Tamil Nadu</strong>, women involved in fishing-related work had wider social networks, and a greater adaptive capacity to seasonal stresses.</li>
<li><strong>The</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/03/21/mgnrega-2/#:~:text=About%20MGNREGA%3A,enhance%20their%20quality%20of%20life."><strong>MGNREG Scheme</strong></a> stipulates the provision of crèche facilities for young children for women involved in the schemes.</li>
<li>In northern India, <strong>participatory village committees</strong> addressing water access, health and nutrition issues have facilitated shifts in discriminatory norms, enabling women to speak in front of men and take on public roles.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Two recent comments of the SC will have a direct bearing on the concept of the independence of various constitutional authorities in India.</p>
<p><strong>SC on the working of 2 key constitutional authorities:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/03/12/insights-into-editorial-the-office-of-the-governor/"><strong>Role of Governors in State politics</strong></a><strong>:</strong> In a hearing of the ‘Sena versus Sena’ case, the Court expressed that <strong>Governors becoming part of political processes is disconcerting</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Independence of the Election Commission of India:</strong> The Court divested the executive of its sole discretion in <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/03/how-are-the-cec-and-ecs-appointed-and-what-has-the-supreme-court-order-changed/">appointing the CEC and ECs</a> by forming a committee to suggest suitable names to man these constitutional posts.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Need for independent institutions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Democracy requires <strong>a system of checks and balances</strong> to prevent the arbitrary use of power by the elected government.</li>
<li><strong>India’s democracy provides for various constitutional authorities</strong> such as the Public Service Commission, <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/governance/appointment-to-various-constitutional-posts-powers-functions-and-responsibilities-of-various-constitutional-bodies/cag/">the CAG</a>, the ECI, the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/functions-and-responsibilities-of-the-union-and-the-states-issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure-devolution-of-powers-and-finances-up-to-local-levels-and-challenges-therein/issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure/centre-state-relations/finance-commission/">Finance Commission</a>, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Such bodies need complete independence –</strong><ul>
<li>To regulate sectors of national importance without any executive interference.</li>
<li>To enable them to function <strong>without fear or favour</strong> and in the larger interests of the nation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How does the Indian constitution ensure their independence?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Empowering the <strong>President</strong> of India to appoint all constitutional authorities</li>
<li><strong>Provides for the appointment/condition of service</strong> of individuals heading these institutions</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Loose ends left by the Constitution:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Used simple words</strong> such as<ul>
<li>‘<strong>shall be appointed by the President</strong>’ in the appointment of the PM (Article 75), the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/06/29/attorney-general-3/">Attorney-General for India</a> (Article 76), etc.</li>
<li>Article 324 provides that the President will appoint the CEC and ECs ‘<strong>subject to any law made on that behalf by Parliament</strong>’.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The President acts on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers</strong>, with the PM as the head in all matters.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Some best practices in the Indian constitution:</strong> The Constitution affixes the phrase “<strong>by warrant under his hand and seal</strong>” only to refer to appointment to positions (SC, HCs Judges; the CAG and the Governors) – <strong>distinguishing them from other constitutional positions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Further reforms needed:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Set up well-defined criteria and procedures</strong> for the appointment of the CAG and the Governor.</li>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> the process of selecting <strong>CAG should begin by appointing a committee</strong> → shortlisting names → a panel of three names should be forwarded to the President to make the final selection.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> World Health Organisation (WHO) has released a draft document outlining <strong>a global framework</strong> to prepare countries for the <strong>introduction of new tuberculosis (TB)</strong> vaccines for adults and adolescents.</p>
<p><strong>What is tuberculosis (TB)?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/23/the-road-to-ending-tuberculosis/">Tuberculosis</a> (TB) is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It primarily affects the <strong>lungs</strong> but can also affect other parts of the body.</p>
<p><strong>Status of TB in India and the world:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>As per the WHO Global TB Report 2022:</strong> India’s TB incidence for the year 2021 is <strong>210 per 100,000 population</strong> (a decline of over 18% from 2020)</li>
<li><strong>India has a large burden of the world’s TB,</strong> with an estimated economic cost of US$100 million lost annually due to this disease.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Need for new TB vaccines:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) (the only available TB vaccine):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Has <strong>reduced in efficacy over the years</strong> due to the development of multi-resistant TB</li>
<li>It has <strong>limited efficacy</strong> in preventing pulmonary TB disease in adolescents and adults</li>
<li>It does not prevent the <strong>reactivation of latent pulmonary infection</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, two vaccines <strong>VPM (Vaccine Projekt Management) 1002 and MIP (Mycobacterium Indicus Pranii)</strong> have been developed and identified for TB.</p>
<p><strong>WHO’s Draft Framework:</strong></p>
<p>It is in line with <strong>WHO’s End TB Strategy</strong> (to reduce TB incidence by 80%, TB deaths by 90%, and to eliminate costs for TB-affected households by 2030)</p>
<p><strong>Key Features of the Draft Framework for New TB Vaccines</strong></p>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/scientists-have-finally-filled-in-the-remaining-8-of-the-human-dna/article66724278.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> For the first time, <strong>the first complete end-to-end human genome</strong> has been published, as scientists have finally filled the gaps in the human genome that were previously <strong>too confusing to piece together</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>What is Genome?</strong></p>
<p>A genome is a genetic material that provides instructions for the development, growth, and functioning of all living organisms, composed of DNA with a sequence of chemical bases that determines an organism’s characteristics.</p>
<ul>
<li>German botanist <strong>Hans Winkler coined the word “genome” in 1920</strong>, combining the word “gene” with the suffix “-ome,” meaning “complete set,” to describe the full DNA sequence contained within each cell.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/science-technology/biotechnology/genome-sequencing/"><strong>Genome Sequencing</strong></a><strong>?</strong></p>
<p>It is the process of determining the complete DNA sequence of an organism’s genome. It involves identifying the order of nucleotides (A, T, C, G) that make up the DNA molecule in each of the chromosomes of an organism.</p>
<p><strong>An analogy to understand Genome:</strong> </p>
<p>The genome can be compared to <strong>a reference book</strong>. In this analogy, a genome contains the DNA– instructions for life. It’s composed of a vast array of nucleotides (<strong>letters</strong>) that are packaged into chromosomes (<strong>chapters</strong>). Each chromosome contains genes (<strong>paragraphs</strong>) that are regions of DNA which code for the specific proteins that allow an organism to function.</p>
<p><strong>What was the issue?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2018/01/06/insights-editorial-towards-genomics-revolution/">Human Genome Project</a> completed the first human genome in 2003. However, scientists weren’t actually able to <strong>put together all the genetic information</strong> in the genome. There were gaps: unfilled, often repetitive regions that were too confusing to piece together. With the advancement of technology, these gaps have been filled now.</p>

<td><strong>Number</strong></td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Non-Coding DNA</strong></td>
<td>The remaining 99% of non-coding DNA sequences that do not produce proteins</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Repetitive element</strong></td>
<td>Over 50% of the human genome is repetitive, with multiple copies of near-identical sequences</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>What is Repetitive DNA?</strong></p>
<p>It refers to sequences of DNA that are <strong>repeated multiple times within the genome of an organism</strong>. These repetitive sequences can be short, consisting of just a few nucleotides, or very long, containing hundreds or thousands of nucleotides.</p>
<p><strong>Usage: Some repetitive DNA sequences</strong> have been found to have important functions, such as regulating gene expression, maintaining the structure of chromosomes, and protecting against the insertion of foreign DNA. However, many repetitive sequences do not have a known function and are sometimes referred to as <strong>“junk DNA”.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is Satellite DNA?</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>simplest form of repetitive DNA is called satellites</strong>, which are blocks of <strong>DNA repeated over and over in tandem</strong>. Satellite DNA is found in <strong>telomeres</strong>, which are the protective ends of chromosomes, and in <strong>centromeres</strong>, which help keep genetic information intact during cell division.</p>
<p><strong>Usage</strong>: Researchers use satellite DNA as a genomic “<strong>fingerprint</strong>” to match crime scene samples and track ancestry.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> India’s ISRO and NASA are jointly developing a satellite called NISAR that will map the most earthquake-prone regions in the Himalayas with unprecedented regularity.</p>
<p><strong>How</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/science-technology/space-technology/nisar/"><strong>NISAR</strong></a> <strong>will map Himalayas’ seismic zones?</strong></p>
<p>The satellite will use <strong>two frequency bands</strong> to image the seismically active Himalayan region and <strong>every 12 days</strong>, create a <strong>“deformation map”</strong> to give advance warning of land subsidence and places that are at greatest risk from earthquakes.</p>
