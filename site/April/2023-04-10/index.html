<p><strong>Challenges faced by the scheme:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>High non-performing assets</strong> or bad loans</li>
<li><strong>Limited funds</strong> that cannot keep up with the pace of demand</li>
<li><strong>Regional disparitie</strong>s in the distribution of benefits</li>
<li><strong>Lack of financial literacy</strong> among beneficiaries leading to defaults</li>
<li><strong>Limited outreach</strong> to rural entrepreneurs</li>
<li><strong>Collateral requirements for loans above a certain amount</strong> make it difficult for many small enterprises to access credit</li>
<li><strong>Loan size limitations of up to Rs. 10 lakhs,</strong> which is inadequate for many small enterprises with higher capital requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Overall, the MUDRA scheme has been successful in providing credit to small entrepreneurs. However, it faces some significant challenges that need to be addressed to make it more effective and inclusive.</p>

<p><strong>The Indian private sector in the Second Space Age:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>From less than a dozen space <strong>start-ups</strong> five years ago, there are over 100 today.</li>
<li><strong>The pace of investment is growing</strong> (from $30 million in 2018, it doubled to $65 million in 2021).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Size of Indian space economy:</strong> Estimated to be about <strong>$10 billion in 2020 and expected to be $13 billion by 2025 (global space economy – from $450 to $600 billion between 2020-25).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Potential:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Much greater ~$60 billion by 2030.</li>
<li>The private sector is poised for take-off as a transformative <strong>growth multiplier</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How can this potential be achieved?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enabling policy and regulatory environment</strong>, <strong>directly creating over 2 lakh jobs</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>In terms of end-user revenue</strong>, media and entertainment account for 26% of India’s space economy, with consumer and retail services accounting for another 21%.<ul>
<li>The share generated by the government needs to be <strong>increased</strong> (from only a fifth now).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>In terms of space activities</strong>, the share of upstream activities needs to <strong>be increased.</strong><ul>
<li>Downstream activities are dominant – over 70% of India’s space economy.</li>
<li><strong>Upstream activities</strong> of satellite manufacturing and launch services contribute to the smaller share.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenge and opportunity:</strong> Regulation of the Indian private sector domain, which also provides a scope of expansion.</p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-3_3"><strong>GS Paper 3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Science and Technology – Developments and their Applications and Effects in Everyday Life</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/directing-ai-for-better-and-smarter-legislation/article66718048.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Most mature democracies are now using Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools for better pieces of legislation and parliamentary procedures.</p>
<p><strong>How AI tools can assist parliamentarians?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In preparing responses for legislators,</li>
<li>Enhancing research quality,</li>
<li>Obtaining information about any Bill, preparing briefs,</li>
<li>Providing information on particular House rules, legislative drafting, amendments, interventions, etc.</li>
<li>AI can also <strong>empower legislators</strong> to make informed decisions by having access to<ul>
<li>Insights into citizen grievances,</li>
<li>Media opinions, and</li>
<li>Voices of citizen-centric associations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In India,</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Parliamentarians manage <strong>large constituencies</strong>.</li>
<li>AI can analyse <strong>citizens’ grievances and social media responses, and flag issues and priorities</strong> that need immediate attention.</li>
<li>It can also assist parliamentarians in seeking <strong>citizen inputs for public consultation</strong> of laws and preparing a manifesto.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For AI to work in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First, laws need to be codified:</strong> The current laws are <strong>opaque, and complex</strong> and there is a huge <strong>translation gap</strong> between law-making, law-implementing and law-interpreting organisations.<ul>
<li>The Indian government has set up the <strong>India Code portal.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The interface should contain a complete chain:</strong> Right from the parent Act to the subordinate pieces of legislation enabling any entity to get a 360° view.<ul>
<li>This becomes more critical in special situations such as <strong>COVID-19</strong>. <strong>For example</strong>, the central government issued over 900 while State governments issued over 6,000 notifications.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How will this aid?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Can act as a single window platform. For example,</strong><ul>
<li>If an entrepreneur wants to open a manufacturing unit in Maharashtra, AI can tell what acts and compliances are applicable.</li>
<li>If a citizen wants to check the eligibility for welfare schemes, AI can recommend which schemes are eligible, based on details provided by citizens.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Can also simulate the potential effects of laws. For example,</strong> various datasets such as the Census, data on household consumption, and taxpayers, can be modelled.</li>
<li><strong>Can uncover potential outcomes of a policy.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Can flag outdated laws.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Global best practices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The House of Representatives in the US:</strong> Introduced an AI tool to automate the process of analysing differences between Bills, amendments and current laws.<ul>
<li>This is to <strong>readily see the impact of amendatory provisions</strong> in Bills that they move through the legislative process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Netherlands House of Representatives</strong>: “<strong>Speech2Write</strong>” system converts voice to text and “translates” voice into written reports.</li>
<li><strong>Japan’s AI tool:</strong> Assists in the preparation of responses for its legislature and also helps in the automatic selection of relevant highlights in parliamentary debates.</li>
<li><strong>Brazil:</strong> <strong>Ulysses system</strong> supports transparency and citizen participation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Initiatives in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The ‘One Nation, One Application’</li>
<li>The National e-Vidhan (NeVA) portal</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The use of AI must be encouraged in an <strong>open, transparent, and citizen-friendly</strong></li>
<li>To be mindful of the fact that <strong>AI is a means to an end and not an end in itself.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The COVID-19 pandemic has given a strong thrust to the Digital India initiative and the digitisation of services.</li>
<li>This momentum needs to be kept up and utilised in the field of law, and policy-making, by harnessing the power of AI.</li>

<p>Human composting, also known as <strong>natural organic reduction</strong>, is a process of transforming the <strong>human body into nutrient-rich soil</strong> that has emerged as an eco-friendly alternative to <strong>traditional burial or cremation</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Process</strong>: The process involves <strong>washing and dressing the body</strong> in a biodegradable gown, placing it in a closed vessel along with selected materials, and leaving it to decompose for 30 days with the addition of oxygen to speed up the process.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: The resulting soil can be used <strong>for gardening or spread in designated memorial</strong> grounds or forest conservation areas. Human composting costs around $5,500, and is <strong>much less energy-intensive than cremation.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Opposition</strong>: The Catholic Church has been the biggest opponent of the process, calling it an “unfortunate spiritual, emotional, and psychological distancing from the deceased.”</p>
<p><strong>Usage</strong>: The example can be cited as an <strong>alternative way of lifestyle</strong> (even after death) which promotes environmental sustainability</p>

<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi praised the innovative waste management system at <strong>Bowenpally Vegetable Market in Hyderabad</strong> during one of his Mann Ki Baat episodes. The market’s vegetable waste is now being turned into <strong>bioelectricity, biofuel and bio-manure, generating nearly 500 units of electricity</strong> and 30 kg of <strong>biofuel</strong> daily.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: Waste management of about <strong>7-8 tons of vegetable waste</strong> generated to produce 400 units of electricity on average. The biogas unit <strong>helps reduce the electricity bill by half</strong> and the liquid bio manure is being used as <strong>fertilizer in the farmers’ fields.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Prime Minister Narendra Modi attended the 125th-anniversary celebration of Sri Ramakrishna Math at Vivekananda House in Chennai, Tamil Nadu.</p>
<p><strong>About</strong> <strong>Ramakrishna Math</strong></p>
<p>Ramakrishna Math is the <strong>administrative legal organization of the Ramakrishna Order</strong>, considered part of the Hindu reform movements. It was set up by sannyasin disciples of Ramakrishna Paramhansa headed by Swami Vivekananda at various places in India. Ramakrishna Math in various sectors such as <strong>education, libraries, health care, nursing, rural development, and leprosy awareness</strong> and rehabilitation.</p>
<p><strong>About Ramakrishna Paramahansa (1836 –1886)</strong></p>
<p>He was an Indian <strong>Hindu mystic and spiritual leader</strong> who practised <strong>various religious traditions, including Hinduism, Islam, and Christianity</strong>, and proclaimed that all religions are different paths leading to the same goal. His followers regarded him as <strong>an avatar or divine incarnation, and his teachings</strong> were later popularized by his disciple Swami Vivekananda.

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Union Cabinet has changed the <strong>pricing regime for domestic natural gas</strong> under the ambit of the administered price mechanism (APM)</p>
<p><strong>About APM:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>APM applies to the pricing of gas produced by legacy fields (old Oil fields awarded to ONGC and OIL before 1999, when auctioning started)</li>
<li>APM gas accounts for <strong>about two-thirds of India’s natural gas production</strong>,</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Drugmakers have been given an <strong>extension until August 1st</strong> to implement the Track and Trace system for the export of pharmaceutical consignments.</p>
<ul>
<li>The extension was granted due to <strong>difficulties faced by members of the pharma exporter body Pharmexcil</strong> in joining the system.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About the system:</strong></p>
<p>The system was designed to <strong>address counterfeit and product recall issues</strong> and has been in the works for <strong>eight years</strong>. It is based on <strong>traceability and barcodes on the packaging</strong>, which can help identify the source and prevent sabotage. The system covers secondary and tertiary packaging initially, with primary packaging to be included at a later stage.</p>
<p><strong>Status of India in Pharmacy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>India’s pharmaceutical exports rose <strong>more than 3% to about $25 billion (FY23)</strong> but have missed the $27 billion target.</li>
<li>India produces about <strong>60 per cent of global vaccines and 70 per cent</strong> of the World Health Organisation’s vaccines for essential immunisation schemes.</li>
<li>India is the <strong>world’s third-largest pharmaceutical producer</strong> and is considered a <strong>‘pharmacy to the world’</strong>.</li>
<li>It is the <strong>largest provider of generic drugs</strong></li>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.livemint.com/economy/india-is-well-within-its-right-to-ensure-quality-11680893545064.html"><strong>LM</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> India has been issuing <strong>quality control orders (QCO)</strong> for products of mass consumption, including machinery safety equipment, pressure cookers, toys and air conditioners, <strong>to curb Chinese imports and boost exports</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, several WTO members have objected to this move and say that India’s QCOs are protectionist and may not be compliant with the WTO’s <strong>Agreement on Technical Barriers</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are QCOs?</strong></p>
<p>The main aim of the QCO is to <strong>control the import of sub-quality and cheaper items and to ensure that customers</strong> get quality products. QCOs <strong>cannot</strong> be challenged at WTO if they are imposed on grounds of health, safety, environment and deceptive trade practice, or national security. BIS certifies it for International and domestic products.</p>
<p><strong>India’s stand:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All orders are in line with WTO norms</li>
<li>India has the <strong>right to impose QCOs</strong> since they are first applied in the domestic market and then on imports.</li>
<li>India’s rationale behind issuing QCOs is to <strong>curb the dumping of cheap products from China</strong> and to address the widening trade deficit, which is nearly 40% of the total deficit.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade:</strong></p>
<p>It provides regulations on technical standards including packaging, labelling requirements, and environmental quality standards to be kept during the trade. <strong>As per the WTO’s agreement</strong>, members <strong>shall not adopt unnecessary obstacles</strong> to international trade.</p>

<p>A genome is a <strong>genetic material that provides instructions</strong> for the development, growth, and functioning of all living organisms, composed of DNA with a sequence of chemical bases that determines an organism’s characteristics.</p>
<p><strong>What is Genome Sequencing?</strong></p>
<p>Genome sequencing is the process of determining the complete DNA sequence of an organism’s genome. It involves identifying the order of nucleotides (A, T, C, G) that make up the DNA molecule in each of the chromosomes of an organism.</p>
