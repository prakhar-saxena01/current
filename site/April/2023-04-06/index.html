<h4 id="gs-paper-2"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Indian Constitution—Historical Underpinnings, Evolution, Features, Amendments, Significant Provisions and Basic Structure</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/supreme-court-lifts-telecast-ban-on-media-one-says-critical-views-on-government-policies-not-anti-establishment/article66701560.ece#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20critical%20views%20about%20government,functioning%20of%20the%20democratic%20republic."><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The SC set aside the Centre’s order refusing to grant the renewal of the broadcast licence to a Malayalam news channel (Media One).</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting <strong>refused to renew the broadcast licence</strong> of the news channel on the ground that the <strong>Ministry of Home Affairs</strong> had declined (based on IB report) <strong>security clearance</strong> over alleged links with the Jamaat-e-Islami-Hind (JEIH).</li>
<li>The channel approached the <strong>Kerala HC</strong> against the Centre’s action, which had upheld the ban on the channel on the grounds of <strong>national security.</strong><ul>
<li>The government is at liberty to decline to renew the permission granted <strong>without disclosing complete reasons for the non-renewal.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The SC set aside the Kerala HC order</strong> and directed that the licence be renewed in four weeks’ time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What the channel’s promoters contended in the SC?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>They were not given a chance to <strong>defend themselves</strong> as the national security reasons were submitted to the HC in a <strong>sealed cover</strong> (in the public interest).</li>
<li>The fundamental right to <strong>freedom of speech and expression</strong> [Article 19(1)(a)], which includes <strong>press</strong> freedom, can be restricted under <strong>Article 19(2)</strong> and there was no allegation that the channel violated the Program Code.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reasonable restrictions</strong></p>
<p>These are outlined in <strong>Article 19(2) of the Constitution</strong> allowing for restrictions (on freedom of speech and expression) in the interests of the</p>
<p>●       Security and sovereignty of India,</p>
<p>●       Friendly relations with Foreign States,</p>
<p>●       Public order,</p>
<p>●       Decency or morality in the relation to contempt of court,</p>
<p>●       Defamation or incitement to an offence.</p>
<p><strong>What did the SC say?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The top court was <strong>critical of the sealed cover procedure</strong> adopted in the HC and the “<strong>cavalier manner</strong>” in which the Centre raised the claim of national security.</li>
<li>Opinions that are critical of government policies are not anti-establishment.</li>
<li>It would be <strong>impracticable and unwise for the courts to define</strong> the phrase national security.</li>
<li><strong>National security claims cannot be made out of thin air</strong> and there must be material backing such inference.</li>
<li><strong>National security</strong> is being used as a tool by the government to deny people legal recourse → not compatible with the <strong>rule of law</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>JEIH is not a banned organisation</strong> and it is unclear how links with the organisation would affect the <strong>sovereignty and integrity</strong>, <strong>security of the state</strong>, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Issues between the two countries:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Border Dispute</strong>: Disputes over the exact demarcation of the border between the two countries.</li>
<li><strong>Hydropower Projects:</strong> Concerns in Bhutan over environmental and social impacts from the project. Also, Bhutan has sought <strong>greater revenue from these projects</strong></li>
<li><strong>Trade Imbalance:</strong> Bhutan is heavily dependent on India for its imports.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-Border Movement:</strong> Bhutan has restricted the cross-border movement of Indian workers, citing concerns over the impact on Bhutan’s culture and society.</li>
<li><strong>Political Interference:</strong> Bhutan has accused India of interfering in its internal affairs, particularly during the 2013 elections.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>India-Bhutan relations have remained strong and friendly, characterized by a deep sense of trust and understanding.  Both countries must enhance connectivity which is a <strong>central pillar of India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ and ‘Act East’ policies.</strong></p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-3_1"><strong>GS Paper 3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Agriculture and Issues of Food Security</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/open-source-seeds-movement-plant-breeding-climate-resilience/article66702112.ece#:~:text=The%20OSSI%20simply%20asks%20for,these%20seeds%20or%20their%20derivatives%E2%80%9D."><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Inspired by the success of open-source software, a Canadian plant breeder suggested (in 1999) a similar approach to seeds.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> The advent of hybrid seeds, the growth of the commercial seed industry, scientific plant breeding, etc., conferred plant breeders and developers of new varieties with the <strong>plant breeders’ rights (PBRs)/plant variety rights (PVRs).</strong></p>
<p><strong>How is intellectual property (IP) protected in agriculture?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There are now two forms of IPR protection in agriculture: <strong>PBRs and patents</strong>.<ul>
<li>PBRs <strong>give the breeder exclusive control over the propagating material</strong> (including seed) and harvested material of a new variety of plants for a number of years, <strong>preventing the unauthorised use</strong> of seeds to develop new varieties.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Together, they <strong>restrict farmers’ rights and the freedom to develop new varieties</strong> using germplasm from IP-protected varieties.</li>
<li>They have consolidated the seed sector by increasing the number of plant varieties covered by IP Rights (IPRs).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Evolution of PBRs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/04/25/sansad-tv-milestones-series-green-revolution/">Green Revolution</a> was spearheaded by public-sector breeding institutions and seeds were available as <strong>reasonably priced hybrids with no restrictions</strong> on farmers to cultivate, reuse and share.</li>
<li>But the private sector led the genetic revolution in agriculture, with seeds mostly made available as hybrids/protected by strong IPRs.</li>
<li>The <strong>WTO’s Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs)</strong> requires member states to provide protection for plant varieties either by patents/by an effective standalone system.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Problems triggered by IP protection:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The private sector began to dominate the seed sector.</li>
<li>The <strong>high prices of genetically modified</strong> (GM) seeds.</li>
<li>The State’s Intervention on Bt cotton Seeds in India.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Alternative – Open-source seeds:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It simply asks for a pledge, that an individual won’t “restrict others’ use of seeds or their derivatives by patents or other means.</li>
<li><strong>Open-Source Seeds Initiative in India:</strong> The Hyderabad-based Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (CSA), part of the <strong>Apna Beej Network</strong>, developed a model with the help of <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/02/28/farmers-producer-organisations/">farmer-producer organisations (FPOs).</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Potential application of the open-source approach:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To use it in <strong>farmer-led seed conservation</strong> (of traditional varieties) <strong>and distribution systems</strong>.</li>
<li>To promote <strong>farmer-led participatory</strong> plant-breeding exercises as traditional varieties often lack <strong>uniformity and quality.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges faced by India:</strong> Extreme temperatures or rain triggered by <strong>climate change</strong> has caused a decline in the quality and size of seeds across India.</p>
<p><strong>Way ahead for India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Under the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/12/27/protection-of-plant-varieties-and-farmers-rights-authority-ppvfr/">Plant Variety Protection and Farmers’ Rights Act (PPVFRA) 2001</a>, farmers can register varieties as ‘farmer varieties’ if they meet certain conditions, and have the right to reuse, replant and exchange seeds.<ul>
<li>However, they can’t breed and trade in varieties protected under the Act for commercial purposes.</li>
<li>Using the open-source approach here will <strong>enable farmers to gain more rights over germplasm and seeds and facilitate innovation</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Open-source principles can facilitate testing, improvisation and adoption – all of which will ultimately be beneficial to <strong>India’s food security and climate-disease resilience.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Environment, Conservation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/trading-forests-for-trees-8540990/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The government introduced <strong>The Forest (Conservation), Amendment Bill, 2023</strong> in Lok Sabha to make changes to <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/environment-degradation-and-issues/forest-ecosystem/forest-policy-and-laws-for-forest-conservation/the-forest-conservation-act-1980/#:~:text=Enacted%20to%20check%20the%20indiscriminate,prescribing%20the%20punishment%20for%20violations.&amp;text=Working%20plans%20should%20be%20up,have%20a%20multi%2Ddimensional%20approach.">The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Following independence, vast swathes of forest land were designated as <strong>reserved and protected forests</strong> and brought under state forest departments.</li>
<li><strong>Many forested areas were left out</strong> and <strong>areas without any standing forests were included</strong> in ‘forest’ lands.<ul>
<li>According to the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/01/14/state-of-forest-report-2021/#:~:text=The%20total%20tree%2Dand%2Dforest,geographical%20area%20of%20the%20country.">State of Forests Report (SFR 2021</a>), nearly <strong>28%/</strong>197,159 sq km (of India’s recorded forest cover – 713,789 sq km) is not recorded as ‘forest’.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The anomalies were supposed to be <strong>sorted out through extensive ground surveys</strong> but the process remained incomplete.</li>
<li><strong>In 1996, the SC</strong> suspended the felling of trees across the country and ruled that the FC Act would apply to all land parcels that were <strong>either recorded/resembled forest</strong>.</li>
<li>This sweeping order helped <strong>check rampant deforestation</strong> but prevented the exclusion of vast areas already used for agriculture/homesteads.</li>
<li>The 2023 Bill <strong>seeks to limit the applicability of the FC Act</strong> only to land recorded as ‘forest’.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The predominant idea of the proposed changes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To build forest <strong>carbon stock</strong> by raising plantations.</li>
<li>To make land available for developers to meet their legal obligation towards <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/06/unused-funds-unsuitable-land-the-problems-with-compensatory-afforestation-in-india/">compensatory afforestation</a> in lieu of forest land diverted for development projects.</li>
<li>To achieve both these objectives by<ul>
<li>Restricting the applicability of the FC Act, and</li>
<li>Freeing up land that is currently locked up as unrecorded forests.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Concerns:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If the scope of the FC Act is restricted, <strong>fewer projects will be required to obtain forest clearance</strong> → <strong>affecting compensatory afforestation</strong>.<ul>
<li>Conservationists see this as a <strong>double whammy</strong> → losing unrecorded forests to plantations → diverting recorded forests for projects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The proposed exemptions leave a lot to the Centre to decide <strong>retrospectively</strong>.</li>
<li>Though the Bill keeps up with dynamic changes in the ecology, strategic and economic aspirations, and improvement in the livelihoods of tribals/forest dwellers, it boils down to <strong>pushing plantations to achieve carbon neutrality</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Forests are a lot more than a sum of trees. Unlike man-made plantations, natural forests perform a range of ecosystem services that are key to the survival and well-being of millions of species.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> A new study has revealed that <strong>an alien invasive plant</strong> is <strong>threatening to pulverise native vegetation across 21 islands</strong> in the Gulf of Mannar Biosphere Reserve (GoMBR).</p>
<p><strong>What is causing threat to the islands:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prosopis chilensis</strong>, a <strong>drought-resistant plant native</strong> to the arid region of South American countries</li>
<li>The <strong>coral reef has been destroyed in several places</strong> near these islands although coral quarrying for industrial purposes has been outlawed.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The fish – a type of <strong>snailfish</strong> – was filmed at a depth of <strong>8,336m in the Izu-Ogasawara Trench</strong>, south of Japan, using a robotic ‘lander’ submarine.</p>
<p><strong>About Snailfish:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Snailfish</strong> belong to the family of marine ray-finned fishes.</li>
<li><strong>of species:</strong> over 300 species of snailfish in the world and most of them can be found swimming in shallow rivers.</li>
<li><strong>In extreme conditions:</strong> Some snailfish have adapted to live in the freezing cold waters of the Arctic and Antarctic, and in the extreme pressure conditions in the world’s deepest underwater trenches.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How do they survive under such immense pressure?</strong></p>
<p>These deepwater snailfish have <strong>squishy, gelatinous bodies</strong>, which help them to survive the crushing pressure. They <strong>don’t have a swim bladder</strong> – an organ found in most fish which controls their ability to float. In terms of food, these fish are like little vacuum cleaners, that suck up scraps and tiny crabs on the ocean floor.</p>
