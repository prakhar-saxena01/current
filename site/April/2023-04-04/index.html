<p><strong>Context:</strong> The <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/08/06/what-is-defamation/#:~:text=Defamation%20is%20the%20communication%20of,government%2C%20religion%2C%20or%20nation.">defamation law</a> in India has come under scrutiny once again following the conviction of a Congress leader (Rahul Gandhi) in a 2019 defamation case.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> In <strong>1860</strong>, the British imported their idea of criminal defamation into the newly-minted <strong>Section 499</strong> of the <strong>Indian Penal Code (IPC)</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>The law of defamation and right to free speech [Article 19 (1)(a)]:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exceptions</strong> to defamation: <strong>Absolute truth and what is for the public good.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The criminality of defamation</strong> was challenged in the SC on the grounds that it was an <strong>unreasonable restriction</strong> on the constitutionally-guaranteed <strong>right to freedom of speech and expression.</strong></li>
<li>However, <strong>the apex court upheld the British-era Section</strong> (<strong>Subramanian Swamy V. The Union of India 2016).</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Analysing the 2016 SC verdict:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Article 21 vs 19 (1)(a):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The court held that <strong>the right to “reputation”</strong> was protected under <strong>Article 21</strong> of the Constitution which guarantees “life and personal liberty”.</li>
<li>The right under Article 19(1)(a) <strong>had to be “balanced” against the right to “reputation”</strong> under Article 21.</li>
<li>Thus, the <strong>court elevated “reputation”</strong> to the level of a <strong>fundamental right</strong> and made it <strong>prevail over free speech</strong>.</li>
<li>Over the years, the court has expanded the scope of Article 21 <strong>to force the state to undertake various “social justice” measures.</strong></li>
<li>But in this case, the <strong>SC used Article 21 as a sword to cut down the fundamental right</strong> to freedom of speech and expression (“death by Article 21”).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Invoking ‘constitutional fraternity’:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The court held that <strong>criminal defamation law protected the feeling of fraternity</strong> (mentioned in the preamble as an aspirational goal alongside “liberty” and “equality”)/<strong>solidarity</strong> between members of society.</li>
<li>However, “constitutional fraternity” is <strong>not a part of Article 19(2)</strong>, which specifically limits the circumstances under which the state can restrict speech.</li>
<li><strong>“Liberty cannot be divorced from equality; equality cannot be divorced from liberty. Nor can liberty and equality be divorced from fraternity.” (B.R. Ambedkar)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Issues with the court’s verdict:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No mention of the fact that Section 499 does not allow for “<strong>honest mistake</strong>” as a defence.<ul>
<li>The SC (previously) had found the <strong>civil law of defamation unconstitutional/disproportionate</strong> restriction upon free speech since it did not allow for “honest mistake”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Dismissal</strong> of the claim that criminal defamation creates a <strong>chilling effect upon speech</strong>.</li>
<li>The SC has always had an <strong>ambivalent relationship</strong> with the freedom of speech and expression.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The court had to construct novel arguments which will have serious and unfortunate implications for the freedom of speech and expression in the coming years.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Over the course of the next four days, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of RBI will deliberate whether interest rates should be hiked further or not.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IRB.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IRB.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Since May last year, <strong>RBI has been raising the repo rate</strong> (the rate at which the RBI lends to the banking system) → banks/other financial institutions charge higher interest rates → <strong>existing EMIs</strong> for home/car/business loans have been going up.</p>

<tr>
<td><strong>Pros</strong></td>
<td><strong>Cons</strong></td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Contain inflation:</strong> Higher EMI would dissuade enough people from borrowing money to fund future economic activity → slowdown in demand for money → bring down inflation → “too much money chasing too few goods”.</td>
<td>●       Hike per se cannot improve the supply of those goods and services<br><br>●       Prevent the “<strong>second-order effects</strong>” of high inflation → refer to a spike in people’s expectation of future inflation<br><br>●       <strong>Limit India’s economic expansion and make unemployment worse</strong><br><br>●       A contractionary/tighter monetary policy (higher interest rates) increases <strong>inequality</strong> in an economy</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Does bringing interest rates down reduce inequalities?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>From the 2008 Global Financial Crisis until the war between Russia and Ukraine, most central banks practised an <strong>expansionary/loose</strong> monetary policy → low-interest rates → flooding the economy with additional money → spurring economic activity.</li>
<li>But, there was growing criticism that <strong>low-interest rates were leading to higher wealth inequalities</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Here’s how</strong>: When interest rates are low → <strong>savers barely get any rewards</strong> (save-you-lose) → most of the wealth creation happens in the stock markets → <strong>stocks are mostly owned by the rich</strong> (invest-you-win).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What should be done given the harmful effects of both (contractionary/expansionary) monetary policies on inequality?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Widening inequalities is a very long-term trend, which <strong>depends on deep structural changes in any economy</strong> such as globalisation, technological progress, demographic trends etc.</li>
<li><strong>A properly managed monetary policy</strong> promotes greater economic stability and prosperity for the economy as a whole, by<ul>
<li>Mitigating the effects of recessions on the labour market and</li>
<li>Keeping inflation low and stable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is the need to rely on <strong>fiscal policy</strong> (taxes and government spending programs) and policies aimed at improving workers’ skills <strong>to address distributional concerns.</strong></li>

<p><strong>Challenges faced by project tiger:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Poaching:</strong> Project Tiger’s efforts were mainly hampered by poaching, also by the debacles and irregularities in Sariska and Namdapha.<ul>
<li>As per NTCA, 1059 tiger deaths were in the last 10 years, most in Madhya Pradesh</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Conflict with FRA, 2006:</strong> The <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/02/11/forest-rights-act/">Forest Rights Act</a> passed by the Indian government in 2006 recognizes the rights of some forest-dwelling communities in forest areas.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of adequate protection</strong> in the <strong>outside tiger reserve.</strong><ul>
<li>According to a report, nearly <strong>29 per cent</strong> of tigers lives outside of the core zone</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Man-Animal Conflicts</strong> Wildlife habitats are shrinking leading to more instances of human-animal conflict.<ul>
<li>From 2001 to 2016, 1,065 cases of human-tiger conflict were recorded including injuries and even fatalities on both sides.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The tiger is a unique animal which plays a pivotal role in the health and diversity of an ecosystem.  However, there is a need for further community involvement through a tiger reserve that is not built with fences and armed patrol guards, but around a <strong>cultural model of conservation</strong> i.e. including local tribes <strong>like Idu Mishmi in Arunachal Pradesh, who consider Tigers as their elder brother and sacred.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Election Commission of India has chosen <strong>not to take a stance on whether a disqualified lawmaker should be banned from contesting elections for five years</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The issue:</strong></p>
<p>A petition has been filed in SC that an MP or an MLA who has <strong>either been disqualified from the House under the</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/06/17/10th-schedule-of-the-constitution-5/#:~:text=The%20Tenth%20Schedule%20was%20inserted,other%20member%20of%20the%20House."><strong>Tenth Schedule (anti-defection law)</strong></a> <strong>or under Article 191(1)(e)</strong> of the Constitution should be barred from contesting elections for five years. This is to <strong>discourage MP/MLAs from switching</strong> the political party to gain political favour.</p>
<p><strong>About the article:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Article 191(1)(e)</strong> gives the <strong>various grounds of disqualification</strong> “for being chosen as, and for being a member of the Legislative Assembly or Legislative Council of a State” on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Holding an office of profit</li>
<li>Being of unsound mind or undischarged solvent</li>
<li>Being a non-citizen or voluntarily acquiring the citizenship of a foreign state</li>
<li>Being under any acknowledgement of allegiance or adherence to a foreign state.</li>
<li>If an MLA or an MLC is “disqualified by or under any law made by Parliament”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ECI argument:</strong> The issue falls under the interpretation of <strong>Article 191(1)(e) of the Constitution</strong>, and it would be appropriate for the Union government to deal with it. The commission’s mandate is limited to the conduct of elections in terms of the <strong>remit of Article 324 of the Constitutio</strong>n.</p>

<li>They will extract ice in a <strong>series of tubes from as far as 125 metres (137 yards) below the surface</strong>, containing <strong>frozen geochemical traces dating back three centuries</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why preserve ancient ice?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Analysis of chemicals in deep “ice cores” provides scientists with <strong>valuable data about past environmental conditions.</strong></li>
<li>Studies indicate that the <strong>Arctic is warming between two and four times faster than the global average.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How will it be preserved?</strong></p>
<p>One set of ice tubes will be used for <strong>immediate analysis</strong> while a second set will be <strong>sent to Antarctica for storage in an “ice memory sanctuary” under the snow</strong>, where the samples will be preserved for future generations of scientists.</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: Astronomers have discovered one of the biggest black holes ever found, <strong>using</strong> <a href="https://hubblesite.org/contents/articles/gravitational-lensing">gravitational lensing.</a></p>
<p><strong>About Gravitational Lensing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Gravitational lensing is the name given to the <strong>phenomenon where a foreground object</strong>—a galaxy or a black hole—<strong>bends the light from a more distant object behind it, magnifying it in the process.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How was the discovery made?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The researchers <strong>used supercomputer simulations</strong> that <strong>simulated light from a faraway galaxy</strong> travelling through the Universe <strong>hundreds of thousands of times</strong>. Each of the <strong>simulations had a black hole of a different mass, changing the light’s journey to Earth.</strong></li>
<li>When the researchers included an ultra-massive black hole in one of the simulations, the path taken by the light exactly matched the path seen in actual images captured by the Hubble Space Telescope.</li>
<li>This helped them discover <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/chandra/news/ultra_black_holes.html">the ultra-massive black hole</a><strong>, over 30 billion times the mass of our Sun, in the foreground galaxy.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This new approach taken by the researchers could make it possible to <strong>study inactive black holes in distant galaxies, which is not currently possible with other existing techniques.</strong></p>
