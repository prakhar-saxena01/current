<h4 id="gs-paper-1_1"><strong>GS Paper 1</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Population related issues</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/india-as-most-populous-can-be-more-boon-than-bane/article66770664.ece#:~:text=Looking%20at%20the%20population%20composition,to%20reap%20an%20economic%20dividend."><strong>TH</strong></a> </p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> According to the UNFPA State of World Population (SOWP) Report 2023, China is projected to hand over the baton of the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/07/decoding-indias-population-conundrum/#:~:text=India's%20population%20stands%20at%20412,from%201%2C412.6%20million%20in%202021">most populous country to India</a>.) by mid-2023.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights of the UN report:</strong> India will have a population of <strong>142.86 crores by mid-2023</strong>, which is 2.9 million higher than China’s population of 142.57 crores.</p>
<p><strong>Is it a dividend or a disaster for India?</strong> To answer this, there is a need to understand the –</p>
<p><strong>Nature of population growth, size:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Population is a resource</strong> as long as the country’s carrying capacity is intact.</li>
<li><strong>Carrying capacity</strong> is not just per capita availability of natural resources, it is a <strong>dynamic concept</strong> that changes according to changing technology, and the efficiency of the production and consumption systems of a country.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Case of India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>With a total fertility rate of <strong>2.</strong><strong>0 in 2023</strong>, India is already at <strong>replacement level fertility</strong>, meaning two children replacing their parents.</li>
<li>This indicates that the population is on a path toward <strong>stabilisation –</strong> experiencing positive growth (in a decelerated mode) until 2064 and then will become <strong>negative growth</strong>.</li>
<li>The peak of India’s population size will be around <strong>169.</strong><strong>6 crore in 2063.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Age composition of the population:</strong> It talks about the <strong>number of the working age population</strong> (15-64 years) against the <strong>dependent population</strong> (0-14 years and 65 years and above).</p>
<p><strong>Case of India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There are greater prospects for <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Reaping-Indias-demographic-dividend.pdf">demographic dividend</a> than a disaster.</li>
<li><strong>With 68%</strong> of the working age population in 2023, the country continues to have a <strong>demographic window of opportunity for the next 35 years</strong> to reap an economic dividend.</li>
<li>A demographic window of opportunity <strong>in itself will not automatically turn into an economic dividend</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mechanisms through which a country translates demographic bonus into economic dividend:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Employment or job creation</strong>: If India is able to generate sufficient and quality jobs for its bulging working age population.</li>
<li><strong>Education, skills generation and ensuring a healthy lifespan</strong>: It is critical not only for better productivity but it also reduces excessive public spending and helps in greater capital creation.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/governance/governance-important-aspects/good-governance/"><strong>Good governance</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Reflected through conscientious policies, it will help in creating a healthy environment for increasing efficiency and productivity of the population.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Opportunities for India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Declining and ageing population</strong> in Japan, China, the US and other major economies.<ul>
<li>Potential to become <strong>a worldwide market for both production and consumption</strong>, with lower manufacturing costs due to a relatively cheaper workforce.</li>
<li>This is very much evident in <strong>India’s IT sector.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Potential to boost per capita GDP</strong> by an additional <strong>43% by 2061</strong>, provided the socio-economic and political enabling environment is conducive.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drastic population control methods</strong> run the risk of inducing forced population ageing.<ul>
<li><strong>A</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/09/17/the-consequences-of-declining-fertility-are-many/#:~:text=India%3A,is%202.159%20births%20per%20woman"><strong>total fertility rate of less</strong></a> <strong>than 8</strong> may not be <strong>economically beneficial</strong> for India. Once fertility tends to decline, it is hard to reverse it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What the country needs are <strong>policies</strong> that support an enabling environment that can provide high-quality education, healthcare, employment, infrastructure, and gender empowerment.<ul>
<li>If India falls short in this, its “<a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/08/12/sansad-tv-the-global-debate-demographic-imbalance/">demographic dividend</a>” can become a “demographic disaster”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Opportunities and costs are the <strong>two sides of the coin</strong> when it comes to being the world’s largest populous country. However, the relatively younger population of India provides <strong>higher support ratios.</strong></p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-2"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Government policies and interventions for development in various sectors and issues arising out of their design and implementation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/a-new-troika-for-indias-northeast-region/article66770821.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The region comprising <strong>India’s</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/08/16/editorial-analysis-the-fragility-of-the-northeasts-integration/"><strong>eight north-eastern States</strong></a> is undergoing dramatic change.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/north_east.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/north_east.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Dramatic changes witnessed by the region:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It has overcome several (but not all) <strong>security challenges</strong> and is now heading toward <strong>economic development</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Political changes</strong> and the <strong>extensive web of linkages with neighbouring Bangladesh</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Japan</strong> has emerged as a significant development partner for both India (particularly in the NE region) and Bangladesh.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Opportunity:</strong> Bringing the <strong>troika</strong> of Bangladesh, India and Japan closer for producing path-breaking changes in the northeast.</p>
<p><strong>Vision:</strong> The long-term vision is for Bangladesh and the northeast to become <strong>a hub and key industrial corridor of this region</strong>, serving a population of 220 million.</p>
<p><strong>Efforts made to realise this vision:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The third India-Japan Intellectual Dialogue</strong> hosted by the Asian Confluence (ASCON), in Agartala, Tripura, assessed the evolving thinking of experts and policymakers.</li>
<li><strong>The Matarbari Deep Sea Port</strong> (DSP) on the southeastern coast of Bangladesh is being constructed with Japanese assistance.<ul>
<li>To be operational in 2027, <strong>the port will have to cater to the needs of Bangladesh and India’s northeast</strong> and one of the most important projects representing the troika<strong>.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The competitive advantage of the NE region:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Blessed with <strong>vast natural resources.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Its strategic location</strong>, sharing borders with Nepal, Bhutan, China, Bangladesh and Myanmar, is an asset.</li>
<li><strong>The population</strong>, with its good education, already excels in the services sector drawing potential investor attention.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The challenges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Japan as a single investor</strong> in the northeast is unworkable.</li>
<li>Restrictions on the flow of investments from Bangladesh.</li>
<li>Little attention seems to be paid to the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/06/08/insights-editorial-analysis-a-silver-moment-to-propel-a-bay-of-bengal-dream/"><strong>BIMSTEC</strong>.</a> This must change to progress towards the vision of establishing the <strong>Bay of Bengal Community (BOBC).</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A joint focus on comprehensive connectivity and accelerating industrialisation</strong> in Bangladesh and the NE is accompanied by <strong>job opportunities.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The creation of regional industrial value chains</strong> in the sectors where the NE enjoys competitive advantage (agro-processing, man-made fibres, handicrafts, etc) will ensure that the <strong>new connectivity links will be fully utilised and productive.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Expanding policy convergence</strong> and taking people along.</li>
<li>The goal should be to connect a large part of <strong>South Asia with Southeast Asia.</strong></li>
<li>Also, India can assist Bangladesh in becoming an integral part of the <strong>Act East Policy</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The leadership from the triad of Bangladesh, India and Japan (BIJ) can come together and launch a BIJ Forum at the level of Foreign Ministers first.</p>
