<p><strong>Context:</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/10/07/parliamentary-committees-their-leaders-and-their-role-in-law-making/">Parliamentary committees</a> – panels made up of MPs – are constituted to delve deeper into matters of public concern and develop an expert opinion.</p>

<td><strong>Parliamentary committees in India</strong></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Meaning</strong></td>
<td>A committee appointed/elected by the House or nominated by the Speaker of Lok Sabha (LS) or the Chairman of Rajya Sabha (RS) and has a secretariat provided by the LS/RS.<br><br>They work under the direction of the Speaker/Chairman, presenting their report to the House or to the Speaker/Chairman.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Evolution</strong></td>
<td><strong>Individual committees</strong> have been formed since independence (Ex. The Ad Hoc Committee on the Citizenship Clause). A structured committee system was established in <strong>1993</strong>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Legal/ constitutional backing</strong></td>
<td>Mentioned in the Constitution of India without providing specific provisions (regarding their composition, tenure, functions, etc).<br><br>These matters are dealt with by the <strong>rules of two Houses</strong>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Need</strong></td>
<td>Indian Parliament undertakes <strong>a large volume of information and scale of operations</strong> → not feasible to take up all issues on the floor of the House.<br><br>Continuous efforts are needed to make Parliament a <strong>dynamic, functional space</strong>.<br><br>Thus, committees are constituted to make <strong>Parliament a dynamic space and take up sector-specific concerns.</strong><br><br>Behind every comment and every Bill introduced or taken up for discussion lies the <strong>ceaseless work</strong> of various committees.<br><br>‘It is not far from the truth to say that Congress in session is Congress on public exhibition, whilst Congress in Committee rooms is Congress at work’ (<strong>Woodrow Wilson</strong>)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Classification</strong></td>
<td><strong>Standing Committees</strong> are permanent in nature, constituted every year or periodically. They may be further classified (based on the nature of the function) –<br><br>Financial Committees (Public Accounts Committee, etc)<br><br>Departmental-related Parliamentary Standing Committees<br><br>Committees to Inquire such as the Committee on Petitions, etc<br><br><strong>Ad Hoc Committees</strong> are temporary (need-based).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Role</strong></td>
<td><strong>Go into the details of a specific piece of legislation</strong> → analyse its potential impact on governance indicators →  then make their recommendations (not binding on the government).<br><br><strong>Go into issues that are crucial for nation-building</strong> but don’t hold as much political significance. Take the example of defence shipyards.<br><br><strong>Ensure an oversight on the executive</strong> → The government is required to table an ‘Action Taken’ report for the House to judge the progress made on the suggestions of the committee.<br><br><strong>Enable day-to-day functioning of Parliament in session:</strong> For example, the Business Advisory Committee prepares the entire schedule of both Houses when Parliament is in session.<br><br><strong>Enable efficient functioning of MPs:</strong> For example, the Committee on papers laid on the table of the House <strong>prepares each individual paper</strong> after careful deliberation, writing and screening.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Best practice</strong></td>
<td>Work done on the <strong>Digital Data Protection Bill</strong> (The Puttaswamy judgement (2017) → Justice Srikrishna Committee → The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 → A Joint Parliamentary Committee → New Draft Digital Data Protection Bill, 2022)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Current challenges</strong></td>
<td>Political enmity and polarization<br><br>Public proceedings of the House <strong>do not allow for any deliberation, leaving the consensus</strong><br><br><strong>The declining trend</strong> of national legislation being subjected to expert scrutiny.<br><br>During the course of the 17th LS, <strong>only 14 Bills have been referred for the further examination so far</strong>.<br><br>25% of the Bills introduced were referred to committees in the 16th LS, as compared to 71% and 60% in the 15th and 14th LS respectively.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>The road ahead</strong></td>
<td>The Parliament could consider <strong>a compulsory referral</strong> (like the US) for the Bills that are tabled on the floor.<br><br><strong>Arming these toothless tigers with more powers</strong> to help them ensure accountability from the executive.<br><br>It is essential for the parliamentary ecosystem in India <strong>to institutionalise such procedures</strong> and not allow political considerations to hasten law-making.</td>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has released its <strong>annual report on the illicit trafficking of nuclear and other radioactive material (part of the</strong> Incident and Trafficking Database), stating that radioactive materials and contaminated devices are entering into the <strong>scraps recycling chain</strong>, posing a severe health hazard.</p>
<p><strong>What is Radioactive contamination?</strong></p>
<p>Radioactive contamination occurs when radioactive substances, such as particles or radiation, are deposited onto surfaces, objects, or people. E.g., <strong>Radioactive-laced waste products</strong> are often found <strong>while scrapping ships</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>The institutional mechanism in India against Radioactive Contamination:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Atomic Energy Act, 1962:</strong> It provides a regulatory framework for all activities related to atomic energy and the use of ionizing radiation.</li>
<li><strong>Atomic Energy Regulatory Board</strong> to exercise regulatory and safety functions.</li>
<li><strong>Atomic Energy Rules, 2004 and 2012</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Additional Information:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Tests for Radioactive elements:</strong></p>
<p>Radioactivity in drinking water can be determined by a <strong>gross alpha test</strong>. Radioactivity is measured in <strong>Becquerel (SI unit) or in Curie</strong>. The unit <strong>Sievert</strong> measures the quantity of radiation absorbed by human tissues.</p>

<tr>
<td><strong>The rationale behind the proposed law</strong></td>
<td>Armed forces personnel are governed by the <strong>provisions of three separate laws for the three services</strong> –<br><br>the Air Force Act, 1950,<br><br>the Army Act, of 1950, and<br><br>the Navy Act, 1957<br><br><strong>Only an officer of the same service</strong> (not the commander-in-chief of a joint services command/the officer-in-command of any other inter-services organisation) holds disciplinary powers over persons governed by the respective Act → <strong>impacts command, control and discipline</strong>.<br><br>The existing framework is <strong>time-consuming and involves financial costs</strong> to move the personnel → <strong>impedes expeditious disposal of cases.</strong><br><br>The proposed legislation aims to address these impediments <strong>without disturbing the unique service conditions or amending the service Acts.</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Key provisions in the Bill</strong></td>
<td>Existing inter-services organisations will be deemed to have been constituted under the Bill.<br><br>The proposed legislation <strong>seeks to empower the central government</strong> to set up an inter-services organisation by notification.<br><br>This can include <strong>a joint services command – a key feature of the theaterisation plan</strong> of the armed forces. <strong>The commander-in-chief or the officer-in-command</strong> will be the head.<br><br><strong>The superintendence</strong> of the inter-services organisation will be vested in the <strong>Central Government.</strong><br><br><strong>All disciplinary and administrative powers</strong> in terms of personnel (continue to be governed by their respective service Acts) will lie with the commander-in-chief, the officer-in-command, etc.<br><br>The Centre <strong>can notify any force or part of it</strong>, under the authority of the Government, to which the Bill will apply.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Tangible benefits</strong></td>
<td><strong>Expeditious disposal of cases</strong>, saving time and public money by <strong>avoiding multiple proceedings</strong> and <strong>greater integration</strong> amongst armed forces personnel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>How will it affect the tri-services theaterisation plan?</strong></td>
<td>Each of the theatre commands will have units of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force.<br><br>All the units will work as <strong>a single entity looking after security challenges</strong> in a specified geographical territory under an operational commander.<br><br>The Bill holds the potential to ensure <strong>better management of theatre commands</strong> once they are operationalised.</td>

<p><strong>Context</strong><strong>:</strong> Astronomers have discovered a repeating radio signal from YZ Ceti b, a rocky, Earth-sized exoplanet rotating around a small red dwarf star only 12 light-years away from Earth.</p>
<p><strong>Significance</strong>: This discovery suggests the presence of a <strong>magnetic field around the planet</strong>, which is one of the prerequisites for a habitable planet.</p>
<p><strong>What is a Radio signal from</strong> <a href="https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/what-is-an-exoplanet/overview/#:~:text=An%20exoplanet%20is%20any%20planet,Overview"><strong>Exo-Planets</strong></a><strong>?</strong></p>
<p>Radio signals from planets are <strong>electromagnetic waves</strong> that are emitted naturally by planets in the radio frequency range. <strong>The intensity and frequency</strong> of the radio signals vary depending on the planet, its magnetic field, its atmosphere, and other factors.</p>
<p><strong>How Ceti b produce a radio signal?</strong></p>
<p>The radio signals detected from <strong>YZ Ceti b</strong> are a result of the interaction between the <strong>planet’s magnetic field</strong> and the star, and such signals can only be produced if the exoplanet <strong>orbits very close to its parent star</strong> and has its own magnetic field to influence the stellar wind and generate the signals.</p>
<p><strong>What is Exoplanet?</strong></p>
<p>An exoplanet, also known as an extrasolar planet, is a planet that orbits a star other than our sun.</p>

<p><strong>About Red Dwarf Stars</strong>:</p>
<p>Red dwarf stars are <strong>small, low-mass, dim, and cool stars</strong>, they are the most common and smallest in the universe. As red dwarfs are <strong>dimmer than other stars</strong>, it is easier to find exoplanets that surround them. Also, the <strong>habitable zone of red dwarf stars</strong> is closer to the star than stars like our sun, making it easier to observe potentially habitable planets</p>
