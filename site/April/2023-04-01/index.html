<h4 id="gs-paper-13"><strong>GS Paper 1/3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Salient features of the World’s Physical Geography/ Conservation, Environmental Pollution and Degradation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/rising-antarctic-ice-melt-ocean-flows-8528801/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> According to a new study, an alarming effect on the global temperature, the marine food chain and the stability of ice shelves is being caused by the <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/ice-sheets/">Antarctic ice sheet’s rapid melting</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/world-geography/physical-geography-of-the-world/oceanography/currents/"><strong>Ocean currents</strong></a> are the continuous, predictable, directional movement of seawater driven by gravity, wind (Coriolis Effect), and water density.</li>
<li>These <strong>overturning circulation/currents</strong>, driven by the movement of denser water towards the sea floor, helps deliver heat, carbon, oxygen and vital nutrients (rise up from the bottom) around the globe.</li>
<li>They <strong>have been relatively stable for thousands of years</strong>, but they are now being disrupted by the <strong>warming climate.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Findings of the study:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>With temperatures rising</strong> → freshwater from Antarctica’s melting ice enters the ocean → reducing the salinity and density of the surface water → diminishing downward flow to the sea’s bottom.</li>
<li>Deepwater circulation in the Antarctic could weaken (<strong>by 40% by 2050</strong>) <strong>at twice the rate of decline in the North Atlantic.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The effect of meltwater on global ocean circulation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disrupts the base of the food chain:</strong> As the Southern Ocean supports about three-quarters of global phytoplankton production → <strong>impacts the marine ecosystem</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Leaving more CO2 in the atmosphere:</strong> The ocean would not be able to absorb as much CO2 as its u<strong>pper layers become more stratified</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>AUKUS:</strong> US, Australia and UK announced the 3-phase plan – a $368 Billion deal to provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines over the next 30 years.</li>
<li><strong>Japanese PM’s visit to Delhi</strong>: Japanese PM unveiled <strong>Japan’s new Indo-Pacific Policy</strong> and indicated that Japan stands against both Russia and China’s military plans.</li>
<li><strong>US hosted a virtual Democracy Summit</strong>: Pitching a front of democracies vs authoritarian states – deepening the global divide as<ul>

<li>They called the Ukraine War – <strong>an assault on democracy.</strong></li>

<p><strong>Challenges for India:</strong> India is a common factor on both sides – <strong>therefore it has to walk a tough tightrope</strong> between its</p>

<li><strong>Maritime strategy</strong> (Quad, UK, France, Germany, EU, IOR countries- Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Mauritius, etc).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There is a reason that India’s current foreign policy (where there is a Quad, SCO, G-7, and G-20) of strategic autonomy and multipolarity is not so different from its traditional foreign policy of non-alignment.</li>
<li>Instead of seeing non-alignment as a compulsion, <strong>there is merit in seeing India’s traditional balancing act</strong> as one that gives its foreign policy maximum flexibility to serve India’s needs.</li>

<tr>
<td><strong>Process Re-Engineering and Automation</strong></td>
<td>The new policy focuses on <strong>export promotion and development through automated IT systems</strong> for various approvals, making it easier for MSMEs and others to access export benefits.</td>
<td>It will also encourage MSMEs to participate in the global market.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Towns of Export Excellence</strong></td>
<td>Four new towns (Faridabad, Mirzapur, Moradabad, and Varanasi) have been designated as <strong>Towns of Export Excellence (TEE) in addition to the existing 39 towns.</strong> The TEEs will have priority <strong>access to export promotion funds under the MAI scheme.</strong></td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Recognition of Exporters</strong></td>
<td>Exporter firms recognized with <strong>‘status’</strong> (e.g. 2-star, 4-star, 5-star ratings) based on export performance will now help in <strong>skilling and training</strong> (similar to the <strong>‘each one teach one’</strong> initiative)</td>
<td>This will help India build a <strong>skilled manpower pool</strong> capable of servicing a <strong>$5 Trillion economy before 2030</strong>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Promoting export from the districts</strong></td>
<td>The FTP aims at building partnerships with State governments and taking forward the <strong>Districts as Export Hubs (DEH) initiative</strong> to promote exports at the district level and accelerate the development of the grassroots trade ecosystem.</td>
<td>It will help in <strong>identifying and promoting local products</strong> and services.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Streamlining SCOMET Policy</strong></td>
<td>India is placing more emphasis on the <strong>“export control” regime</strong> to comply with the international treaties and agreements entered into by India.<br><br><strong>SCOMET: “</strong>Special Chemicals, Organism, Materials, Equipment and Technologies” items are <strong>dual-use items</strong> having the potential for both civilian applications as well as weapons of mass destruction.</td>
<td>A robust export control system in India would provide <strong>access to dual-use High-end goods and technologies</strong> to Indian exporters while facilitating exports of controlled items/technologies under SCOMET from India.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Facilitating E-Commerce Exports</strong></td>
<td>The FTP 2023 outlines the intent and roadmap for <strong>establishing e-commerce hubs and related elements</strong> such as payment reconciliation, bookkeeping, returns policy, and export entitlements.</td>
<td>It will help Indian exporters tap into the potential of e-commerce exports and increase their global reach.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Facilitation under the Export Promotion of Capital Goods (EPCG) Scheme</strong></td>
<td>The EPCG Scheme, which allows the <strong>import of capital goods at zero Customs duty</strong> for export production, is being further rationalized.<br><br>Additional schemes such as the <strong>PM MITRA scheme</strong> have been added to claim benefits under the Common Service Provider scheme.<br><br><strong>Battery Electric Vehicles</strong>, Vertical Farming equipment, Wastewater Treatment and Recycling, Rainwater harvesting systems, and Green Hydrogen are added to <strong>Green Technology products</strong> – will now be eligible for <strong>reduced Export Obligation requirements</strong> under EPCG Scheme</td>
<td>It will <strong>promote domestic manufacturing and encourage investment in capital goods</strong>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Facilitation under the Advance authorization Scheme (AAS)</strong></td>
<td>AAS provides <strong>duty-free import of raw materials</strong> for manufacturing export items.<br><br>It has been now <strong>extended to the export of the Apparel</strong> and Clothing sector</td>
<td>It will promote domestic manufacturing and encourage investment in the textile sector.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Merchanting trade</strong></td>
<td><strong>Merchanting trade</strong> involves the shipment of goods <strong>from one foreign country to another foreign country</strong> without touching Indian ports, involving an Indian intermediary.<br><br>Merchanting trade of <strong>restricted and prohibited items</strong> under the export policy would now be possible.</td>
<td>It will help convert financial centres such as <strong>GIFT city</strong> etc. into major merchanting hubs as seen in places like Dubai, Singapore and Hong Kong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Amnesty Scheme</strong></td>
<td>Similar to the <strong>“<em>Vivaad se Vishwaas</em>“</strong> initiative, the government has introduced a <strong>special one-time Amnesty Scheme</strong> under which Exporters who have been unable to meet their obligations under EPCG and Advance Authorizations can be regularised on <strong>payment of all customs duties exempted</strong> in proportion to unfulfilled export obligations.<br><br>The interest payable is <strong>capped at 100% of these exempted duties</strong> under this scheme.</td>
<td>It will help in <strong>reducing litigation and fostering trust-based relationships</strong> to help alleviate the issues faced by exporters.</td>

<p><strong>About the Previous Trade policy: The Foreign Trade Policy 2015-20</strong></p>
<p>It merged various schemes into a <strong>single Merchandise Export from India Scheme (MEIS)</strong> and simplified the <strong>nomenclature of Export Houses</strong>. The policy also introduced incentives for <strong>Special Economic Zones and recognized successful business</strong> leaders as <strong>Status Holders</strong>. A new chapter on <strong>Quality Complaints and Trade Disputes</strong> was incorporated to resolve trade disputes between exporters and importers. The mid-term review of the policy increased the scope <strong>of MEIS and SEIS and extended the validity of Duty Credit Scrips</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: The parliamentary standing committee on heavy industry highlighted <strong>that Phase 2 of the</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/welfare-schemes/schemes-under-ministry-of-heavy-industries/fame-india-scheme/"><strong>FAME scheme</strong></a> <strong>to subsidize electric vehicles has achieved only 51.96 per cent of its target</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>In related news, the <strong>Committee on Estimates (2022-23)</strong> for the evaluation of electric vehicle policy under the <strong>Union Ministry of Heavy Industries suggested an extension of the FAME II scheme.</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Issues highlighted in the committee report</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Massive dependence on oil imports and Internal Combustion Engine (ICE</strong>) vehicles causes air <strong>pollution and greenhouse gases</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Slothy progress</strong> in both physical and financial targets.</li>
<li><strong>EV charging stations are sanctioned only for a few cities</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Suggestions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Boost charging infrastructure</strong>.</li>
<li>The scheme should be extended further <strong>with new targets, incentives, and measures</strong>.</li>
<li>Place greater <strong>emphasis on implementation and extend the subsidy to private vehicles</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lessons from China:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>China’s experience <strong>with promoting electric vehicles (EVs) by offering generous subsidies in 2009,</strong> became costly for the government due <strong>to the large price differential and a number of buyers</strong>.</li>
<li>So, it <strong>phased out subsidies in 2020 and imposed a mandate on car manufacturers to ensure a certain percentage of all vehicles sold each year are battery-powered</strong>.</li>
<li>To avoid <strong>financial penalties, manufacturers must earn a stipulated number of points based on range, energy efficiency, and performance.</strong></li>
<li>An academic paper published recently suggested that the <strong>phase-out policy is the most cost-effective approach to promote EV sales compared to other policies that provide larger subsidies over more extended periods.</strong></li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The <strong>Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board</strong> has implemented the Unified Tariff, a long-awaited reform in the natural gas sector.</p>
<p><strong>What is a Unified Tariff?</strong></p>
<p>The Unified Tariff is a <strong>way to calculate the price of transporting natural gas</strong> across different pipelines in India. This helps to ensure that the <strong>cost of transporting gas is fair and consistent across the country.</strong></p>
<p><strong>About Unified Tariff:</strong></p>
<p><strong>PNGRB</strong> (the regulator) has <strong>notified a levelized unified tariff of ₹73.93 per metric million British thermal units (MMBTU)</strong> and created three tariff zones for unified tariff:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First zone</strong> is up to a distance of 300 km from the gas source</li>
<li><strong>Second zone</strong> is 300 – 1200 km</li>
<li><strong>Third zone</strong> is beyond 1200 km</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance</strong>: The Unified Tariff is expected to assist in <strong>achieving the ‘One Nation One Grid One Tariff’ model</strong> and stimulate gas markets in remote areas.</p>
<p><strong>The Ministry of Petroleum &amp; Natural Gas</strong> <strong>bi-annually revises</strong> the price of natural gas produced from various sources</p>
<p><strong>About One Nation, One Gas Grid:</strong></p>
<p>One Nation, One Gas Grid refers to the integration of the regional grids thus establishing a National Grid for providing energy produced by natural gas to various stakeholders.</p>
<p>At present, there are about <strong>17,000 km long Natural Gas pipeline network</strong>, with an additional over 15000 km of pipelines to be completed under the National Gas Grid</p>
<p><strong>About Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board</strong></p>
<p>Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) is a <strong>statutory body</strong>, constituted under <strong>Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board Act, 2006.</strong> Its primary functions include regulation of refining, transportation, distribution, storage, marketing, supply and sale of petroleum products and natural gas.</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: Indian Institute of Science (IISc) researchers have designed a <strong>novel ultra-micro supercapacitor, a tiny device capable of storing an enormous amount of electric charge.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Apart from <strong>being small in size and more compact</strong> than existing supercapacitors, they can potentially be used in many devices ranging from <strong>streetlights to consumer electronics, electric cars and medical devices.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Supercapacitors, combine the best of both batteries and capacitors</strong> – they can <strong>store as well as release large amounts of energy and are therefore highly sought-after for next-generation electronic devices.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Current capacitors</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>They typically use metal oxide-based electrodes</strong>, but they are limited by poor electron mobility.</li>
<li>In the future, the <strong>researchers are planning to explore if replacing MoS2 with other materials can increase the capacitance of their supercapacitor even more.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/iit-mandis-novel-catalyst-offers-to-make-hydrogen-more-viable-as-fuel/article66674950.ece"><strong>The Hindu</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: Researchers at <strong>IIT Mandi have developed a novel carbon-based catalyst</strong> to <strong>make water electrolysis more efficient.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Water electrolysis is the <strong>process of choice to produce ‘green hydrogen</strong> ‘thus making it more significant.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About water electrolysis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In water electrolysis, <strong>water molecules are split into hydrogen and oxygen using electricity</strong> inside a device called an <strong>electrolyser</strong>. However, this process <strong>consumes a lot of electrical energy.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>New finding:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A new study has <strong>reported a porous carbon material containing nitrogen</strong> that <strong>functions both as a catalyst and as the anode in electrolyser units – and could substitute the metal-based catalysts.</strong></li>
<li>The researchers produced this material, <strong>called ‘laser carbon’, by exposing a sheet of a polymer called polyimide to a laser beam</strong>, which carbonised the <strong>exposed bits, leaving the remainder rich in nitrogen.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advantages of the new catalyst:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Laser carbon is “<strong>highly power efficient”, cheaper to produce, has a simpler synthesis technique, and “can be batch-manufactured with a laser”.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Source: Indian Express</strong></p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: A team led by experts at Tel Aviv University has shown <strong>tomato and tobacco plants, among others, not only make sounds but do so loudly enough for other creatures to hear.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Plants have <strong>evolved complex biochemical responses and the ability to dynamically</strong> alter their growth (and regrow body parts) in <strong>response to environmental signals including light, gravity, temperature, touch, and volatile chemicals produced by surrounding organisms</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>More about the research:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In 2019, researchers showed the <strong>buzzing of bees can cause plants to produce sweeter nectar</strong>. Others have shown white <strong>noise played to Arabidopsis, a flowering plant in the mustard family, can trigger a drought response.</strong></li>
<li>Researchers recorded airborne sounds produced by tomato and tobacco plants, and five other species (grapevine, henbit deadnettle, pincushion cactus, maize and wheat). These <strong>sounds were ultrasonic, in the range of 20-100 kilohertz, and therefore can’t be detected by human ears.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What causes these sounds?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The team’s findings suggest that “<strong>cavitation” may be at least partially responsible for the sounds</strong>.</li>
<li>Cavitation is the <strong>process through which air bubbles expand and burst inside a plant’s water-conducting tissue, or “xylem”.</strong></li>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: NASA’s Dragonfly mission to <strong>explore Titan is scheduled for launch in 2027, and the spacecraft is expected to arrive at its destination in around 2034.</strong></p>
<p><strong>About Titan:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Titan is the <strong>second largest moon (Saturn’s) in our solar system</strong> (<strong>after Jupiter’s Ganymede</strong>).</li>
<li>It is <strong>larger than Mercury and has lakes, rivers, clouds, and rain of methane on the surface.</strong></li>
<li>Titan’s building blocks are <strong>expected to be similar to those on the earth before life took root</strong>. While both the earth’s and Titan’s atmospheres contain abundant nitrogen, <strong>Titan lacks oxygen.</strong></li>
<li>The presence of <strong>methane and nitrogen in Titan’s atmosphere could allow their component atoms – carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen –</strong> to potentially exist and recombine to form a rich variety of organic compounds.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>Dragonfly mission is part of NASA’s ‘New Frontiers’ programme</strong>, which also includes the New Horizons mission to Pluto and the Kuiper Belt; Juno to Jupiter; and OSIRIS-REx to the asteroid Bennu.</p>
