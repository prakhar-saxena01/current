<p><strong>Context:</strong> The US President is to visit Belfast, the capital of Northern Ireland, to mark the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/diff.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/diff.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What is the Good Friday Agreement?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Signed on April 10, <strong>1998</strong>, between factions of <strong>Northern Ireland and the governments of Britain and Ireland</strong>, to end 30 years of the violence known as ‘<strong>The Troubles</strong>’ in Northern Ireland.</li>
<li>The Agreement has been hailed as <strong>a model deal to end long-standing conflicts</strong> and fetched a joint <strong>Nobel peace prize</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What were ‘The Troubles’?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Northern Ireland</strong> was created in <strong>1921</strong> and in <strong>1922</strong> the rest of Ireland gained independence from the British (the today’s Republic of Ireland, with its capital in Dublin).</li>
<li><strong>Northern Ireland remained with the UK</strong>, but tensions simmered between those who wished to remain with the UK (<strong>Protestants</strong>) and those who wanted to join Ireland (<strong>Catholics</strong>).</li>
<li><strong>By the 1960s,</strong> the Protestants had become more powerful and the Catholics started facing <strong>discrimination</strong>.</li>
<li>The violence erupted between both factions – The Troubles, <strong>claiming the lives of more than 3,500 people.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Terms of the Good Friday Agreement:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Northern Ireland would continue to be a part of the UK.</strong></li>
<li><strong>It could join Ireland if a majority of voters</strong> on both sides supported it in a <strong>referendum</strong>.</li>
<li>People born in Northern Ireland could have <strong>Irish or British nationality or both.</strong></li>
<li>Northern Ireland would get a <strong>new government</strong>, which would have powers over <strong>local matters</strong>, while the UK government would look after <strong>security, foreign policy, tax laws, immigration rules, etc.</strong></li>
<li><strong>On May 22 1998</strong>, a referendum was held in Ireland and Northern Ireland, and the agreement was approved by 94% of voters in Ireland and 71% in Northern Ireland.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the status 25 years on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The most important achievement of the Agreement has been <strong>an end to bloodshed and enduring peace in the region</strong>.</li>
<li>However, <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/10/26/editorial-analysisbrexit-britains-challenges-remain/"><strong>Brexit</strong></a> has created an obstacle <strong>paralysing the agreement for more than a year.</strong></li>
<li>This is because <strong>Northern Ireland shares a land border with an EU country</strong> – Ireland. As the <strong>EU and the UK have different product standards</strong>, checks would be necessary for sending goods from Northern Ireland to Ireland.</li>
<li>Britain’s intelligence agency (MI5), recently increased the threat level in Northern Ireland from <strong>domestic terrorism to “severe”.</strong></li>
<li>Several pro-Union political parties in N. Ireland (like the DUP) <strong>started boycotting the agreement.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steps taken to solve this crisis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Checks would be conducted between <strong>Great Britain</strong> <strong>and Northern Ireland.</strong></li>
<li>The UK and the EU reached an agreement known as the <strong>Windsor Framework – which</strong> seeks to address the aforementioned disruptions to trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why is the US so enthusiastic about the Agreement?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The US had played a key part in negotiations building up to the agreement.</li>
<li>The USA’s current President (Biden) is descended from <strong>Irish immigrants</strong> (second after John F Kennedy) and is vocally proud of his Irish heritage.</li>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: The Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly has passed a resolution urging the Union Government and President to <strong>issue instructions to Governor R.N. Ravi</strong> to give his assent to bills passed by the Assembly (nearly 20 bills are pending) within a specific period.</p>
<p><strong>Constitutional provisions regarding bills sent to the governor:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/26/editorial-analysis-constitutional-silences-unconstitutional-inaction/"><strong>Article 200</strong></a>: When a bill is sent to Governor after it is passed by the state legislature, he can <strong>give his assent to the bill, Withhold his assent</strong>, or <strong>Return the bill</strong> (if it is not a money bill) for reconsideration of the state legislature. However, if the bill is passed again with or without amendments, the governor has to give his assent or reserve the bill for consideration by the President</p>

<p><strong>Initiatives by India towards the militarisation of space</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In 2019, India concluded the <strong>first</strong> table-top joint war game called ‘<strong>IndSpaceEx’</strong> – run by the military and space scientists.</li>
<li>Demonstration of India’s <strong>Anti-Satellite (ASAT) capability</strong> under <strong>Mission Shakti.</strong></li>
<li>Establishment of the new tri-service <strong>Defence Space Agency (DSA)</strong> – tasked with operating the space-warfare and Satellite Intelligence assets of India.</li>
<li><strong>Mission DefSpace</strong> was launched in 2022 for the development of innovative solutions in the space domain by the industry.</li>
<li><strong>Indian DefSpace Symposium</strong>, organised by the Indian Space Association (ISpA) and the DRDO under Mission DefSpace, to create a platform for all stakeholders who have a keen interest in boosting India’s military space capability and plans.</li>
<li><strong>Indian Space Association (ISpA)</strong> is a voluntary association of leading space industries established with the objective of providing advisory and advocacy support to the space industry in India.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The need to explore the field of <strong>miniaturisation of satellites and reusable launch platforms</strong> to mitigate cost challenges and accelerate the pace of augmenting India’s space-based capabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Enhancing space situational awareness capability</strong> to safeguard assets with counter space capabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Building resilience</strong> and redundancy in a space-based infrastructure.</li>
<li>Working very closely with i<strong>ndustry as well as academia</strong> right from the development stage.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Space is the future for all action and capabilities – <strong>the real force multiplier.</strong> Therefore, the time to invest more and prepare is now.</li>
<li><strong>“Victory smiles upon those who anticipate the changes in the character of war, not upon those who wait to adapt themselves after the changes occur.”</strong></li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> After the Parliamentary Standing Committee (PSC) pointed out <strong>‘zero insurance coverage’</strong> of livestock in 2022-23, the central government is considering a comprehensive <strong>livestock insurance scheme</strong> modelling the <strong>Prime Minister’s Fasal Bima Yojana</strong>.</p>

<li><strong>The proposed Comprehensive livestock insurance</strong> will replace the present Livestock Insurance Scheme (LIS)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Status</strong>:</p>
<p>Less than <strong>1% of the country’s cattle population</strong> is currently insured, with the average yearly premium at <strong>4.5</strong>% of the insured amount.</p>
<p><strong>The proposal:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Waive off premiums for cattle rearers</strong> from Scheduled Caste-Scheduled Tribe communities</li>
<li><strong>Reduce premiums</strong> so that more farmers can enrol in the scheme</li>
<li><strong>Ensure maximum coverage of livestock</strong> to protect them from pandemics such as lumpy skin disease.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Supreme Court has called for a “<strong>uniform national policy</strong>” to ensure <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/05/31/insights-into-editorial-disability-and-the-barriers-to-feminine-hygiene/">menstrual hygiene</a> for girls in schools.</p>
<p><strong>What is menstrual hygiene?</strong></p>
<p>Menstrual hygiene <strong>refers to the practices and conditions</strong> that help maintain menstrual health and well-being. It includes using clean and safe menstrual products, washing and changing them regularly, having access to clean water and sanitation facilities, and managing menstrual pain and discomfort.</p>
<p><strong>SC directive:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The policy should include provisions for <strong>sanitary pads, disposal mechanisms, and exclusive washrooms</strong> for girls.</li>
<li>SC emphasized <strong>the importance of sanitation and menstrual hygiene</strong> in government-aided and residential schools</li>
<li>It called on <strong>States and Union Territories to submit menstrual hygiene</strong> plans within four weeks.</li>
