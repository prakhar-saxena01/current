<h4 id="gs-paper-1"><strong>GS Paper 1</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Indian Culture – Salient Aspects of Art Forms, Literature and Architecture from Ancient to modern times</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/climate-change/harappa-rakhigarhi-dholavira-200-years-of-droughts-may-have-erased-these-indus-megacities-says-study-88990"><strong>DTE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> A recent study found that <strong>severe droughts</strong> during the Bronze Age may have wiped off the population of the Indus Valley people, endorsing the theory that climate change led to the collapse of ancient civilisation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/ancient-indian-history/harappan-indus-valley-civilization/"><strong>Indus Valley Civilisation</strong></a> <strong>(IVC):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It was a <strong>Bronze Age civilisation</strong> in the <strong>northwestern regions</strong> of South Asia, lasting from <strong>3300 BCE to 1300 BCE</strong>.</li>
<li>It is also known as the <strong>Harappan Civilisation</strong>, after Harappa (now in Pakistan) – the <strong>first of its sites</strong> to be excavated early in the 20th century.</li>
<li>It stretches over an area spanning northeast <strong>Afghanistan</strong>, much of <strong>Pakistan</strong> and western and northwestern <strong>India</strong>.</li>
<li>It thrived in the <strong>Indus River basins</strong> and along a network of rivers that originally flowed near the ephemeral <strong>Ghaggar-Hakra river</strong> in northwest India and eastern Pakistan.</li>
<li>The civilisation is noted for its <strong>urban planning</strong>, baked brick houses, elaborate drainage and water supply systems, handicraft techniques (carnelian products, seal carving) and metallurgy (copper, bronze, lead and tin).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important sites:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Decline: Climate change</strong> → weaker monsoons → reduced water supply →  gradual drying of the soil →  scattering of population eastward and southward.</p>
<p><strong>Findings of the new study</strong> (by the University of Cambridge)<strong>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Droughts</strong> that began 4,200 years ago gripped the civilisation and <strong>went on for over two centuries.</strong></li>
<li>The protracted droughts <strong>severely affected food systems and habitation patterns</strong> → forcing the people of the IVC to make <strong>systemic changes to adapt</strong> → a more self-reliant lifestyle.</li>
<li><strong>They reorganised their large cities</strong> and moved towards the east of the region in <strong>smaller rural settlements</strong>.</li>
<li>They also had to make changes to their <strong>agricultural practices</strong> → relying more on drought-resilient crops such as millet.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How did the study arrive at its conclusions?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The scientists studied the layers of a <strong>stalagmite</strong> – the vertical mass of mineral deposits rising from the floor of caves and caused by water dripping – to assess relative seasonal rainfall.</li>
<li>They also used <strong>high-precision Uranium-series dating</strong> to assess the duration of the droughts.</li>

<h4 id="gs-paper-2"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus</strong><strong>: Multilateral Organization</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/exercise-of-veto-in-unsc-driven-by-political-considerations-and-not-by-moral-obligations-india/article66784711.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> India has stated that the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/04/20/veto-power-of-unsc-permanent-members/"><strong>veto power in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC)</strong></a> is driven by political considerations and not by moral obligations</p>
<p><strong>What is Veto Power?</strong></p>
<p>Veto power is a <strong>special power given to the permanent members</strong> of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), namely China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Essentially, it gives these countries the <strong>ability to reject or veto any action by the UNSC</strong> that does not align with their national interests or foreign policy objectives.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the United Nations Security Council, decisions are made <strong>with a majority of 9 votes of the 15 Council members’ votes</strong>. All decision is rejected if one of the five permanent members of the Security Council <strong>makes use of its veto</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Need for Veto Power:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It prevents the UNSC <strong>from making hasty or poorly thought-out decisions</strong> that could have negative consequences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The UN veto has in some ways <strong>saved the UN</strong> as it gives <strong>teeth to P5 nations</strong>. The <strong>League of Nations</strong> failed because <strong>it didn’t have the power</strong> to implement its initiatives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Veto power <strong>gives the P5 members a sense of security</strong> in knowing that their interests will not be overridden by the other members.</p>
</li>

<tr>
<td><strong>Veto immobilizes the ability of the UNSC to act</strong></td>
<td>Recently, <strong>Russia has vetoed several resolutions</strong> that would have put sanctions on it for <strong>violating Ukraine’s sovereignty</strong>, independence, unity, and territorial integrity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>“Sovereign equality” is violated</strong></td>
<td>The fact that only five countries have veto powers goes against the idea of sovereign equality of states, perpetuating a Second World War mindset of <strong>“to the victor belong the spoils”.</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Political considerations over moral obligations</strong></td>
<td>The US has used its veto <strong>power over 80 times</strong>, often for political considerations, rather than moral obligations. For example, in 1972, the <strong>US vetoed a resolution that called for an end to its bombing of North Vietnam</strong>, despite widespread condemnation and protests.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Veto has rendered the UNSC passive to certain pressing issues</strong></td>
<td>The UNSC stayed silent during major international conflicts, including the 2003 Iraq War, the 2008 conflict in Georgia, and the 2009 deaths of Sri Lankan Tamils.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Lack of accountability</strong></td>
<td>In 2017, Russia vetoed a resolution that would have <strong>condemned the use of chemical weapons in Syria</strong>, despite substantial evidence of their use by the Syrian government.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Critics opine the veto power is anachronistic, unjust, or counterproductive</strong></td>
<td>The veto power is seen as a disproportionate power and an impediment to credible international action in crises.</td>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> </p>
<p>It’s important for <strong>P5 and other UN members to balance the Veto Issue</strong> and make the Council more <strong>representative and democratically accountable</strong>, based on earlier experiences with the League of Nations.</p>
<p><strong>About UN Charter:</strong></p>
<p>The UN Charter is the <strong>foundational treaty of the United Nations, signed in 1945</strong> and in force since the same year. Its main objective is to <strong>maintain international peace and security</strong>, <strong>promote social progress and better standards of life</strong>, strengthen international law, and promote human rights. <strong>All members of the UN</strong> are bound by its articles</p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-3"><strong>GS Paper 3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Indigenization of Technology and Developing New Technology/Energy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/should-india-consider-phasing-out-nuclear-power/article66785072.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> There are doubts about whether nuclear power, with its associated concerns about cost and safety, remains a viable choice for India as solar and wind power gain popularity globally.</p>
<p><strong>Global outlook for nuclear power:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In Europe and the U.S.</strong>, nuclear power is seeing an <strong>upsurge</strong>, particularly after the Ukraine war.</li>
<li><strong>The U.K.</strong> is scaling up nuclear power to <strong>decarbonise the electricity</strong></li>
<li><strong>Germany</strong> has shut down the last of its nuclear power plants, while <strong>France</strong> (the nuclear powerhouse of the world) is struggling to replace its ageing reactors.</li>
<li><strong>China and South Korea</strong> have committed to increasing the share of nuclear power in the country’s energy mix (to 30% by 2030 in S. Korea).</li>
<li><strong>Japan</strong> is restarting the shutdown of reactors after the Fukushima (accident) because it was otherwise dependent either on expensive imported coal/natural gas (LNG).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advantages of nuclear power:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is a <strong>low-carbon power.</strong><ul>
<li>A nuclear plant operating 1,000 MW at 90% PLF (plant load factor) <strong>requires only 25 tonnes of low-enriched</strong> (below 5% proportion of fissile uranium) uranium fuel per year.</li>
<li>A coal plant (of similar capacity) requires <strong>~5 million tonnes of coal</strong> and coal produces <strong>ash</strong> containing many heavy metals detrimental to the water source.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Firm and dispatchable power</strong>. <strong>Firm power</strong> is the power that can be sent to the electric grid to be supplied whenever needed.</li>
<li>Low operating cost, job-intensive.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> High capital cost, low safety/prone to accidents, concerns over nuclear proliferation, not renewable energy, radioactive waste generation, etc.</p>
<p><strong>India’s nuclear plan:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/nuclear.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/nuclear.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Nuclear power is <strong>only 2.5%-3.2% of India’s installed and generated power</strong> and is premised on working around its limited supply of enriched uranium.</li>
<li>This is expected to increase to <strong>22.5 GW by 2031 from 6.9 GW now.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/science-technology/nuclear-technology/nuclear-energy-in-india/"><strong>does India need more nuclear power</strong></a><strong>?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Very limited growth potential for hydropower</strong> because of conserving biodiversity, the costs of rehabilitating and compensating landowners and the <strong>seismological factors in the Himalayas</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>India has nearly 210 gigawatts of coal capacity</strong>, producing 73% of the electricity of India, which is <strong>not environmentally friendly</strong>.</li>
<li>Wind and solar powers are intermittent or variable.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead for India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The nuclear industry should move towards <strong>‘passive safety’ designs</strong> (for nuclear reactors). <strong>For example</strong>, active cooling pumps.</li>
<li><strong>New designs like small modular reactors</strong> will address the cost issue.</li>
<li><strong>Enforcing nuclear liability</strong>, for example, the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act 2010.</li>
<li><strong>Ending the monopoly</strong> of the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) in reactor operations. <strong>Allow other government companies</strong> like the NTPC.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If India hopes to achieve <strong>‘</strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/08/27/india-needs-a-10-tn-investment-for-reaching-the-net-zero-emission-target-by-2070/"><strong>net zero’ by 2070</strong></a>, it needs ~100 GW of nuclear power by 2050.</li>
<li>Therefore, India should never consider phasing out nuclear power, which is a low carbon, firm and reliable.</li>
<li><strong>India needs a portfolio of technologies</strong> to make nuclear power safe and cost-effective (capital cost) over time.</li>

The court corrected the government’s perspective and said that the <strong>impact of British Victorian morality made India forsake much of its cultural ethos</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>British Victorian morality</strong> refers to a set of <strong>social and moral values</strong> that were prevalent in Britain during the Victorian era (1837 to 1901).

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Talks between Indian and French officials over several issues, including liability, for the <strong>construction of six nuclear power reactors in Maharashtra’s Jaitapur</strong>, have not resulted in any breakthrough.</p>
<p><strong>Issues concerned:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>India’s Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act</strong> (CLNDA)</li>
<li><strong>The high cost of power per unit</strong></li>
<li><strong>Opposition from activists and locals</strong> for the fear of environmental damage and health hazards</li>
<li><strong>Safety concerns:</strong> Concerns over the <strong>safety of nuclear power</strong> have prompted Germany to switch off its last nuclear power reactor.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/science-technology/nuclear-technology/civil-nuclear-liability-act/"><strong>nuclear liability</strong></a><strong>?</strong></p>
<p>Nuclear liability refers to the legal responsibility for damages and compensation in case of a nuclear accident or incident. It involves determining who is responsible for the damages caused and who will pay for the compensation of those affected.</p>
<p><strong>What is CLNDA?</strong></p>
<p>It is an Indian law enacted in 2010 to provide a <strong>civil liability regime for nuclear damage</strong> in India. Key provisions of the Act:</p>
<ul>
<li>It provides for <strong>strict and no-fault liability on the operator</strong>, where it will be held liable for damage regardless of any fault on its part.</li>
<li>Concept of <strong>supplier of equipment’s liability</strong> over and above that of the operator’s</li>
<li>It specifies the <strong>liability of nuclear operators</strong></li>
<li>The compensation payable in the event of a nuclear incident</li>
<li>The process for <strong>claiming compensation</strong></li>
<li>Establishes the <strong>Nuclear Damage Claims Commission</strong> to adjudicate claims for compensation</li>
<li><strong>Establishes the Nuclear Liability Fund</strong> to provide financial support in the event of a nuclear incident.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Jaitapur nuclear power project (signed in 2010):</strong></p>
<p>It is a proposed <strong>9,900 MW nuclear power plant in Maharashtra</strong>, India. It is planned to be constructed by the <strong>French energy company Electricite de France (EDF)</strong>, using <strong>six</strong> <strong>European pressurised reactors</strong> (EPRs). It is the <strong>world’s biggest nuclear power generation</strong> site under consideration at present</p>
<p><strong>About Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage (CSC) (adopted 1997):</strong></p>
<p>It seeks to establish a <strong>uniform global legal regime</strong> for compensation to victims in the unlikely event of a nuclear accident. India is a party to it. It is based on the exclusive liability of the <strong>operator of a nuclear installation and no other person (but Indian law provides for the Supplier’s liability as well)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> A recent study by German researchers suggests that <strong>hydrogen could be used for steelmaking instead of Carbon</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>What is steel?</strong></p>
<p>Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon with improved strength and fracture resistance compared to other forms of iron. Strong steel consists of a tiny amount – <strong>less than 1%</strong> – of carbon.</p>
<p><strong>Issues with the current method of steelmaking:</strong></p>
<p>The current method of steelmaking— the blast furnace/basic oxygen furnace route, and the electric arc furnace route—contributes to <strong>5-7%</strong> of global emissions. Making one tonne of steel releases <strong>1.8 tonnes of carbon dioxide</strong></p>

<p><strong>Thus, the new process releases significantly less Green House gas.</strong></p>
<p><strong>India’s status:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Why SC changed its 2022 order?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The earlier order had <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/19/why-has-the-creation-of-eco-sensitive-zones-provoked-protests/">affected <strong>hundreds of villages</strong></a> <strong>in the peripheries of forests</strong>,</li>
<li>The stringent observance of the judgment would <strong>hamper the development of basic infrastructure</strong> like schools, dispensaries, and roads, and affect eco-development activities around national parks and sanctuaries.</li>
<li>The order would also impact <strong>certain projects of national and strategic importance</strong> such as the construction of national highways, railways, defence-related infrastructure, etc.</li>
