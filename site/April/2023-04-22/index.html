<p><strong>Context:</strong> UNICEF released its global flagship report ‘The State of the World’s Children 2023: For Every Child, Vaccination,’ highlighting the significance of childhood immunization.</p>
<p><strong>What is Immunization?</strong></p>
<p>Immunization, also known as vaccination, is the process of protecting an individual or a population from disease by introducing a <strong>substance that stimulates the body’s immune system</strong> to recognize and fight the disease-causing agent, such as a virus or bacteria.</p>
<p><strong>The major findings of the report are:</strong></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Finding</strong></td>
<td><strong>Example</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>The decline in vaccine confidence globally</strong></td>
<td>Over a third of the 55 countries studied for <strong>vaccine confidence showed a decline.</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>The largest decline in childhood immunization in 30 years</strong></td>
<td>A total of <strong>67 million children missed out on vaccinations</strong> between 2019 and 2021. In 2022, the number of measles cases was more than double the total in the previous year.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Existing inequities in vaccination access</strong></td>
<td>Unvaccinated children often live in <strong>hard-to-reach communities</strong> such as rural areas or urban slums.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>The growing threat of Vaccine Hesitancy</strong></td>
<td>There is a growing threat of vaccine hesitancy due to factors such as <strong>access to misleading information and declining trust in vaccine efficacy.</strong></td>
</tr>

</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Decrease in the number of zero-dose children during the pandemic</strong></td>
<td>Between 2020 and 2021, the number of <strong>zero-dose children</strong> in India decreased from <strong>3 million to 2.7</strong> million. However, India was among the <strong>top 20 countries with the largest numbers of zero-dose children</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Improvement in the ‘Importance Given to Vaccines’</strong></td>
<td>98% of the population in India currently perceive vaccines as important for children</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Emphasizes sustained evidence-based catch-up campaigns</strong></td>
<td>India was able to <strong>bring down the number of zero-dose children</strong> due to sustained evidence-based catch-up <strong>campaigns (e.g.,</strong> Intensified Mission Indradhanush (IMI), ASHA workers, routine immunization)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Accelerating the implementation</strong></td>
<td>Increase the implementation of <strong>Immunization Agenda 2030</strong> and <strong>Gavi Strategy 5.0</strong> to promote equity and sustainably scale up immunization coverage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Strengthen demand for vaccination</strong></td>
<td>Demand for vaccination can be strengthened by talking to communities, tackling gender barriers, and rethinking accountability in health systems.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Importance of investing in primary healthcare</strong></td>
<td>Spending more on <strong>immunization and health by investing in primary health care</strong> at the national level can help promote sustainable and equitable vaccine coverage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Need to build resilient systems</strong></td>
<td>E.g., India’s digital health platform <strong>TeCHO+ (Technology Enabled Community Health Operations)</strong> and <strong>electronic vaccine intelligence network (eVIN)</strong> increased vaccination coverage while enhancing data entry efficiency</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Reaching the last child with immunization is a key marker of equity that benefits not only the child but also the whole community. Routine immunizations and strong health systems can best prepare us in preventing future pandemics and reducing morbidity and mortality.</p>
<p><strong>Terms used:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>“Zero dose children”</strong> refers to children who have <strong>not received any vaccines at all</strong> or have not received any vaccines according to the recommended schedule for their age.</li>
<li><strong>Vaccine Hesitancy:</strong> Vaccine hesitancy refers to the reluctance of an individual or a group of people to get vaccinated despite the availability of vaccines.</li>
<li><strong>Vaccine confidence</strong> refers to the level of trust and belief individuals and communities have in the safety and effectiveness of vaccines.</li>

<p><strong>China and Central Asia:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>China shares <strong>a long history of trade, culture, and people-to-people links</strong> with the Central Asian region, which lies on the <strong>ancient Silk Route</strong>.</li>
<li>Modern China’s involvement with the region began with the <strong>break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991</strong>.</li>
<li>Diplomatic relations were established in <strong>1992</strong>, and China’s relationship with the region was institutionalised as the <strong>Shanghai Five</strong>, the forerunner of the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/09/18/shanghai-cooperation-organisation-sco-3/"><strong>Shanghai Cooperation Organisation</strong> (SCO).</a></li>

<p><strong>Friction points between China and Central Asia</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Beijing’s targeting of the Muslim population of Xinjiang</strong> has triggered resentment in these countries, where Islam is the principal religion.</li>
<li><strong>The increasing presence</strong> of Chinese workers and rapid land acquisitions by China in these countries has led to public protests.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>China’s ‘Grand Plan’ for Relations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The region is economically dependent on Russia</strong>, which is also Central Asia’s net security provider.</li>
<li><strong>Russia’s trade with these countries has increased</strong> over the last year, as it attempts to find substitutes for imports from Europe.</li>
<li><strong>Russia also has a huge migrant population of Central Asians</strong> who bind the region to it in economic dependency.</li>
<li><strong>Russia and China</strong> are now competing for the title of the top trading partner in the area. The trade between China and the five countries reached <strong>$70.2</strong> billion last year.</li>
<li>Beijing is making use of <strong>Russia’s preoccupation in Ukraine</strong> to push Moscow out of its own strategic backyard.</li>
<li>The Ukrainian invasion has given rise to fears (among Central Asian countries) that a <strong>security relationship with Moscow could prove to be a double-edged weapon.</strong></li>

<ul>
<li>While India has trading ties with these countries, it is <strong>hindered by the absence of a land route to Central Asia</strong>, with Pakistan denying its passage and Afghanistan being uncertain territory after the Taliban takeover.</li>
<li><strong>The</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/02/01/chabahar-port-3/#:~:text=Why%20Chabahar%20port%20is%20important,Iran%2C%20Europe%20and%20Central%20Asia."><strong>Chabahar port</strong></a> <strong>in Iran</strong> offers an alternative route, but it is not fully developed yet.</li>
<li>Also, India’s relationships in the region (including in the SCO) <strong>remain security-driven</strong>.</li>
<li>There have been suggestions that India should provide connectivity for people and trade in Central Asia through “<strong>air corridors</strong>”, as it had done for Afghanistan.</li>
<li>As a first, <strong>New Delhi made its biggest outreach to Central Asia</strong>, when the PM of India hosted a virtual summit of the C5 last year.</li>
<li>New Delhi’s leadership of the SCO this year may provide it with an opportunity to diversify relations with this strategic region.</li>

<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Since water is a <strong>state subject</strong> under the 7th Schedule of the Indian Constitution, the relevant State Governments are primarily responsible for taking action.</li>
<li>Through a number of schemes and programs, <strong>the Central Government offers technical and financial assistance to support their efforts.</strong><ul>
<li>As an illustration, the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/welfare-schemes/schemes-under-ministry-of-agriculture/pradhan-mantri-krishi-sinchai-yojana/"><strong>Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana</strong></a> (PMKSY)-Har Khet Ko Pani (HKKP) scheme provides for the Repair, Renovation, and Restoration (RRR) of Water Bodies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The First Census of Water Bodies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Objective:</strong> To develop a national database for all water bodies by collecting information on their size, condition, status of encroachments, use, storage capacity, the status of filling up of storage, etc.</li>
<li><strong>What is unique about the census?</strong><ul>
<li>Until the 5th minor irrigation census, water body data was only available at the village level.</li>
<li>The first water body census <strong>included data on all types of water bodies in both rural and urban areas.</strong></li>
<li>For the first time, data on the <strong>encroachment</strong> of water bodies was also gathered during the census.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The census defines a water body as</strong>: All natural or man-made units bounded on all sides with some or no masonry work used for storing water for irrigation or other purposes (industrial, domestic or drinking, groundwater recharge, etc).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Highlights of the first census:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>24,24,540</strong> water bodies have been enumerated in the country, out of which <strong>1%</strong> are in rural areas and only <strong>2.9%</strong> in urban areas.</li>
<li>West Bengal’s <strong>South 24 Parganas</strong> has been ranked as the top district having the highest (<strong>55 lakh</strong>) number of water bodies across the country.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/states.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/states.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Classification of water bodies:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/distribution.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/distribution.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>West Bengal</strong> has the highest number of ponds and reservoirs, whereas <strong>Andhra Pradesh</strong> has the highest number of tanks.</li>
<li><strong>Tamil Nadu</strong> has the highest number of lakes and <strong>Maharashtra</strong> is the leading state with water conservation schemes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Data on encroachment:</strong> 1.6% of water bodies are reported to be encroached, out of which 95.4% are in rural areas and the remaining 4.6% in urban areas.</p>
<p><strong>Way ahead for Augmentation, Conservation and Efficient Management of Water Resources:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Inclusion of water bodies in land records</li>
<li>Making them an integral part of the town planning process</li>
<li>Strict action against the encroachers</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: Kerala became the first state to <strong>adopt a water budget</strong>, as a solution to water scarcity during summer months to ensure equitable water distribution.</p>
<p><strong>What is Water Budget?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A water budget</strong> is a tool used to manage water resources by <strong>estimating the total amount of water available</strong> in a region and the amount of water used by different sectors.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It helps in making <strong>informed decisions</strong> about water use</li>
<li>Identifying areas of water scarcity</li>
<li>Developing strategies for equitable water distribution.</li>
<li>Create awareness about proper water use and avoiding wastage.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other initiatives of the Kerala government</strong>: It has revived <strong>over 15,000 kilometres</strong> of waterways in the last few years, and local bodies are rejuvenating more ponds and streams.</p>
<p><strong>Usage:</strong> This can be used as an example in Governance, and Agriculture questions on water management.</p>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/money/income-tax/supreme-court-tax-ruling-may-add-to-litigation/3056350/"><strong>FE</strong></a> </p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The recent Supreme Court ruling that the <strong>“arm’s length price”</strong> determined by the <strong>Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT)</strong> cannot be treated as final in disputes related to alleged <strong>income suppression by multinational companies</strong> could potentially increase fresh litigation and delay final decisions.</p>
<p><strong>What is Transfer pricing?</strong></p>
<p>Transfer pricing refers to the <strong>pricing of goods, services, or intellectual property</strong> that is sold between two or more companies that are part of the same multinational enterprise (e.g., subsidiaries).</p>
<p><strong>What is the “arm’s length price”?</strong></p>
<p>Arm’s length price is a transaction in which <strong>buyers and sellers of a product act independently and have no relationship</strong> with each other.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of the Judgement:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It may <strong>delay and increase the litigation</strong></li>
<li>The ruling may increase the use of conciliatory mechanisms like <strong>advance pricing agreements</strong> (APAs)</li>
<li>It could also increase the utility of <strong>MAP (mutual agreement procedure</strong>), as an alternate dispute resolution mechanism.</li>
<li><strong>It will increase the usefulness of Safe Harbour rules—</strong>which restrain the tax authority from <strong>questioning the pricing of certain transactions</strong> between multinational companies and their subsidiaries.</li>
