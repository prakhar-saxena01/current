<h4 id="gs-paper-1"><strong>GS Paper 1</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Population and associated issues</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/governance/match-migrants-skills-with-needs-of-ageing-countries-to-drive-global-growth-world-bank-report-88946"><strong>DTE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The <strong>‘</strong>World Development Report 2023: Migrants, Refugees, and Societies’ was recently released by the World Bank.</p>
<p><strong>The World Development Report (WDR):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is an <strong>annual</strong> report published since <strong>1978</strong> by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development <strong>(IBRD) or World Bank.</strong></li>
<li>It provides an in-depth analysis of a <strong>specific aspect of economic development</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Highlights of the WDR 2023:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The share of working-age adults will drop sharply</strong> in many (developed) countries over the next few decades.<ul>
<li><strong>Spain</strong>, with a population of 47 million, is projected to shrink by more than one-third by 2100, with those above age 65 increasing from 20 to 39% of the population.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Most low-income countries are expected to see rapid population growth, putting them under pressure to create <strong>more jobs for young people</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Opportunities offered by migration:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Migration is becoming more urgent</strong> due to <strong>severe divergences between and within countries</strong> – in terms of real wages, labour market opportunities, demographic patterns and climate costs.</li>
<li><strong>It can be a unique opportunity</strong> for economies and people as well as meet the growing needs of both origin and destination countries.</li>
<li>Migrants <strong>transfer ideas, knowledge, and technology, spurring job creation</strong> <strong>and modernisation</strong> – just as US Silicon Valley expatriates did when they helped nurture India’s IT sector.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As populations across the globe <strong>age</strong> at an unprecedented pace, <strong>the global competition for workers and talent will intensify.</strong></li>
<li>About 184 million people worldwide (including 37 million refugees) <strong>lack citizenship in the country in which they live.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/economic.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/economic.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Recommendations to promote migration:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The WB proposed <strong>policies</strong> to harness economic opportunities and for better migration management in destination, transit and origin countries (to mitigate the risks that migrants face). <strong>For example</strong>,<ul>
<li><strong>Origin countries</strong> should make labour migration an explicit part of their development strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Destination countries</strong> should facilitate their <strong>inclusion and address social impacts</strong> that raise concerns among their citizens</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Match-Motive Framework:</strong> By combining “match” and “motive,” the framework identified policy priorities for countries.<ul>
<li><strong>The “match” aspect</strong> is grounded in labour economics and focuses on how well migrants’ skills and related attributes match the needs of the destination countries.</li>
<li><strong>The “motive” refers</strong> to the circumstances under which a person moves in search of opportunity.</li>
<li>This determines the extent to which migrants, origin countries and destination countries gain from migration: <strong>The stronger the match, the larger the gains</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The report also urged for <strong>international cooperation and multilateral efforts</strong> to strengthen the match of migrants’ skills with the needs of destination societies.</li>
</ul>

<td><strong>What was the case about?</strong></td>
<td><strong>The extent of Parliament’s power</strong> to amend the Constitution was the backdrop of the <strong>tussle between the executive and the judiciary</strong> in the first two decades of the republic.<br><br>By the <strong>1st Amendment of 1951</strong>, the 9th Schedule was inserted – any law placed in this Schedule could not be questioned in any court of law.<br><br>In  <strong>Shankari Prasad v. Union of India (1951),</strong> the SC upheld the 1st Amendment and held that Parliament’s power to amend any part of the Constitution was limitless.<br><br>In <strong>Sajjan Singh v. State of Rajasthan (1965)</strong>, the SC asked whether the Parliament could take away even the critical fundamental rights<br><br>In <strong>Golaknath v State of Punjab (1967)</strong>, the SC ruled that Parliament cannot amend fundamental rights.<br><br>The <strong>24th Amendment 1971</strong> – amended <strong>Articles 13, 368</strong> – provided Parliament with the powers to amend any provision of the Constitution and insulated such amendments from <strong>Judicial Review.</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Verdict</strong></td>
<td><strong>A 13-judge Constitution Bench</strong> of the SC (with a 7-6 majority) redefined the relationship between Parliament and the Constitution by ruling that the “<strong>basic structure</strong>” of the Constitution is inviolable, and cannot be amended by Parliament.<br><br>While the Parliament had vast powers to amend the Constitution, <strong>certain parts</strong> (“basic structure”) <strong>are so inherent and intrinsic to the Constitution</strong> that even Parliament cannot touch it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>What is the basic structure doctrine?</strong></td>
<td>The origins of the basic structure doctrine are found in the <strong>German Constitution</strong>.<br><br><strong>In India</strong>, while parliamentary democracy, fundamental rights, judicial review, and secularism are all held by courts as basic structures, <strong>the list is not exhaustive</strong> (decided by the court on a case-by-case basis).<br><br>The basic structure doctrine has <strong>formed the bedrock of</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/structure-organization-and-functioning-of-the/judiciary/judicial-review/#:~:text=Judicial%20review%20is%20the%20power,challenged%20by%20the%20affected%20person."><strong>judicial review</strong></a> of all laws passed by the Indian Parliament.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>A scrutiny of the application of the doctrine over the past 50 years:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Although the highest court has invoked “basic structure” <strong>sparingly</strong>, it has <strong>mostly struck down amendments where judicial powers</strong> have been curtailed.</li>
<li>Since 1973, the Constitution has been <strong>amended more than 60 times</strong>. In at least <strong>16 cases</strong>, the SC has evaluated constitutional amendments with regard to the basic structure doctrine.</li>
<li><strong>9/16</strong> constitutional amendments have been upheld by the SC. <strong>6 of these cases relate to</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/01/22/50-reservation-limit/"><strong>reservations</strong></a> [OBC, EWS and reservations in promotions].</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Constitutional amendment entirely stuck down by the SC:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/05/30/national-judicial-appointments-commission-njac/"><strong>Constitution (99th Amendment) Act 2014</strong></a>, which established the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) was struck down in 2015 on the grounds that it threatened “<strong>judicial independence</strong>” – a basic feature of the Constitution.</li>
<li><strong>NJAC</strong> would have been responsible for the appointment and transfer of judges, replacing the current Collegium system.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Constitutional amendments partially stuck down by the SC:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In 6 instances</strong>, including the Kesavananda ruling itself, the SC has “partially struck down” a constitutional amendment.</li>
<li>In all these cases, the provision that was struck down related to the <strong>denial of judicial review.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6 instances when SC partially stuck down an amendment:</strong> Out of 6, 5 were during the Indira Gandhi era.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kesavananda Bharati vs State of Kerala (1973):</strong> While the court upheld the land ceiling laws that were challenged, <strong>it struck down the following portion of the 25th Amendment (1972)</strong> –<ul>
<li>If any law is passed to give effect to the <strong>DPSP</strong> it cannot be deemed to be void on the ground that it abridged rights under <strong>Articles 14, 19 or 31</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Indira Gandhi v Raj Narain (1975):</strong> The SC struck down The Constitution (39th Amendment) Act 1975, which barred it from hearing a challenge to the election of President, PM, VP, and Speaker of Lok Sabha.</li>
<li><strong>Minerva Mills Ltd vs Union Of India (1980):</strong> The SC struck down a clause inserted in <strong>Article 368</strong>, which said there shall be <strong>no limitation on the constituent power of Parliament</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>P Sambamurthy v State of Andhra Pradesh (1986):</strong> The SC struck down a portion of the 32nd Amendment (1973), which constituted an Administrative Tribunal for Andhra Pradesh, <strong>taking away the jurisdiction of the High Court.</strong></li>
<li><strong>L Chandra Kumar v Union of India (1997):</strong> The top court struck down a portion of the 42nd Amendment 1976, which set up administrative tribunals excluding judicial review by High Courts.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/07/18/karnataka-crisis-what-was-scs-kihoto-hollohan-order-of-1992-what-is-the-role-of-speaker/"><strong>Kihoto Hollohan vs Zachillhu And Others (1992</strong></a><strong>):</strong> The SC upheld The Constitution (<strong>52nd</strong> Amendment) Act that introduced the <strong>10th Schedule/anti-defection law</strong> in the Constitution.<ul>
<li>However, the only portion of the amendment that was struck down was that <strong>the decisions of the Speaker relating to disqualification cannot be judicially reviewed</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance of the verdict:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The ruling (by the narrowest possible margin of 7-6) has <strong>rejected majoritarian impulses</strong> and <strong>underlined the foundations of a modern democracy</strong> saving both the <strong>constitution and constitutionalism</strong>.</li>
<li>However, it marked <strong>a definite assertion of the judiciary</strong> against the majoritarian Parliament leading to <strong>Parliamentary sovereignty vs Judicial supremacy,</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/structure-organization-and-functioning-of-the/judiciary/judicial-activism-and-judicial-over-reach/"><strong>Judicial activism vs overreach</strong></a></li>
<li>A highly controversial <strong>pluralist judicial creation</strong> has been <strong>accepted now</strong> by legislatures, the executive, and the people of India.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The SC said that governors should clear bills passed by the legislative assemblies as soon as possible, as mandated under Article 200 of the Indian Constitution.</p>
<p><strong>Article 200:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It gives governors the power to either grant assent</strong> to a bill, withhold assent or reserve the bill for the president’s consideration in certain cases.</li>
<li><strong>The governor may return the bill</strong> (if it is not a Money Bill) requesting the House/Houses to reconsider the bill.</li>
<li>If such a bill is passed again by the House/Houses with/without amendment and presented to the governor for assent, <strong>the governor shall not withhold assent.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The plea in the SC:</strong> A plea was filed by the Telangana government <strong>seeking directions to the governor</strong> to clear ten bills passed by the state Assembly.</p>
<p><strong>What are the SC’s observations?</strong></p>

<li>Article 200 states that the governor must “<strong>as soon as possible</strong>” after the presentation of the bill for assent return the bill for reconsideration to the House/Houses of the state legislature.</li>
<li>The expression “as soon as possible” has <strong>a significant constitutional intent and must be borne into mind.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The issue:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The issue that is agitating State governments (<strong>Kerala, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Chhattisgarh and West Bengal</strong>) is the non-decision/indecision on the part of the governor on a bill passed by the Assembly.</li>
<li>In a new constitutional development, <strong>the TN Assembly passed a resolution</strong> urging the President of India <strong>to fix a timeline for assent</strong> to be given to bills passed by the Assembly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why is this resolution a new constitutional development?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Article 355 of the Constitution</strong> says that it shall be the duty of the Union to ensure that the government of every State is carried on in accordance with the Constitution.<ul>
<li>This provision justifies the “<strong>invasion of the provincial field</strong>” by the Union government and the proclamation of the <strong>President’s rule</strong> (under Article 356) in a State.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the governor violates Article 200 and <strong>sits on the bills indefinitely</strong> (an option not given by the Constitution), s/he is creating a situation where <strong>governance of the state cannot be carried on in accordance with the Constitution</strong>.</li>
<li>In such a situation, <strong>the government of the State has a constitutional duty to invoke Article 355</strong> and request the President to give suitable instructions to the Governor.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The practice followed in the United Kingdom</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The veto could <strong>only be exercised on ministerial advice</strong>.</li>
<li>Refusal of royal assent on the ground that the monarch strongly disapproves of a bill/ it was intensely controversial would be <strong>unconstitutional</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Case of India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Under Article 154 of the Constitution</strong>, the governor can exercise his/her executive powers <strong>only on the advice of the Council of Ministers</strong>.</li>
<li>Whether the Governor (under Article 200) can withhold his/her assent to a bill in the exercise of his/her <strong>discretionary powers?</strong></li>
<li>Under the constitutional scheme, the governor is <strong>only a constitutional head</strong> and has no real powers.</li>
<li>According to constitutional experts, <strong>the governor can withhold assent to a bill only on ministerial advice.</strong></li>
<li>Hence, there is a <strong>confusion</strong> on the issue in India.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A bill is <strong>a policy imperative of the elected government which is responsible to the people</strong>.</li>
<li>Withholding assent means the <strong>death of the bill</strong>. Therefore, the government can challenge the inaction of the governor in a court of law.</li>
<li><strong>The SC must fix a reasonable time frame</strong> for governors to take a decision on a bill passed by the Assembly in the <strong>larger interest of federalism</strong> in the country.</li>

<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Environmental Pollution &amp; Degradation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/pollution/indoor-air-pollution-can-slow-down-brain-development-in-infants-study-88951"><strong>DTE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> According to a study, India’s poor indoor air quality can impair cognitive development in children under two years when brain growth is at its peak.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/indoor.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/indoor.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Highlights of the study:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Poor air quality in households that used solid cooking materials such as <strong>cow dung cake</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Very small particulate fragments</strong> (PM 2.5) in the air are a major concern as they can move from the respiratory tract into the <strong>brain</strong>.</li>
<li>Infants (&lt;2 years) from these houses had <strong>lower visual memory scores and slower visual processing speeds</strong>.</li>
<li>As children grow up in polluted environments, <strong>their developing organs and bodies are affected.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong> Long-term consequences for life → lower economic productivity → increased burden on healthcare and mental health systems.</p>
<p><strong>Concerns for India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>According to the State of Global Air 2020 report, <strong>over 116,000 infants in India died</strong> within a month of birth in 2019 due to air pollution, outdoor and indoor.</li>
<li>Every third child in Delhi has impaired lungs making them vulnerable to <strong>metabolic diseases.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong> Since indoor air quality is linked to cooking fuels, <strong>efforts to reduce cooking emissions should be a key target for intervention.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Control measures:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Public awareness</li>
<li>Change in pattern of fuel use <strong>(PM Ujjwala Yojana,</strong> National Biogas and Manure Management Programme, <strong>GOBARdhan Scheme)</strong></li>
<li>Modification of design of cooking stove (<strong>Unnat Chulha Abhiyan</strong>)</li>
<li>Improvement in ventilation</li>
<li>Intersectoral coordination and global initiative</li>

<p><strong>Why does relative humidity matter?</strong></p>
<p>Relative humidity plays a significant role in how comfortable we feel in different environments. When the <strong>relative humidity is high</strong>, the air is already filled with moisture, and the sweat on <strong>our skin can’t evaporate</strong>. This makes it difficult for our bodies to cool down, which can be <strong>dangerous in hot weather</strong>. In general, a relative <strong>humidity of 30-60%</strong> is considered comfortable, and environments with lower humidity may require humidifiers to increase moisture levels. On the other hand, a fan can be useful in areas with higher humidity to help move the air and promote sweat evaporation.</p>
<p><strong>What is Wet Bulb Temperature?</strong></p>
<p>Wet bulb temperature is the <strong>lowest temperature to which air can be cooled by the evaporation of water</strong> at constant pressure, and it is a <strong>limit beyond which humans cannot tolerate high temperatures</strong>. It is measured by wrapping a wet cloth on a thermometer to observe the temperature at which evaporation occurs. The highest acceptable wet-bulb temperature for humans is <strong>35°C (95°F) for six hours</strong>, above which serious health problems can develop, even for healthy individuals.</p>
