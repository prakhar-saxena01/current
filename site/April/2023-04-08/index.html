<p><strong>Challenges in the relationship:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Distance and Lack of Connectivity</strong></li>
<li><strong>Language Barrier:</strong> Spanish and Portuguese are the dominant languages in the region, while India’s official language is Hindi and English.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Cultural Understanding</strong></li>
<li><strong>Protectionist Policies:</strong> Protectionist measures (by both regions), such as tariffs and non-tariff barriers, could increase costs for businesses and restrict access to markets.</li>
<li><strong>Political Instability:</strong> Political instability and economic uncertainties in some Latin American countries could deter Indian businesses from investing in the region.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of High-Level Interactions:</strong> High-level interactions between India and Latin America have been limited.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>India’s trade with Latin America is negligible in comparison to China’s <strong>$450 billion</strong> trading in that region. Historically, Indian businesses have lagged in LAC. Hence, India will need to <strong>step up its economic diplomacy</strong> and join regional economic institutions like the <strong>Inter-American Development Bank.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Important International Institutions, agencies and fora – their Structure, Mandate</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/75-years-of-the-who-8543500/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Despite some great successes, the 75-year-old World Health Organization (WHO) has received its fair share of criticism.</p>
<p><strong>The World Health Organization (WHO):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is a <strong>specialised agency of the UN</strong> (HQ – Geneva, Switzerland) established on <strong>7 April</strong> (World Health Day) 1948 and is responsible for <strong>international public health.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Members: 194</strong> member states</li>
<li><strong>The World Health Assembly</strong> is the <strong>decision-making body</strong> of the WHO<ul>
<li>Composed of health ministers from member states, <strong>WHA selects the director-general</strong> of the WHO <strong>(currently – Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus of Ethiopia).</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mandate:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Working worldwide to promote health and well-being → serving the vulnerable,</li>
<li>Coordinating responses to health emergencies,</li>
<li>Providing technical assistance to countries → <strong>Set international health standards</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Achievements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Eradication of <strong>smallpox (1980) –</strong> the only human disease to be eradicated, the near-eradication of <strong>polio</strong>, and the development of an <strong>Ebola</strong></li>
<li>Efforts helped in realising the <strong>goal of health as a</strong> <strong>human right.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Current priorities include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Communicable diseases:</strong> HIV/AIDS, Ebola, COVID-19, malaria and tuberculosis</li>
<li><strong>Non-communicable diseases:</strong> Heart disease and cancer; healthy diet, nutrition, and food security; occupational health; and substance abuse.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The failed attempts of WHO:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Eradication of malaria:</strong> The WHO launched the <strong>Global Malaria Eradication Programme</strong> (1955). But there was little/no progress and the program was discontinued in 1969.</li>
<li><strong>COVID-19:</strong> Some critics complained that the WHO <strong>failed in the early detection of the disease</strong> and was <strong>not doing enough to support member states</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Main issues faced by the WHO:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stymied by a <strong>divided world</strong> with <strong>nations advancing their own interests at the cost of others</strong>.</li>
<li>WHO does not have the authority –<ul>
<li><strong>to enforce its recommendations.</strong></li>
<li>to take action in a member state unless that member state asks for help.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The funding mechanism</strong> (voluntary contributions) lacks transparency and accountability framework.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Changes made by the WHO to its structure:</strong> It now cooperates with tech companies and <strong>relies to a lesser degree on national governments for crucial health information</strong> → lowering the chances of missing the start of another serious disease outbreak.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges and way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The world will experience <strong>more frequent and more severe health threats</strong> in the future.</li>
<li>It means there is a need to come together around joint priorities and support WHO to –<ul>
<li>Strengthen the <strong>Public Health Emergency of International Concern</strong> (<strong>PHEIC</strong>) declaration process</li>
<li>Devise a collaborative mechanism to disburse funding for projects without bias.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> These reforms will help the WHO to become a truly global health enforcement policy.</p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-2_2"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Bilateral, regional and global groupings and agreements involving India and/or affecting India’s interests</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/some-advice-to-india-on-the-ifa-negotiations/article66711402.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> India should not be opposed to joining the <strong>investment facilitation agreement (IFA)</strong> negotiations for fear of <strong>investor-state dispute settlement</strong> claims.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Even if the <strong>World Trade Organization</strong> (WTO) is inactive, IFA is one area of rule-making where there is a lot of action.</li>
<li>Backed by <strong>over 100 countries</strong> (it does not include India), the proposed IFA is <strong>meant to create legally binding provisions aimed at facilitating investment flows</strong>.</li>
<li>This will require states <strong>to augment regulatory transparency and predictability</strong> of investment measures.</li>
<li>This agreement will be <strong>very different from investment protection agreements</strong> (such as <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Bilateral-Investment-Treaty-BIT.pdf">BIT</a>s) that allow foreign investors to bring claims against the host state for alleged treaty breaches.</li>
<li>This is known as <strong>investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS).</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why is India not a party to IFA negotiations?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fear of ISDS:</strong> Apprehension that foreign investors could use a future IFA to bring claims under the existing BITs.</li>
<li><strong>Foreign investors may use the –</strong><ul>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/03/14/most-favoured-nation-status/#:~:text=Most%20Favoured%20Nation%20is%20a,discriminate%20between%20its%20trade%20partners."><strong>Most favoured nation (MFN)</strong></a> <strong>provision in BITs:</strong> To import terms from the IFA that they believe to be more favourable than those provided in the underlying BIT.</li>
<li><strong>Ubiquitous provision of fair and equitable treatment (FET) in BITs:</strong> To challenge non-compliance with IFA.</li>
<li><strong>‘Umbrella clause’ in BIT:</strong> A clause that allows contractual and other commitments owed to a foreign investor to be brought under the treaty’s protective umbrella.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>These are mere presumptions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Many BITs exempt an economic integration agreement</strong> from the application of MFN. Thus, the possibility of importing IFA provisions into the BIT is remote.</li>
<li><strong>It is unlikely that an ISDS tribunal</strong> will accept the claim that a simple IFA violation breaches an investor’s reasonable expectations.</li>
<li>Most new investment treaties avoid ‘umbrella clauses’ altogether.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The IFA categorically state that it<ul>
<li><strong>Cannot be used to interpret or apply any rule</strong> for the protection of investment contained in any investment treaty.</li>
<li><strong>Does not create rights for non-signatory countries</strong> and their investors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Reforming BITs:</strong> Countries can amend their respective BITs to exclude the IFA from its scope.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The possibility of an audacious ISDS tribunal interpreting provisions broadly can never be ruled out. But this cannot be a basis to oppose international law-making.</p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-3"><strong>GS Paper 3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Infrastructure/disaster management</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/water/old-temples-of-modern-india-can-india-decommission-ageing-dams-it-has-been-warned-about--88654"><strong>DTE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Water red-flagged dam safety issues, but there was a poor response from people.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Of the 5,745 large dams in the country, 5,334 are operational.</li>
<li>Dams (especially large ones) are <strong>highly controversial</strong> in India. They –<ul>
<li>Have Destroyed vast swathes of natural forests,</li>
<li>Displaced millions of people,</li>
<li>Led to disasters – dams floods,</li>
<li>Fuelled inter-state conflicts,</li>
<li>Emit methane,</li>
<li><strong>Fragmenting</strong> freshwater species’ habitats, <strong>alter rivers’ hydrology</strong> and affect freshwater ecosystems by <strong>inundation</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But they have also changed the Indian civilisations by evolving new ways of <strong>farming, urbanisation and industrialisation</strong> → <strong>power generation</strong> → emerged as important human-made <strong>wetlands</strong> → making it challenging to decommission the aged/unsafe ones.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/flood3.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/flood3.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Concerns raised by the Parliamentary Committee over the safety of ageing dams:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Of the operational dams, <strong>234 have outlived their lifespan of 100 years</strong> (some even older than 300 years).</li>
<li>Panel flagged 36 dam disasters. The worst was the <strong>1979 Machhu dam disaster</strong> in Morbi, Gujarat.</li>
<li>Dams have <strong>already altered the local ecology</strong>, societies, economies and even micro-climatic conditions.</li>
<li>Though decommissioning might create new conflict zones, the Committee has asked for <strong>charting paths for decommissioning of ageing and unsafe dams</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Statutory and institutional arrangements of dam safety in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Under the <strong>7th Schedule</strong> of the Constitution of India, water and water storage is a <strong>state subject.</strong></li>
<li>However, the Central Government can enact legislation in <strong>3 scenarios</strong> –<ul>

<p><strong>Kongthong village in Meghalaya</strong> is India’s only whistling village. Kongthong is located in the East Khasi Hills in Meghalaya and is popular as the ‘whistling village’ due to its unique tradition of <strong>‘Jingrwai Lawbei’</strong> (meaning the Song of the Clan’s First Woman) under which mothers create a tune for their newborns. These tunes are often used as names.</p>
<p>Kongthong people belong to the <strong>Seng Khasi Tribe and speak the Khasi language</strong></p>
<p><strong>Usage</strong>: This is one of the examples of unique dying traditions of India which need to be preserved. You can cite it in the questions on the themes of Indian culture, and tribal traditions.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/07/23/sansad-tv-perspective-14th-brics-summit/">BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa)</a> are reportedly working on their own currency – established on a strategy that <strong>‘does not defend the dollar or euro’</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>What is de-dollarization?</strong></p>
<p>De-dollarization refers to the process of reducing the use of the US dollar in international trade and finance. This may involve countries diversifying their foreign currency reserves by holding fewer US dollars and more of other currencies.</p>
<p><strong>Need for de-dollarization</strong>: US dollar became the official reserve currency of the world in <strong>1944 (by the</strong> <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brettonwoodsagreement.asp"><strong>Bretton Woods Agreement).</strong></a> However, several countries have alleged that the US has been misusing dollar dominance by the imposition of sanctions as a tool to achieve foreign policy goals.</p>
<p><strong>Recent steps by India for De-dollarization:</strong> Trade in Indian Rupee (agreement has been signed with 18 countries, including UK, Germany, Russia and the United Arab Emirates); Currency Swap agreement.</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: Union Cabinet on Thursday approved a project to build an advanced gravitational-wave detector in the Hingoli district in Maharashtra. The facility’s construction is expected to be completed <strong>by 2030</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>What are Gravitational Waves?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gravitational waves are ripples in the fabric of space and time</strong> that travel at the speed of light. They are created by the motion of massive objects, such as black holes or neutron stars, which generate gravitational waves when they orbit or collide with each other.</p>
<p>According to <strong>Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativity</strong>, any object with mass warps the space-time around it. When two massive objects orbit each other or collide, they produce ripples or waves in space-time that propagate outward at the speed of light.</p>
<p>Gravitational waves are <strong>extremely weak and difficult to detect</strong>. They were first directly detected by the <strong>Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (</strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/01/09/laser-interferometer-gravitational-wave-observatory-ligo-project/"><strong>LIGO</strong></a><strong>) in 2015</strong>, a century after they were predicted by Einstein’s theory.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Short-beaked echidnas in Western Australia beat the heat by blowing mucus bubbles, according to researchers from Curtin University.</p>
<p><strong>About the short-beaked echidna</strong></p>
<p>It is one of four living species of echidna. It is covered in <strong>fur and spines and has a distinctive snout and a specialized tongue</strong>, which it uses to catch its insect prey (ant and termite) at a great speed.</p>

<p><strong>Other mechanisms used by animals to stay cool:</strong> <strong>Dog</strong> pant to cool off; <strong>Kangaroos</strong> lick their arms so that the evaporating saliva cools the underlying blood vessels; <strong>Vultures</strong> squirt watery poop on their naked legs; <strong>Birds</strong> and <strong>mammals</strong> fluff their feathers (to increase the air trapped near their skin which acts as an insulator to regulate body temperature); <strong>Jackrabbits</strong>, increase blood flow to their ears which dissipates heat more quickly.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> As per the <strong>CPCB, Ground-level ozone (O3)</strong> has started to emerge as Delhi’s lead pollutant during the day, particularly after rain, according to data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)</p>
<p><strong>About Ground-level Ozone:</strong></p>
<p>Ground-level ozone is a type of pollutant that is produced when two primary pollutants, nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds, react in sunlight and stagnant air. It is referred to as a <strong>“secondary” pollutant</strong> because it is not directly emitted, but rather formed through chemical reactions between these primary pollutants.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Dibang Wildlife Sanctuary in Arunachal Pradesh, India is set to become a tiger reserve, according to the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA).</p>
<p><strong>What is the issue?</strong></p>
<p>The announcement has caused <strong>concern among the Idu Mishmi people</strong> who believe that the reserve would <strong>restrict their access to the forest</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Who are Idu Mishmis?</strong></p>
<p>They are a sub-tribe of the Mishmi group (the other two Mishmi groups are Digaru and Miju)  in Arunachal Pradesh and have a strong connection to the region’s flora and fauna. According to Idu mythology, <strong>tigers are their “elder brothers</strong>,” and their belief system of myths and taboos protects many animals, including a prohibition on killing tigers.</p>
<p><strong>Idu Mishmis</strong> are an example of a <strong>‘cultural model of conservation’</strong> and they support wildlife protection.</p>
