<h4 id="gs-paper-2"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Indian Constitution—Historical Underpinnings, Evolution, Features, Amendments, Significant Provisions and Basic Structure</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/the-challenge-of-reviving-a-sense-of-fraternity/article66782068.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Since India imbibes the principle of ‘unity in diversity’, having a sense of fraternity is a virtue that is essential.</p>
<p><strong>Meaning of fraternity:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The word fraternity is <strong>derived from French</strong> to mean brotherhood, friendship, community and cooperation.</li>
<li>It is <strong>a sense of common brotherhood</strong> among all Indians giving <strong>unity and solidarity</strong> to social life.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The concept of fraternity in the Indian Constitution:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While submitting the Draft Constitution to the President of the Constituent Assembly (on 21 February 1948), <strong>B R Ambedkar</strong> (the chairman of the Drafting Committee) wrote that –<ul>
<li>The drafting committee had added a clause on “fraternity” in the Preamble</li>
<li>Even though it was <strong>not part of the Objective Resolution</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As a result, the <strong>Preamble</strong> (adopted on 26 November 1949, came into effect on 26 January 1950 and amended by the 42nd Amendment 1976) to the Indian Constitution mentions –<ul>
<li>“<strong>Fraternity assuring the dignity of the individual and unity and integrity of the Nation</strong>”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Article 51A</strong> (Fundamental Duties) added to by the 42nd Amendment 1976 referred to the duty of every citizen ‘<strong>to promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood amongst all the people of India</strong>’.</li>
<li>Both the Preamble and the Fundamental Duties can not be legally enforced, but have a <strong>moral, spiritual appeal.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why is fraternity essential?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is one of the <strong>four pillars of constitutional morality</strong> spelt out in the Preamble of India’s Constitution: justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity.</li>
<li><strong>Without fraternity, equality and liberty</strong> can’t be achieved, because the idea of fraternity is closely linked to <strong>social solidarity.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Gains coming from the other three are strengthened and enriched by a sense of fraternity.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges that the concept face in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fraternity remains the <strong>least understood, least discussed, and the least practised</strong> of the four pillars of constitutional morality.</li>
<li><strong>Inequality and prejudice.</strong></li>
<li>Politics of hate and weak democratic opposition.</li>
<li>Taking the form of <strong>loyalty to the state (nationalism)</strong>, neglecting the principle of solidarity among citizens.</li>
<li>Feminists often criticise the idea/definition of fraternity as it excludes “<strong>sisterhood</strong>.”</li>
<li><strong>Inter-state conflicts</strong> and challenges to internal security like <strong>left-wing extremism, terrorism, cybersecurity, fake news, etc</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steps taken by the Indian government:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Inter-state councils, Zonal councils, Social initiatives like <strong>Ek Bharat – Shrestha Bharat, National Foundation for Communal Harmony (NFCH)</strong>, etc.</li>
<li>A ‘uniform’ and ‘Common Minimum Programme for Value Education’ was launched across the entire schooling system with a focus on <strong>‘core Constitutional values’.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Balancing the</strong> dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the Nation.</li>
<li>For this,<ul>
<li>A functioning <strong>moral order</strong> in society and <strong>a public conscience</strong> is essential. This will help in imbibing the concept <strong>individually and collectively.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Each of Gandhiji’s Seven Social Sins</strong> must form the ethos of the socio-political fabric of India.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Ambedkar dreamed of an India in which divisions of caste and religion would gradually fade away in the spirit of fraternity. Therefore, investing in the concepts like fraternity would save society from fragmentation.</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Limitations of SEBI:</strong></p>
<p>SEBI has <strong>certain limitations in terms of its reach, enforcement powers, coordination with other regulatory bodies,</strong> resources, and keeping up with changing market dynamics. These limitations can <strong>create regulatory gaps and overlaps</strong>, leading to delays in the resolution of cases.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>SEBI’s alleged inaction in the <strong>Ketan Parekh scam and Satyam scandal</strong></li>
<li>SEBI’s inability to prevent the <strong>NSEL scam</strong></li>
<li>Failure of SEBI’s regulations to <strong>prevent the misuse of participatory notes (P-notes)</strong> by foreign investors</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>There is a need for continuous monitoring and improving market intelligence to strengthen enforcement. Also, India’s financial markets are still segmented, and <strong>a unified financial regulator</strong> may be required to remove overlaps and excluded boundaries.</p>

<td>To <strong>tightly regulate the way intermediaries</strong>, especially large platforms such as <strong>Google, Facebook, and YouTube</strong>, function when it comes to moderating user content</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Faster Removals and Provisions</strong></td>
<td>Social media companies will have to add “<strong>new procedures for faster removal”</strong> of content <strong>deemed illegal or harmful</strong>. They will also have to explain to users how their <strong>content takedown policy works</strong>. The DSA also allows users to challenge takedown decisions taken by platforms and seek <strong>out-of-court settlements</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Greater Responsibility for VLOPs</strong></td>
<td>The law avoids a one-size-fits-all approach and places increased accountability on the <strong>Big Tech companies</strong>. Under the DSA, ‘Very Large Online Platforms’ (VLOPs) and ‘Very Large Online Search Engines’ (VLOSEs), that is platforms having more <strong>than 45 million users</strong> in the EU, will have more stringent requirements.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Direct Supervision by EC</strong></td>
<td>The European Commission will be responsible for centrally supervising these requirements and their enforcement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>More Transparency on Algorithms</strong></td>
<td>VLOPs and VLOSEs will face transparency <strong>measures and scrutiny of how their algorithms work,</strong> through <strong>systemic risk analysis</strong> and reduction to drive accountability about the social impacts of their products.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Clearer Identifiers for Ads</strong></td>
<td>Online platforms must ensure that <strong>users can easily identify advertisements and understand who presents or pays for the advertisement</strong>. They must <strong>not display personalised advertising</strong> directed towards minors or based on sensitive personal data.</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Definition</strong></td>
<td>Darwin’s theory of evolution is the process by which species of organisms develop and change over time through natural selection.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Principles</strong><br><br><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/homo.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/homo.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></td>
<td>·        <strong>Variation</strong>: Individuals within a species have differences or variations.<br><br>·        <strong>Inheritance</strong>: Some of these variations are heritable and can be passed on to <strong>offspring</strong>.<br><br>·        <strong>Selection</strong>: Organisms with advantageous variations have a higher chance of surviving and reproducing, passing on these advantageous traits to their offspring.<br><br>·        <strong>Time</strong>: Evolution occurs <strong>over long periods of time</strong>, allowing for gradual changes to accumulate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Natural Selection</strong></td>
<td>Natural selection is the driving force behind evolution. Organisms with <strong>advantageous traits are more likely to survive</strong> and reproduce, passing on those traits to their offspring. Over time, this leads to the evolution of new species.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Controversies</strong></td>
<td>Darwin’s theory of evolution has been controversial since its introduction. Some <strong>religious and cultural beliefs</strong> conflict with the idea of evolution.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Influence</strong></td>
<td><strong>Lamarck</strong>, the French naturalist proposed his own theory of evolution before Darwin; Darwin’s theory was an extension of <strong>laissez-faire economics</strong>; Darwin was greatly influenced by <strong>Malthus’ ideas of competition</strong> in an environment with limited resources.</td>
