<p><strong>Context:</strong> According to the <strong>United Nations Population Fund’s (UNFPA) State of World Population (SOWP)</strong> report 2023 <strong>– ‘8 Billion Lives, Infinite Possibilities’</strong> – <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/07/decoding-indias-population-conundrum/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20UN%20World,reach%201%2C428.6%20million%20in%202023.">India is now the most populous country</a> in the world.</p>

<tr>
<td><strong>Total</strong></td>
<td>The population of the world is <strong>8,045 million.</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>The largest share (age)</strong></td>
<td>Out of this, <strong>the largest share (65%) is of people between the ages of 15 – 64 years</strong>, followed by those in the 10-24 years group (24%).<br><br><strong>10% of the population is above 65 years of age</strong>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>The largest share (region)</strong></td>
<td>The world’s two most populous regions are <strong>Eastern and South-Eastern Asia</strong> [2.3 billion people – 29% of the global population]; and<br><br>Central and Southern Asia [2.1 billion – 26%].</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>The largest share (countries)</strong></td>
<td><strong>China and India</strong> accounted for the largest populations in these regions, with more than 1.4 billion each in 2022.</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>The outlook for population growth</strong></td>
<td>While numbers will continue to grow for several decades, the <strong>rate of global population growth has fallen</strong> (&lt;1% since 2020 compared to 5% in 1950).<br><br>This is largely due to <strong>declining fertility</strong> – around two-thirds of people live in areas with a total fertility rate <!--=**2.1** children per woman → **replacement fertility rate/zero-growth fertility rate.**<br--><br>It is <strong>international migration</strong> (due to war, and famines, among other reasons) that is now the driver of growth in many countries, <strong>with 281 million people living outside their country of birth in 2020.</strong><br><br><strong>South Asia clocks some of the highest emigration trends</strong>, with India seeing an estimated net outflow of 3.5 million between 2010 and 2021 (Pakistan has the highest net flow).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>What contributed to the global population growth?</strong></td>
<td><strong>Increasing life expectancy</strong> (among men – 71 years while among women – 76 years). This also means that parts of the world, such as Japan, have a rapidly ageing population.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Projections</strong></td>
<td>The global population could grow to around <strong>8.5 billion in 2030, 9.7 billion in 2050 and 10.4 billion in 2100.</strong><br><br><strong>Central and Southern Asia</strong> is expected to become the most populous region in the world by 2037.<br><br>More than half of the projected increase in global population up to 2050 will be concentrated in <strong>eight countries</strong> – Congo (DRC), Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines and Tanzania.<br><br>Once fertility rates drop in high-fertility regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, the <strong>global population will start to decline</strong>.</td>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: The Nagaland government, repealed the <strong>Nagaland Municipal Act of 2001,</strong> which included  <strong>33% reservation for women</strong> in urban local bodies, in the face of opposition from community-based organizations.</p>
<p><strong>Background of the Issue:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Nagaland is the only state</strong> in India where seats in Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) are not reserved for women, as mandated by the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/functions-and-responsibilities-of-the-union-and-the-states-issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure-devolution-of-powers-and-finances-up-to-local-levels-and-challenges-therein/devolution-of-powers-and-finances-up-to-local-levels-and-challenges-therein/74th-amendment-act-municipalities/#:~:text=All%20members%20of%20the%20municipality,the%20chairperson%20of%20a%20municipality"><strong>74th Amendment to the Constitution</strong></a>. The State government amended the <strong>2001 Municipal Act in 2006</strong> to include <strong>33% reservation</strong> for women, but this move <strong>faced strong opposition</strong>, leading to the <strong>indefinite postponement</strong> of ULB polls in 2009. Recently, the <strong>Supreme Court pressurized the Nagaland government</strong> to hold ULB polls, but now the government has repealed the Municipal Act 2001.</p>

<p><strong>C</strong><strong>ontext:</strong> Copying cutting-edge practices in hiring, specialisation and organisational structure from the Indian military will serve the Indian bureaucracy well.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Indian Civil Service exists to <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-economy-3/poverty-and-unemployment/poverty/"><strong>end poverty</strong></a><strong>.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The war on poverty is won by raising the productivity</strong> of five physical and conceptual places – states, cities, sectors, firms, and skills.</li>
<li><strong>India’s strategy for reducing poverty:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Generating high-paying jobs</strong> through urbanisation, formalisation, industrialisation, financialisation and human capital.</li>
<li>To implement this <strong>India has new policy weapons</strong> like GST, IBC, MPC, UPI, DBT, FDI, PLI, NEP, EODB, privatisation, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What sabotages the public service outcomes that reduce poverty?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The government had an <strong>execution deficit,</strong></li>
<li>The private sector had a <strong>trust deficit</strong>,</li>
<li>Nonprofits had a <strong>scale deficit</strong>, and</li>
<li><strong>A dysfunctional Human Resources (HR) regime</strong> for civil servants.</li>

<tr>
<td><strong>Hiring</strong> (fixed terms for successful candidates)</td>
<td><strong>Tenure: The courageous Agniveer revamp</strong>: Only 25% of the recruited soldiers stayed on after a fixed duty. It will gradually <strong>raise military capital expenditure</strong>.<br><br>The government must hire all new civil servants for a <strong>fixed 10-year tenure</strong> with rollover percentages decided by a hard-coded organisational structure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Specialisation</strong> (compounding skills over decades)</td>
<td>A democracy’s generalists are politicians, while <strong>civil servants are technocrats whose mandate changed from ruling to governing</strong>.<br><br>Young military recruits pick an area of expertise early, the Indian civil services must replicate this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Structure</strong> (performance management forced via a frozen pyramid)</td>
<td>Civil servant selection is <strong>highly meritocratic,</strong> but their careers are adversely influenced by <strong>outdated HR practices that don’t punish bad performers</strong> and therefore punish good performers.<br><br>The performance management system in the military (promotions with honest appraisals) has been more disciplined.</td>

<p><strong>How will this transform</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/governance/role-of-civil-service-in-a-democracy/"><strong>Indian civil services</strong></a><strong>?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The Indian Republic has greatly benefitted from civilian control of the military, but it’s time for the civil services to learn three cutting-edge HR practices from the military.</li>
<li>Better HR practices in civil services are needed because <strong>wars are fought with weapons but won by people.</strong></li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Supreme Court issued notices to five tyre companies and the industry body Automotive Tyre Manufacturers’ Association (ATMA).</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The All-India Tyre Dealers Federation (AITDF) in a reference to the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) alleged 5 tyre companies for coordination<strong>, price parallelism and</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/09/27/competition-commission-of-india-and-cartelisation/"><strong>cartelisation</strong></a>.</li>
<li>These companies (control 90% of the tyre production in India) had <strong>raised tyre prices on the pretext of rising prices of raw materials</strong> (natural rubber).</li>
<li>However, they did not correspondingly decrease prices when raw material prices fell – <strong>not in line with typical competitive market practices</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>The Competition Commission of India</strong> (CCI) – the competition regulator, imposed penalties on the five tyre companies (MRF, JK Tyre, Apollo, CEAT and Birla Tyres) alongside ATMA.</li>
<li>The order was challenged at the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) and was <strong>overturned</strong>.</li>
<li>Now, CCI has approached the apex court challenging the tribunal’s order.</li>

<tr>
<td><strong>Meaning</strong></td>
<td>According to CCI, <strong>cartelisation is a practice in which a group of competitors (manufacturers, sellers, distributors) come together (agreement) to restrict competition.</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Ill-Effects</strong></td>
<td>Reduces the output → <strong>increases the price</strong> → Forces consumers out of the market (if they opt not to pay a higher price) → transferring wealth unknowingly (if they opt to pay)<br><br>A cartel protects its members from full market exposure → decreasing cost control → <strong>hurting overall economic performance and innovation.</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Cartels vs monopoly</strong></td>
<td>A monopolist dominates the concerned market completely (as there is no competitor), while cartels are formed (with the intention to restrict competition) to dominate the market</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Laws to stop cartelisation</strong></td>
<td><strong>The Competition Act, 2002</strong> seeks <strong>to promote and sustain competition</strong> in markets, protect the interest of consumers, and ensure freedom of trade for market participants.<br><br>It established the <strong>CCI</strong> to eliminate practices having adverse effects on market competition.</td>

<p>Ten years ago, on April 18, 2013, the <strong>Dongoria Kondhs</strong>, a vulnerable tribal group in India, won a landmark legal battle in the Supreme Court against Vedanta Company’s plans to <strong>exploit the Niyamgiri Hill for bauxite</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>What did the court say?</strong></p>
<p>The court recognized the <strong>cultural, religious, and spiritual rights</strong> of the tribe on the hill and gave the Gram Sabha the authority to <strong>examine possible infringements</strong> on their rights due to the proposed project. The Supreme Court <strong>ordered a referendum</strong> to be held amongst the affected Gram Sabhas to obtain consent on the project from the community, which unanimously voted against it.</p>
<p>The referendum resulted in a <strong>rare registration of the Dongoria Kondhs’ claim for sovereignty, self-determination, and territorial autonomy.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Usage</strong>: Niyamgiri case today serves as a <strong>textbook example of good usage of Free, Prior Informed Consent (FPIC),</strong> for any environmental projects. The case can be a quote in an Essay/Ethics/ Environment question.</p>

<p><strong>About Quantum Computing:</strong></p>
<p>Quantum computing is a new way of <strong>computing that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations</strong>. In traditional computing, data is processed using bits, which are either a 0 or a 1. But in quantum computing, the data is processed using quantum bits or qubits, which can be both a 0 and a 1 at the same time. This property of qubits is called superposition, which allows for multiple calculations to be performed simultaneously, making quantum computing exponentially faster than traditional computing for certain types of problems.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The tea mosquito bug (Helopeltis Theivora) is spreading rapidly and affecting tea production in both low and high-elevation plantations in Southern India</p>
<p><strong>About the Bug:</strong></p>
<p>It is a major sucking pest of tea <strong>(Camellia sinensis L.)</strong> in most tea-producing countries. The nymphs and adults of the TMB suck the sap from tender leaves, buds and young shoots, which results in heavy crop losses.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/spider.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/spider.jpg?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Prevention</strong>: It can be controlled by using synthetic pesticides. However, the 2014 Plant Protection Code (PPC) from the Tea Board of India restricts the use of harmful pesticides to keep the tea safe and free from harmful pesticides</p>
<p><strong>India’s status of Tea:</strong></p>
<p>India is the <strong>second highest producer of tea</strong> (China is the largest producer and consumer of tea) in the world and makes up over <strong>12 per cent</strong> of world exports.</p>
