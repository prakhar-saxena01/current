<h4 id="gs-paper-3"><strong>GS Paper 3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Infrastructure (Railways)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/odisha-accident-senior-official-had-alerted-railway-on-serious-flaws-in-signalling-system/article66930016.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The tragic Odisha train accident that resulted in the death of over 288 passengers has brought into sharp focus the safety mechanisms needed to prevent such tragedies.</p>
<p><strong>Why do train accidents happen in India?</strong> </p>
<p><strong>The Performance Audit on Derailment in Indian Railways – a CAG (2022) report</strong> ascertains whether measures to prevent derailments and collisions were clearly laid down and implemented. </p>
<p><strong>Findings in the CAG audit report:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The main reason</strong> behind train accidents in India is<ul>
<li><strong>For example</strong>, out of 217 “consequential train accidents” – that have serious repercussions in terms of either loss of human life/injury or loss of Railway property/traffic interruption, 163 (75%) were due to derailments during 2017-18 to 2020-21.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Factors responsible for derailments</strong> are maintenance of tracks, deviation of track parameters beyond permissible limits, bad driving and overspeeding, and faulty signalling system (suspected cause of the Odisha train accident). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Some initiatives of the Indian govt. to prevent train accidents:</strong></p>
<p><strong>The KAVACH:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is an <strong>indigenously</strong> developed Automatic Train Protection (<strong>ATP</strong>) system by the Research Design and Standards Organisation (<strong>RDSO</strong>) in collaboration with the Indian industry.</li>
<li><strong>It provides protection</strong> by preventing trains from passing the signal at Red and <strong>activates the train’s braking system automatically</strong> (if the driver jumps the Red signal) and avoids collision.</li>
<li><strong>The Traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS)</strong> helps in two-way communication between the station master and loco-pilot to convey any emergency message.</li>
<li>Both the Shalimar-Chennai Coromandel Express and the Yeshwanthpur-Howrah Express were <strong>not fitted with KAVACH-TCAS</strong>. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The</strong> <strong>Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh (RRSK):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It was <strong>created in 2017-18 with a corpus of Rs 1 lakh crore</strong> over a period of five years with an annual outlay of Rs 20,000 crore – Rs 15,000 crore of budgetary support and Rs 5,000 crore from Railways internal resources).</li>
<li><strong>The safety fund will be used for</strong> improved inspection and safety work at level crossing, track repair, bridge restoration, rolling stock replacement, human resource development, etc.</li>
<li><strong>The number of funds allocated for track renewal projects decreased</strong> from Rs 9,607.65 crore (2018-19) to Rs 7,417 crore (2019-20), and even this amount was <strong>not “fully utilised”.</strong></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Civil society</strong> must play a critical role in sustaining biodiversity.</li>
<li><strong>A paradigm shift in the care of biodiversity.</strong><ul>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> the main custodian of the natural world in India is the <strong>Indian Forest Service.</strong></li>
<li>Therefore, a <strong>multifunctional landscapes approach</strong>, with the <strong>direct participation of local communities</strong> is the need of the hour.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Some best practices from India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Forest Rights Act 2006:</strong> It calls for an increase in the stake of indigenous groups in ownership as well as management of biodiversity. However, the Act largely remains on paper.</li>
<li><strong>National Mission on Biodiversity and Human Wellbeing:</strong> It is a proposed mission (<strong>India’s Biodiversity Collaborative</strong> based in Bengaluru, conceptualised the idea) to have all citizens engaged in the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> It is time to decentralise the management of biodiversity by bringing together multiple stakeholders, especially local communities, through gram sabhas and biodiversity management committees.</p>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/explained-economics-oil-reserves-in-salt-caverns-8643242/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Government-owned engineering consultancy firm Engineers India (EIL) is studying the <strong>prospects and feasibility of developing salt cavern-based strategic oil reserves in Rajasthan</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is in line with the <strong>government’s objective of increasing the country’s strategic oil storage capacity.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The country’s three existing <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/11/24/strategic-petroleum-reserves-spr-programme-2/">strategic oil storage</a> facilities — <strong>at Mangaluru and Padur in Karnataka, and Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh</strong> — are made up of excavated rock caverns.</p>
<p><strong>About Strategic Oil Reserves:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A strategic oil reserve refers to a stockpile of crude oil or petroleum products that a country maintains as a strategic <strong>measure to ensure energy security and stability in times of emergencies or disruptions in oil supply.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The International Energy Agency (IEA)</strong> recommends that all countries maintain emergency oil <strong>stockpiles equivalent to 90 days of import protection.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Statistics about Oil Reserves In India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>India, the <strong>world’s third-largest consumer of crude, depends on imports for more than 85% of its requirement</strong>.</li>
<li>India currently has an <strong>SPR capacity of 5.33 million tonnes or around 39 million barrels of crude</strong>. India’s strategic petroleum reserves (SPR) currently <strong>provide around 9.5 days of oil requirement coverage.</strong></li>
<li>Additionally, oil marketing companies in India have their storage facilities, providing an additional 64.5 days of storage, totalling <strong>approximately 74 days of petroleum demand coverage.</strong></li>
<li>India’s strategic crude oil storages are currently located at <strong>Visakhapatnam</strong> (Andhra Pradesh), <strong>Mangaluru</strong> (Karnataka), <strong>Padur</strong> (Karnataka) and <strong>Chandikhol in Odisha.</strong></li>
<li>The construction of the <strong>Strategic Crude Oil Storage facilities</strong>in India is being managed by <strong>Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserves Limited (ISPRL) (a</strong> wholly owned subsidiary of Oil Industry Development Board (OIDB) under the Ministry of Petroleum &amp; Natural Gas).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Underground storage</strong></p>
<p>It is, by far the most <strong>economical method of storing petroleum products</strong> because the underground facility <strong>rules out the requirement of large swathes of land</strong>, ensures less evaporation and, since the caverns are built much below the sea level, it is easy to <strong>discharge crude into them from ships.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Two types of underground reserves:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-65602519"><strong>BBC</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Solar panels, hailed as a crucial tool in reducing carbon emissions, face the challenge of disposal and replacement as they only <strong>last up to 25 years.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is Solar E-Waste?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/31/how-to-manage-indias-solar-pv-waste-problem/">Solar e-waste</a> refers to the electronic waste generated by discarded solar panels. As solar panels have a limited <strong>lifespan of 20-25 years</strong>, their disposal raises concerns about managing the electronic waste they create.</p>
<p><strong>What does Solar Panel consist of?</strong></p>
<p>A PV module is essentially made up of <strong>glass, metal, silicon and polymer fractions</strong>. Glass and aluminium, together constituting <strong>around 80% of total weight</strong>, are <strong>non-hazardous.</strong></p>
<p>But a few other materials used including <strong>polymers, metals, metallic compounds and alloys</strong> are classified as <strong>potentially hazardous</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Status:</strong></p>
<ul>

<td><strong>Adverse Possession</strong></td>
<td>It refers to the <strong>hostile possession of the property</strong>, where a person can become the <strong>owner of the land if they possess it openly and continuously</strong> for a specified period of time. The concept stems from the idea that <strong>land must not be left vacant but instead, be put to judicious use.</strong></td>

<p><strong>What are Payment System Operators (PSOs)?</strong></p>
<p>Payment System Operators (PSOs) are entities that facilitate the movement of funds between payers and payees in electronic payment systems. They provide the necessary infrastructure and technology to enable various payment transactions, such as online payments, card payments, mobile payments, and electronic fund transfers.</p>
<p><strong>Examples: P</strong>opular PSOs like <strong>PayPal, RuPay, Visa, Mastercard, and Paytm</strong> act as intermediaries in processing and settling payments between buyers and sellers in online transactions.</p>
<p><strong>About the guidelines:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The proposed guidelines require PSOs to <strong>implement inventory management</strong>, approved cybersecurity measures, and crisis management plans, and comply with Basel standards.</li>
<li>PSOs will have to <strong>report any unusual incident</strong> including those involving cyber-attacks, internal fraud etc. to RBI <strong>within six hours of detection</strong>.</li>
<li>Provisions of these directions shall apply to <strong>all authorised non-bank PSOs</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>The Board of PSOs</strong> has been made responsible for ensuring adequate oversight over information</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Aim of the guidelines:</strong> These measures are intended to <strong>improve cyber safety and protect digital payment systems.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The World Health Organization (WHO) has released <strong>new guidelines to protect children from the harmful effects</strong> of food marketing that promotes unhealthy dietary choices.</p>
<p><strong>Need for the guidelines:</strong></p>
<p>In 2017, to understand the linkages between food and NCDs, the Delhi-based think tank Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) conducted the <a href="http://cdn.cseindia.org/attachments/0.37055100_1520598445_burden-packaged-food-school-children.pdf">Know your diet — school children survey</a>. The survey found that</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Most schoolchildren were not eating a balanced diet</strong></li>
<li>Children had a low frequency of intake of cereals, vegetables and millet</li>
<li><strong>Packaged food was more popular</strong> among children than non-packaged food</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Previous guidelines:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2010 WHO <a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241500210">‘Set of recommendations on the marketing of foods and non-alcoholic beverages to children</a></li>
