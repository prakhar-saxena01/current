<h4 id="gs-paper-1"><strong>GS Paper 1</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Population and Associated Issues</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/india-china-demographic-dividend-and-unemployment-problems-8651054/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The current median Indian age of 28, as compared to China’s 39, suggests that India will continue to enjoy its demographic advantage up to the end of this century.</p>
<p><strong>Case of China:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>China’s youth population was declining</strong> and the ageing population was rising.</li>
<li>In 2023, <strong>~12 million students in China</strong> are expected to graduate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges faced by China:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>China is facing a new kind of epidemic: <strong>joblessness</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>The job market was</strong> hit hard by the Covid-19 lockdowns and massive layoffs in key sectors such as real estate, tech, and education.</li>
<li>Growing demand for job security and <strong>lack of employment opportunities</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What went wrong with China’s job market? The country’s growth was hit hard</strong> during the Zero-Covid three years.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario in India:</strong> Poor education, joblessness and a shortage of skilled personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Undocumented migration.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The increasing rate of crimes:</strong> India has become a hub for internet-based scams.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What went wrong in India?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2,500+ Industrial Training Institutes:</strong> Established in the 1960s and run by state governments, have failed to update their skilling courses.</li>
<li><strong>The National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC):</strong> Created in 2003, NSDC’s short-duration courses (&lt;1 year) are <strong>insufficient for real skill acquisition.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Sub-standard engineering colleges:</strong> Mostly function as money-making enterprises, giving inadequate training.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and jobs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The NEP 2020 introduced vocational training</strong> for 6th, 7th and 8th-grade students to improve their skills in a particular field.</li>
<li><strong>This has to continue at the secondary level</strong>, with vocation-focused schools.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are the solutions?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Job creation</strong> is the topmost priority.</li>
<li><strong>Skilling</strong>, to effective outcome levels, should be the constant goal.</li>
<li><strong>The NEP vision</strong> should lead to a different kind of high school that continue with skilling training.</li>
<li><strong>MSMEs</strong> should be further incentivised as the major employment creators.</li>
<li><strong>India must add to its inherent IT capabilities</strong> without neglecting the manufacturing sector.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best practice – The German model of skill development:</strong> It comprised two strictly separate sectors: the higher education system and the system of dual (at the company level and classes at a vocational school) vocational education and training.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Currently, India is taking minimal benefits of demographic dividends. In order to take full benefits of demographic dividends, high-quality jobs need to be created and highly skilled youths need to fill these jobs.</p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-2"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Important aspects of governance, transparency and accountability, institutions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/from-artists-to-lawmakers-8649343/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> In a representative democracy, the role of citizens is very critical.</p>
<p><strong>Representative vs direct democracy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In a representative democracy, people vote for representatives who then vote on policy initiatives.</li>
<li>In a direct democracy, people vote on policy initiatives directly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Basic principles of representative democracy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Equality of all citizens before the law.</li>
<li>Free and fair elections.</li>
<li><strong>Principle of popular sovereignty:</strong> Popular sovereignty is the principle of majority rule being used to carry out the political will of the people.</li>
<li><strong>Political liberty:</strong> This idea holds that people are free to enjoy fundamental liberties such as freedom of expression, assembly, movement, and thought.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>India’s representative democracy:</strong> It is one of the largest and most complex in the world, where <strong>elected representatives constitute</strong> its federal democratic ethos – representing the aspirations of their electorate.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges faced by Indian representative democracy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increasing ideological divisions</strong> among political parties and their supporters.</li>
<li>The spirit of consensus building is undermined, <strong>hampering constructive debates and resulting in policy</strong> <strong>paralysis</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Corruption in governance and personal values</strong> erodes individual trust in institutions.</li>
<li>The role of <strong>money power in elections, identity politics, and inequitable opportunities</strong> is hindering citizens’ right to ethical representation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reforming representative democracy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increasing people’s participation:</strong> To transform representative democracy to participatory democracy to foster greater “democratisation” of political life.<ul>
<li><strong>For example</strong>, Gram Sabha [Article 243 (b)].</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Strengthening federal democracy</strong>: Decentralising power and empowering local governments can enhance accountability and promote citizen participation in matters of national importance.<ul>
<li><strong>For example</strong>, the 73rd and 74th Amendments to the Indian Constitution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The National Legislators Conference (NLC):</strong><ul>
<li>It is a pioneering initiative bringing together 4,000 MLAs and MLCs from all political parties under one roof.</li>
<li>The 3-day boot camp is an <strong>opportunity to exchange notes across ideological lines, presenting case studies of best practices and governance</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best practice – Switzerland:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Direct democracy</strong> is one of the special features of the Swiss political system.</li>
<li>It is underpinned by two instruments: <strong>initiatives</strong> (to propose constitutional amendments or legislative enactment) and <strong>referendums</strong> (to express their opinion on decisions taken by the Swiss Parliament).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Explore the possibility of the <strong>right to recall inefficient and corrupt politicians</strong>.</li>
<li>Strengthen <strong>RTI and protect whistleblowers</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Leveraging technology to improve governance</strong>. With nearly 60% internet penetration in India and 600 million smartphone users, the legislators have an opportunity to reach out to the electorates.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Citizens have a very important role in a representative democracy as they exercise their rights and freedoms and benefit from the democratic setup of the country.</p>

<td>The NEP 2020 is a policy document outlining a series of reforms to be <strong>pursued in education till 2040</strong>. India has had three policies to date.<br><br>The NEP 2020 proposes vital shifts — <strong>from creating a system in which “children not only learn but more importantly learn how to learn</strong>” to one in which <strong>“pedagogy must evolve to make education more experiential, inquiry-driven, flexible</strong>” and in which there is “<strong>no hard separation between arts and sciences”.</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>National Curriculum Framework</strong></td>
<td>The <strong>National Curriculum Framework (NCF),</strong> is a crucial policy document for <strong>revising textbooks and classroom pedagogy</strong>. Among its key recommendations are <strong>conducting board examinations twice a year, creating a semester system for Class 12 students, and providing students with the freedom to pursue a combination of science and humanities</strong>, aiming to reduce the rigid boundaries between arts, commerce, and science in classes 11 and 12 across all school boards.</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>School Textbooks</strong></td>
<td>The National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT), the apex body advising the Centre on school education, has <strong>three rounds of revisions in school textbooks.</strong></td>

<tr>
<td><strong>New Institutions, Enhanced Capacity</strong></td>
<td>In addition to the <strong>new centrally-run educational institutions (including 7 IITs, 7 IIMs, 16 IIITs, and 15 AIIMS</strong> of which 12 are partially or fully functional) set up in the last nine years, <strong>there was a significant capacity enhancement of existing institutions by way of the EWS quota.</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Female representation</strong></td>
<td>The supernumerary seats were introduced for women at IITs and NITs in 2018, resulting in a <strong>rise in female representation from 9% in 2017 to 20% in 2022</strong> at IITs over five years.<br><br>According to AISHE data, there <strong>has been a reduction in gender disparity in higher education enrolment since 2014.</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Other significant changes and initiatives in education</strong></td>
<td>The no-detention policy under the Right to Education Act 2009, which guaranteed promotion through Class 1 to 8, <strong>was scrapped in 2019</strong>.<br><br>A <strong>single agency to conduct all entrance tests to higher education</strong>, the National Testing Agency, was set up in 2017.<br><br>In a bid to end “inspector raj” and dismantle lobbies, the country’s apex medical education body, the Medical Commission of India, was dissolved in September 2020 and replaced with a new body – <strong>National Medical Commission.</strong><br><br><strong>The Higher Education Financing Agency or HEFA was set up in 2017</strong> to leverage funds from the market to finance infrastructure development in educational institutions through long-term loans.</td>

<li><strong>Resilience</strong> is the capacity of a system to dynamically respond to, recover from and even thrive in changing climate conditions while maintaining essential functions, identities and structures.</li>
<li>Hence, CRA is an approach of <strong>sustainably using existing natural resources</strong> to achieve long-term higher productivity and farm incomes under climate variabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Need:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Extreme weather events</strong> → reducing farm produce, food price fluctuations → endangering food security and farm incomes.</li>
<li>Hence, to address climate change and achieve SDGs, <strong>adaptation of appropriate mitigation technologies is required.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Outcomes of CRA:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved access and utilisation of technology,</li>
<li>Increased use of resources conservation technologies,</li>
<li>An increased adaptation of crops and livestock to climatic stress,</li>
<li><strong>Reduces hunger and poverty</strong> (by sustaining agricultural production).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Strategies and technologies for climate change adaptation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tolerant crops:</strong> For example, <strong>early maturing and drought-tolerant</strong> green gram (BM 2002-1) was introduced by farmers in Aurangabad (MH).</li>
<li><strong>Tolerant breeds in livestock and poultry:</strong> Indigenous breeds are resistant to droughts, ability to ingest and digest low-quality feed, and resistance to diseases.</li>
<li><strong>Feed management:</strong> An adaptation measure, which can indirectly improve the efficiency of livestock production.</li>
<li><strong>Water management/Water-smart technologies:</strong> Like micro-irrigation, cover-crop method, deficit irrigation, precision estimation of crop water needs, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Agro-advisory:</strong> Response farming (farming with advisories) is an integrative approach already been taken in states like Tamil Nadu.</li>
<li><strong>Soil organic carbon:</strong> Different farm management practices –<ul>
<li>Conservation agriculture technologies (reduced tillage, crop rotations, and cover crops),</li>
<li>Soil conservation practices (contour farming) and</li>
<li>Nutrient recharge strategies – can increase soil carbon stocks and stimulate soil functional stability.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What is deconstruction theory?</strong></p>
<p>Deconstruction theory is a <strong>way of looking at language and meaning</strong> that challenges the idea that words have fixed clear meanings. It suggests that meaning is not stable and can change depending on the context.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation using an example:</strong></p>
<p>Imagine you have a word like “<strong>cat</strong>.” In the traditional understanding, “cat” refers to a specific <strong>animal with fur, whiskers, and a tail</strong>. But deconstruction theory questions this idea. It asks, what if the word “cat” doesn’t have a fixed meaning? What if its meaning is influenced by other words and concepts?</p>
<p>For example, <strong>think about the word “dog.”</strong> The meaning of “cat” is not just about what a cat is, but also how it’s different from a dog. The meaning of “cat” depends on the <strong>differences between cats and dogs.</strong> This shows that meaning is not inherent in the word itself, but is created through relationships with other words and concepts.</p>
<p><strong>Deconstruction theory</strong>, introduced by <strong>Jacques Derrida</strong>, has had a significant impact beyond literary criticism, influencing disciplines such as <strong>anthropology, sociology, psychoanalysis, feminism, queer theory, art, and architecture.</strong></p>
<p><strong>U</strong><strong>sage</strong>: It can be used in Essay/Sociology/Anthropology Answer writings.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The <strong>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</strong> is <strong>cracking down on cryptocurrency exchanges.</strong> The SEC filed over <strong>a dozen charges against Binance</strong>, alleging the exchange commingled billions of dollars of investors’ funds and routed them to a company in Europe.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>regulator claimed that Binance allowed high-value U.S. customers to access its international platform, misled investors</strong> about trading controls, and commingled customer funds.</li>
</ul>
<p>The SEC has <strong>been pushing for crypto businesses and trading platforms to register with the regulator for investor protection and transparency</strong>. However, industry leaders have been cautious about negotiating with the SEC due to its history of legal action against cryptocurrency companies. <strong>The SEC’s aim seems to be bringing crypto exchanges under U.S. securities law.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Its Impact:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The SEC’s actions against Binance may <strong>unsettle U.S.-based crypto traders who use its services and want to invest legally</strong>.</li>
<li>These events <strong>could have an impact on the cryptocurrency market</strong>, which is highly sensitive to regulatory news. Following the <strong>SEC’s lawsuit against Binance, the prices of Bitcoin and Ether, two major cryptocurrencies, experienced declines.</strong></li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) has issued an alert on rising ozone pollution and multi-pollutant crisis in the national capital on World Environment Day 2023 (June 5).</p>
<p><strong>World Environment Day (WED):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is celebrated <strong>annually on 5 June</strong> and encourages awareness and action for the protection of the environment.</li>
<li>It was <strong>established in 1972</strong> by the UN at the Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment. <strong>In 1973,</strong> the first WED was held with the theme “Only One Earth”.</li>
<li><strong>WED 2023</strong> is hosted by <strong>Côte d’Ivoire</strong> in partnership with the Netherlands with the theme <strong>#BeatPlasticPollution.</strong></li>

<td><strong>Ground-level ozone</strong></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Meaning</strong></td>
<td>Also known as tropospheric ozone, it is a colourless and highly irritating gas that forms just above (up to 2 miles) the Earth’s surface.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Classification</strong></td>
<td><strong>It is a “secondary” pollutant</strong> (not directly emitted into the air). It is produced when two primary pollutants [nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs)] react in sunlight and stagnant air.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>How are NOx and VOCs formed?</strong></td>
<td><strong>NOx and VOCs come from natural sources as well as human activities.</strong> About 95% of NOx comes from the burning of coal, gasoline and oil in motor vehicles, etc. VOCs come mainly from gasoline production and combustion, residential wood combustion, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Harmful effects</strong></td>
<td><strong>On human health:</strong> As ground-level ozone is a highly reactive gas, it has serious health consequences. This can inflame and damage airways, make lungs susceptible to infection, and aggravate asthma, and chronic bronchitis leading to increased hospitalisation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>On ecosystems</strong>: It can harm sensitive vegetation and forests, parks and wildlife refuges.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>The situation in India (2020 State of Global Air Report)</strong></td>
<td>Ozone is emerging as a serious public health issue in India (<strong>17%↑</strong> between 2010 and 2017). Age-standardised rates of death attributable to ground-level ozone are among the highest in India.</td>
</tr>

<p><strong>Highlights of the CSE analysis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ground-level ozone usually <strong>exceeds the safety standard</strong> (50 ppb over an 8-hour average) on all summer days in some locations in Delhi-NCR every year.</li>
<li>Ground-level ozone, which should ideally become negligible in the night air, <strong>remains a problem at night too in the Delhi-NCR region.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Even winter months</strong> (winter can inhibit the formation of ground-level ozone) in Delhi-NCR face excess ozone levels, <strong>making it an all-year problem</strong>.</li>
