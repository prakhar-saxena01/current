<h4 id="gs-paper-2"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>International Relations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/india-us-defence-deal-pm-modi-joe-biden-china-8649345/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The geopolitical turmoil in Asia as a result of China’s rise will be a crucial background for the Indian PM’s discussions with the US President, as he travels to the US for a state visit.</p>
<p><strong>US-China conflict:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The 20th edition of the <strong>annual Shangri-La Dialogue (SLD) in Singapore</strong> highlighted the deepening tensions between the US and China.</li>
<li>Since its inception in <strong>2002</strong>, the SLD has become the premium forum where defence ministers of Asia gather to <strong>publicly articulate their positions on regional security</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>USA’s Indo-Pacific strategy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Despite the continuing crises in the Middle East and a major war in Europe, Washington has repeatedly reaffirmed that the <strong>Indo-Pacific remains the highest priority.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Removing the Asian fear</strong> by explicitly challenging China’s claim to regional hegemony has been at the core of the <strong>US Indo-Pacific strategy.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/indo.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/indo.png" /></a></strong> </p>
<p><strong>USA approach towards China:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>National actions include <strong>measures for control of technology exports to China</strong> and growing military support for Taiwan.</li>
<li>The US is <strong>mobilising a broad-based coalition</strong> to balance China. <strong>For example,</strong> it has drawn (the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada) into the grand regional coalition.</li>
<li>On the other hand, the US is <strong>resuming high-level talks</strong> on confidence-building measures to prevent the tensions from escalating.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>China’s position:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>China is unwilling to accept the US terms of engagement and sees USA’s persistent call for high-level dialogue as a <strong>trap</strong>.</li>
<li>China criticises the resurgent “<strong>cold war mentality</strong>” and demands that “<strong>mutual respect should prevail over bullying and hegemony</strong>”.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Where do Asian countries stand?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>China has been <strong>grabbing disputed territories</strong> from its neighbours and it is the US that is offering help to defend territorial sovereignty in Asia.</li>
<li>Many Asian nations have <strong>stepped up political and military engagement</strong> [Quad, AUKUS, trilateral coordination with Seoul and Tokyo, <strong>a local quad</strong> (Australia, Japan, Philippines)] with the US despite Chinese warnings.</li>
<li><strong>Yet, there is a reluctance in the region</strong> to jeopardise the deep economic relationship with Beijing and a deliberate effort to <strong>avoid politically offending China</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>India and Japan in USA’s Strategy to Contain China:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Japan:</strong> The US has been encouraging Japan too –<ul>
<li>Raise its military capabilities,</li>
<li>Modernising the military alliance with South Korea,</li>
<li>Revitalising military partnership with Manila and</li>
<li>Enhancing security cooperation with Indonesia.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>India:</strong> Building a <strong>stronger strategic partnership with India</strong> has been a high priority for the Biden administration.<ul>
<li>The shared interests in <strong>stabilising the Asian balance of power</strong> are objective realities demanding a solid India-US defence partnership.</li>
<li>Currently, both are in talks for a <strong>significant elevation of bilateral defence cooperation</strong>, including technology transfers and joint defence industrial production.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The USA’s recent approach towards China is seen as an attempt <strong>to reverse the dominant perception</strong> that China’s domination of Asia is inevitable and America’s retreat is irreversible.</li>
<li>It is trying to build a ‘<strong>New Asia</strong>’, where a US-led coalition will be the real hegemon.</li>

<p><strong>Syllabus</strong><strong>: Economy – Tourism</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/india-could-learn-from-thailand-how-to-boost-tourism-11686157728130.html"><strong>LM</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Thailand is known for its tourism. This article highlights <strong>lessons that can be incorporated by India to boost its tourism sector.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Initiatives by Thailand:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Introducing <strong>visa-free travel for G20 countries and Southeast Asian neighbours</strong>, as Thailand does, to attract more foreign tourists.</li>
<li>Thailand’s ability to <strong>respond quickly to changes in the tourism industry,</strong> as demonstrated by their <strong>decision to eliminate the Thailand Pass requirement, boosted tourist arrivals.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Statistics of Tourism in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Attracted only <strong>11 million tourists in 2019</strong>.</li>
<li>India’s Tourism is ranked <strong>10th position in terms of its contribution to World GDP</strong> (Gross Domestic Product) in the <strong>World Travel and Tourism Council’s report in 2019.</strong></li>
<li>During 2019, the <strong>contribution of travel &amp; tourism to GDP was 6.8% of the total economy</strong>.</li>
<li>In FY20, the tourism sector in India accounted for <strong>39 million jobs, which was 8.0% of the total employment in the country.</strong>By 2029, it is expected to account for about 53 million jobs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples from Thailand:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The presence of <strong>street food options in a luxurious shopping mall</strong>, where tourists can <strong>order using QR codes and receive VAT refunds</strong>. The affordability of the food contrasts with the expensive fashion brands available upstairs.</li>
<li>Increasing <strong>vegan and vegetarian options to attract</strong> more Indian tourists.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> India’s rubber industry is facing challenges as production falls behind growing demand.</p>
<p><strong>About Rubber:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/rubber.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/rubber.png" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Status of the Rubber Industry:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>History</strong>: The first rubber plantations in India were set up in <strong>1895 on the hill slopes of Kerala</strong>. However, rubber cultivation on a commercial scale was introduced in 1902.</li>
<li><strong>Distribution:</strong> <strong>Kerala (the</strong> largest producer of natural rubber in India); <strong>Tamil Nadu;</strong> Karnataka; Tripura, Assam, Andaman and Nicobar, Goa etc are some other rubber-producing States.</li>
<li><strong>Natural rubber is preferred over synthetic rubber</strong>due to its <strong>high tensile strength</strong> and <strong>vibration-dampening properties</strong>, along with tear resistance. This makes it important for the <strong>construction and automobile industries</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<td><strong>Examples</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Falling rubber prices</strong></td>
<td>Prices have plunged from a peak of <strong>540 cents/kg in 2011 to 130 cents/kg in recent years</strong>, discouraging rubber producers and leading to the abandonment of plantations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>High labour costs</strong></td>
<td><strong>Labour-intensive activities like tapping rubber trees</strong> require skilled workers, but paying for labour amid falling prices has made rubber plantations financially unattractive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Import competition</strong></td>
<td>Imports of rubber, usually available at lower prices than the domestic market, <strong>drive down prices and further discourage domestic production</strong>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Production-consumption gap</strong></td>
<td>The demand for natural rubber in India, primarily driven by the tire industry, has surged, creating a significant gap between production and consumption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Climate change</strong></td>
<td>Changing weather conditions, influenced by climate change, pose challenges to rubber farming, particularly in traditional cultivation areas like Kerala.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Lack of technological adoption</strong></td>
<td>Limited adoption of technological advancements in the industry hinders <strong>productivity and competitiveness.</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Land conversion and fragmentation</strong></td>
<td>Instead of finding ways to increase production, some rubber plantations are being <strong>sold or converted for other purposes, leading to the fragmentation of rubber holdings.</strong></td>

<p>Dr M. Emperumal Naidu, a <strong>prominent doctor and figure in the freedom movement and the Vaikom temple street entry movement</strong>, played a significant role in advocating for social justice and temple entry for all in Vaikom.

<p>Manoj Misra (a former Indian Forest Service officer), the defender of Yamuna and other rivers, passed away after battling Covid-19. As a forester, he dedicated himself to <strong>river protection and rejuvenation</strong>. His efforts led to significant legal and policy changes, including the <strong>Nirmal Yamuna Rejuvenation plan</strong> and <strong>drafting legislation</strong> for river regulation (E.g., River Regulation Zones). He advocated against destructive interventions on rivers and promoted the <strong>idea of river basins as units of developmental planning</strong>. Manoj was a vocal critic of projects like the Ken-Betwa river linking, Riverfront developments, and hydro-power projects in the Himalayas, and worked to raise awareness about their environmental impact.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> A cyclonic storm, <strong>named Biparjoy</strong>, has developed in the <strong>Arabian Sea.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>‘Biparjoy’ was <strong>suggested by Bangladesh</strong> and the word <strong>means ‘disaster’ or ‘calamity’ in Bengali</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Cyclones:</strong></p>
<p>A <strong>cyclone is a low-pressure system that forms over warm waters</strong>. Usually, a high temperature anywhere means the <strong>existence of low-pressure air, and a low temperature means high-pressure wind</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>How are cyclones named?</strong></p>
<p>The naming of <strong>cyclones is done by countries on a rotational basis</strong>, following certain existing guidelines.</p>
<ul>
<li>Worldwide, there are <strong>six regional specialised meteorological centres (RSMCs) and five regional Tropical Cyclone Warning Centres (TCWCs)</strong> mandated for issuing advisories and naming of tropical cyclones.</li>
<li>IMD is one of the six RSMCs to provide tropical cyclone and storm surge advisories to 13 member countries under the WMO/Economic and Social Commission for Asia-Pacific (ESCAP) Panel including <strong>Bangladesh, India, Iran, Maldives, Myanmar, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, United Arab Emirates and Yemen.</strong></li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Palaeoanthropologists have uncovered <strong>evidence that suggests that Homo naledi,</strong> an extinct human species, may have <strong>buried their dead and carved meaningful symbols in a cave</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>These behaviours were thought to be <strong>unique to our own species – Homo sapiens – and the Neanderthals.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The debate around burying the dead is based on differences between what scientists called <strong>mortuary behaviour and funerary behaviour</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mortuary behaviour is <strong>evident among chimps and elephants</strong>, for example, when they keep watch <strong>over a dead body or physically interact with it, expecting it to come back to life</strong>.</li>
<li>Funerary behaviours, on the other hand, <strong>are social acts by creatures that are capable of complex thought and understand them to be separate from the rest of the natural world</strong>. They understand the significance of what death is.</li>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: European regulators have approved the <strong>region’s first vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV),</strong> which causes thousands of hospitalisations and deaths annually.</p>
<p>The shot, called <strong>Arexvy</strong>, is made <strong>by British drugmaker GSK</strong> and is designed to protect <strong>people aged 60 and over.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV</strong>, is a common respiratory virus that usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms. Most people recover in a week or two, but RSV can be serious, especially for infants and older adults. The virus was first discovered in 1956.</p>
<ul>
<li>RSV is the <strong>most common cause of bronchiolitis</strong> (inflammation of the small airways in the lung) and <strong>pneumonia</strong> (infection of the lungs) in children younger than 1 year of age</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>complex molecular structure of the virus and safety concerns</strong> with previous vaccine attempts was making difficult the vaccine.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> A study conducted by scientists from the <strong>CSIR-Centre for Cellular &amp; Molecular Biology (CCMB)</strong> has revealed that genetic diversity decreases in species with larger body sizes and is higher in species where the mother cares for the offspring.</p>
<ul>
<li>The study focused on <strong>centipedes</strong> and found that they have higher <strong>genetic diversity compared to other arthropods</strong> like spiders and insects</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other findings of the study:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Genetic diversity was found to be higher in the <strong>southern hemisphere</strong>: The findings suggest that <strong>historic climatic stability and low seasonality</strong> in southern latitudes may contribute to higher genetic diversity.</li>
<li>Genetic diversity increased with the geographical distance between individuals, indicating limited gene flow between distant sites.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is Genetic Diversity?</strong></p>
<p>Genetic diversity refers to the variation in genetic information within a population or species. It is a <strong>fundamental component of biodiversity</strong> and plays a critical role in the survival, adaptability, and sustainability of species and ecosystems.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation using an example:</strong></p>
<p>In a population of butterflies, <strong>genetic diversity refers to the presence of various genetic variations</strong> that determine traits like <strong>wing colour and patterns</strong>. This diversity allows butterflies to adapt to different environments. <strong>If a disease affects butterflies</strong> with a specific wing colour, low genetic diversity can lead to population decline. However, high genetic diversity enables some butterflies to be resistant to the disease, ensuring population survival and recovery.</p>
