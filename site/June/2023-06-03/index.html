<h4 id="gs-paper-2"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Functions and Responsibilities of the Union and the States</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/law-commission-recommends-retention-of-sedition-law-in-india-proposes-changes-101685681464225.html"><strong>HT</strong></a> </p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Law Commission of India has recommended the retention of the 153-year-old colonial law on sedition in India.</p>
<p><strong>The Sedition Law in India:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Section 124A of the IPC:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It deals with Sedition – a non-bailable offence and was drafted by TB Macaulay and included in the IPC in 1870.</li>
<li>Whoever (by words/signs/visible representation) brings or attempts to bring into hatred or contempt or excites or attempts to excite disaffection towards the Government established by law in India shall be punished.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Punishment under Section 124A:</strong> Punishment under the law varies from imprisonment up to three years to a life term and fine.</p>
<p><strong>Need of Section 124A:</strong>  <strong>To effectively combat</strong> anti-national, secessionist and terrorist elements.</p>
<p><strong>Criticism of Section 124A:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is designed to <strong>suppress the liberty</strong> of the citizens (Gandhiji).</li>
<li>It is highly objectionable and the <strong>sooner we get rid of it, the better it is</strong> (Jawaharlal Nehru).</li>
<li><strong>Not in tune with the current social milieu</strong>, and was intended for a colonial regime.</li>
<li>Often misused to muzzle dissent.</li>
<li><strong>Low conviction rate.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/disposal.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/disposal.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>In SC’s view:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In Kedar Nath Singh v State of Bihar (1962),</strong> the top court upheld the validity of Section 124A, but also attempted to restrict the colonial-era law’s scope for misuse.<ul>
<li>Invoking the sedition clause requires the <strong>existence of a harmful intent to promote violence</strong> and the penal provision <strong>cannot be utilised to restrict free speech.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The government <strong>could not put citizens behind bars simply because they chose to disagree</strong> with the state policies.</li>
<li>Views, which are <strong>dissent and different</strong> from the opinion of the government cannot be termed seditious.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steps taken:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In 2022, the SC effectively put on hold</strong> the colonial-era penal provision, and asked the Centre/states to desist from arresting/prosecuting people under the contentious provision.</li>
<li>The Union government recently informed the top court that the <strong>legislative process of reviewing/reforming the sedition law was in the “final stages”</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Law Commission of India on sedition law:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The sedition law is <strong>a reasonable restriction on the right to free speech.</strong></li>
<li><em>Repealing the legal provision</em> can have <strong>serious adverse ramifications for the security and integrity of the country</strong>.</li>
<li>Mere fact that a particular legal provision is colonial in its origin does not validate the case for its repeal.</li>
<li>Jurisdictions like the US, UK, etc., <strong>have actually merged their sedition law with counter-terror legislations.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations – Amend Section 124A of the IPC:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To bring about more clarity in the interpretation, understanding, and usage of the provision and to <strong>align it with the SC’s 1962 verdict.</strong></li>
<li>To replace mere inclination to incite violence or cause public disorder <strong>with proof of actual violence or imminent threat to violence.</strong></li>
<li>To enhance the alternative punishment to “7 years”, <strong>giving the courts greater room to award punishment</strong> in accordance with the gravity of the act.</li>
<li><strong>Procedural safeguards</strong> to minimise the abuse. <strong>For example,</strong> Section 154 of the CrPC could be amended to hold that a FIR under Section 124A would be registered only after a police officer conducts a <strong>preliminary inquiry.</strong></li>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>To make lateral entry successful, it is <strong>essential to strike a balance between the advantages it brings and the challenges it poses</strong>. The selection process <strong>should be transparent and credible</strong>, with <strong>specific criteria that attract domain experts and eminent individuals.</strong> Adequate training and support should be provided to lateral entrants to help them <strong>navigate the bureaucratic work culture and ensure effective collaboration with existing civil servants.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Unemployment and the jobs gap:</strong> Global unemployment is likely to return to the pre-pandemic level in 2023.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights of the ILO Monitor (11th edition):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In 2023,</strong> <strong>the global jobs gap</strong> (periods during one’s professional career when s/he did not have secure, formal employment) is projected to stand at 453 million people (11.7%), more than double the level of unemployment.<ul>
<li>Low-income countries in debt distress face a jobs gap of 25.7% in 2023.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some countries are facing complex and cascading crises, like natural disasters (e.g. the earthquakes in Türkiye and Syrian Arab Republic), <strong>which interact with broader global challenges and exacerbate labour market impacts.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Significant social protection policy gaps</strong> remain in developing countries, especially in low-income countries, including in regard to old-age pensions.<ul>
<li>Only 38.6% of older persons in lower middle-income countries receive an old-age pension.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Case of India: Unemployment rate</strong> declined sharply in 2021 and 2022, <strong>falling to 4.8%</strong>, which is almost 2 percentage points below its level of 2019 (6.5%).</p>
<p><strong>Some of the labour reforms in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Labour falls under the <strong>Concurrent List</strong> of the Constitution.</li>
<li>The central government replaced the 29 existing labour laws with <strong>four Codes. These Codes regulate</strong>: (i) Wages, (ii) Industrial Relations, (iii) Social Security, and (iv) Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions.</li>
<li><strong>eShram:</strong> This portal will help build a comprehensive National Database of Unorganised Workers (NDUW) in the country.</li>
<li><strong>PM Shram Yogi Maan-dhan (PM-SYM):</strong> Meant for old age protection and social security of Unorganised workers.</li>
<li><strong>Aam Admi Bima Yojana:</strong> Providing social security to unorganised sector workers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Building a national social protection floor:</strong> For example, by expanding basic old-age pensions in developing countries.<ul>
<li>This will act as a <strong>catalyst for inclusive sustainable development and decent jobs.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Policies and financial support:</strong> To build resilience and overcome the global employment divide.</li>
<li><strong>Build global financial resources:</strong> The UN Global Accelerator on Jobs and Social Protection, and the Global Coalition for Social Justice can play a positive role here.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="a-new-treaty-for-outer-space"><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/03/a-new-treaty-for-outer-space/">A new treaty for outer space</a></h3>
<h4 id="gs-paper-3_1"><strong>GS Paper 3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Developments in the field of Space</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/science-technology/un-recommends-new-treaty-to-ensure-peace-security-in-outer-space-89777"><strong>DTE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The United Nations (UN) has recommended a new treaty for ensuring peace and security as well as preventing an arms race in outer space.</p>
<p><strong>What is outer space?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Outer space is the region <strong>beyond a planet’s atmosphere</strong>. For Earth, <strong>it begins about 100 kms (62 miles) above sea level.</strong></li>
<li>The line separating the atmosphere and outer space is called the <strong>Karman line.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The recommendations, which are part of a <strong>UN policy brief</strong> (‘For All Humanity – The Future of Outer Space Governance’) come ahead of the <strong>UN Summit of the Future</strong>.</li>
<li>At the Summit of the Future, member states will agree on <strong>multilateral solutions for a better tomorrow and to strengthen global governance.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The new treaty for outer space:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Need:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Over the past decade, <strong>fundamental changes</strong> have been witnessed in outer space like weaponisation of space, exponential increase in satellite launches, etc.<ul>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> there were 210 new launches in 2013, which increased to 600 (2019), 1,200 (2020) and 2,470 (2022).</li>
<li>This increase is fuelled by the <strong>active participation of the private sector.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Outer space (like asteroids) contains <strong>abundant deposits of valuable metals</strong> (platinum, nickel, cobalt, etc) and governments are in favour of the exploitation of space resources.</li>
<li><strong>Space debris is another issue.</strong> More than 130 million smaller than one cm have been recorded.</li>
<li>Currently, <strong>there is no agreed international framework</strong> on space resource exploration, exploitation and utilisation.</li>
<li><strong>Conflict could arise</strong> if countries do not agree on international principles and could also lead to <strong>environmental degradation and cultural loss.</strong></li>
<li>Hence, the development of international norms, rules and principles will ensure <strong>effective governance, propel innovation and mitigate risks in outer space.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Existing treaties:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space:</strong> Established in 1959 by the UN to review and enable international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space.</li>
<li><strong>In 1963</strong>, countries agreed to prohibit testing nuclear weapons in outer space.</li>
<li><strong>In 1967, the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space</strong>, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, was agreed upon.<ul>
<li>It prohibits only weapons of mass destruction in outer space, not ordinary weapons.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>In 2022, the UN members agreed upon a series of guidelines, frameworks and recommendations</strong> on issues such as<ul>
<li>Mitigation of space debris,</li>
<li>Nuclear power source safety,</li>
<li>The long-term sustainability of outer space activities and</li>
<li>Transparency and confidence-building measures in outer space activities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key highlights of the recommended treaty:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A combination of binding and non-binding norms</strong> to address emerging risks to outer space security, safety and sustainability.</li>
<li><strong>It will consider important legal issues</strong>, including jurisdiction, control, liability and responsibility for environmental pollution in space for present and future generations.</li>
<li><strong>An additional framework to prevent an armed conflict</strong> in outer space and the weaponisation of outer space.</li>
<li><strong>An effective framework for coordinating space situational awareness</strong>, space object manoeuvres and events.</li>
<li><strong>An effective framework for sustainable exploration</strong>, exploitation and utilisation of the Moon and other celestial bodies for the benefit of all mankind.</li>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.livemint.com/news/india/aviation-ministry-proposes-draft-aircraft-bill-to-simplify-regulations-11685564833436.html"><strong>LM</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Civil Aviation Ministry has issued the <strong>Draft Aircraft Bill, 2023</strong> to replace the existing <strong>Aircraft Act, 1934</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Aim</strong>: The draft bill aims to provide a <strong>simplified approach to regulations (</strong>including design, manufacture, possession, use, operation, sale, import, and export<strong>)</strong> in order to meet the <strong>current needs of the civil aviation sector and</strong> remove redundancies <strong>present in the 1934 law.</strong> It also seeks to <strong>bring India in line with the Chicago Convention</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Major provisions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Creation of two statutory bodies, namely the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security and the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau. These bodies would be responsible for implementing <strong>the Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs)</strong> prescribed under <strong>the Chicago Convention</strong> and would discharge regulatory and oversight functions.</li>
<li><strong>Sufficient powers for the statutory regulatory bodies</strong>, such as the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Chicago Convention</strong></p>
<p>Also known as the Convention on International Civil Aviation, it is an international treaty established in 1944. It sets out the core principles for international air transport and created the <strong>International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)</strong> to oversee its implementation. The convention recognizes <strong>nine freedoms of air</strong>, with the <strong>first five being officially recognized by the ICAO</strong>. These freedoms <strong>grant countries the right to fly over</strong>, land in, and transport passengers and cargo between territories.</p>
<p><strong>India is its member</strong></p>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetailm.aspx?PRID=1929480"><strong>PIB</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) in India has transferred <strong>cost-effective lithium-ion battery recycling technology</strong> to nine recycling industries and start-ups as part of the <strong>Mission LiFE under the “Promote circularity campaign</strong>.”</p>
<p>This indigenous technology can process various types of <strong>discarded lithium-ion batteries</strong>, recovering over <strong>95% of lithium</strong>, <strong>cobalt, manganese, and nickel</strong> contents in the form of corresponding <strong>oxides/carbonates</strong> with a purity of about 98%.</p>
<p><strong>What is the recycling process?</strong></p>
<p>The recycling process of <strong>lithium-ion batteries involves several steps</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, the batteries are collected, sorted and disassembled</li>
<li>Next, the electrodes, which contain valuable metals like lithium, cobalt, manganese, and nickel, are extracted, through a process called <strong>leaching</strong>, where the electrodes are submerged in a <strong>liquid that dissolves these metals</strong>.</li>
<li>After that, the metals are <strong>purified to remove impurities</strong>, resulting in high-purity lithium, cobalt, manganese, and nickel compounds.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Aim of recycling</strong>: To recover valuable materials from lithium-ion batteries, reducing the need for mining and minimizing environmental impact. It helps conserve resources and promotes sustainable practices in battery manufacturing.</p>
<p><strong>Developed by</strong>: The technology was developed at the Centre of Excellence on E-waste Management, in collaboration with the Government of Telangana and industry partner.</p>
<p><strong>About</strong> </p>
<p>India generates more than <strong>50,000 tons of lithium-ion battery</strong> waste annually, growing in the range of 40-80%. India currently imports <strong>all of its Li from Australia and Argentina</strong> and <strong>70% of its Li-ion cell requirement</strong> from China and Hong Kong.</p>

<p><strong>Source: TH</strong></p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: A new ‘smart bandage’ helps in treating chronic wounds in a <strong>much more effective manner</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>What is a smart bandage?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>bandage works by using biosensors to track the chemical composition of the wound exudates,</strong> which changes as the wound heals.</li>
<li>It also monitors <strong>pH and temperature to provide real-time information about infection and inflammation</strong>. The bandage has a <strong>hydrogel layer with electrodes that control the release of drugs</strong>. It is <strong>wireless, eliminating the need for bulky equipment and wired connections.</strong></li>
<li>In tests, the bandage loaded with an <strong>antimicrobial substance proved effective against bacteria</strong> commonly associated with chronic wounds. It also <strong>enhanced tissue regeneration in skin cell</strong> <strong>investigations</strong>.</li>
<li>When applied to wounds in diabetic mice, the bandage accurately detected infection, inflammation, and metabolic statuses. Diabetic rats treated with the bandage and a combination of drugs and electrical stimulation showed faster wound healing and less scarring compared to those without this treatment.</li>
