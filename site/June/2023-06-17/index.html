<h4 id="gs-paper-1"><strong>GS Paper 1</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Role of Women</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://hdr.undp.org/system/files/documents/hdp-document/gsni202303pdf.pdf"><strong>UNDP</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The <strong>UNDP’s Gender Social Norms Index (GSNI) 2023</strong> has revealed no improvement in biases against women in a decade, with almost 9 out of 10 men and women worldwide still holding such biases.</p>
<p><strong>What is the GSNI?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>First introduced in the <strong>2019</strong> Human Development Report, GSNI provides an in-depth account of the <strong>root causes of gender inequality</strong> that hinder progress for women and girls.</li>
<li><strong>It covers 4 key dimensions</strong> – political, educational, economic and physical integrity – to highlight areas where women and girls face systematic disadvantages and discrimination.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/index.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/index.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Highlights of the GSNI 2023:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Half of people worldwide still believe <strong>men make better political leaders than women.</strong></li>
<li>Over 40% believe <strong>men make better business executives</strong> than women.</li>
<li>A staggering 25% of people believe it is justified for a man to beat his wife.</li>
<li>The share of women as heads of state or heads of government <strong>has remained around 10%</strong> since 1995.</li>
<li>In the labour market, <strong>women occupy less than a third of managerial positions</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>A broken link</strong> between women’s progress in education and economic empowerment.<ul>
<li><strong>For example</strong>, women are more skilled and educated than ever before, yet the average gender income gap remains a <strong>staggering 39% in favour of men</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact of these biases:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drive hurdles faced by women</strong> manifested in a dismantling of women’s rights, and a surge of human rights violations.</li>
<li>As a result, movements against gender equality are gaining traction in many parts of the world.</li>
<li><strong>Severe underrepresentation</strong> of women in leadership.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Governments have a crucial role in <strong>shifting gender social norms</strong>. <strong>For instance,</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Parental leave</strong> policies have changed perceptions around care work responsibilities, and</li>
<li><strong>Labour market reforms</strong> led to a change in beliefs around the employment of women.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Directly addressing social norms through <strong>education to change people’s views</strong> and more representation of women in decision-making and political processes.</li>
<li>An important place to start is <strong>recognising the economic value of unpaid care work</strong>, as women <strong>spend over six times</strong> as much time as men on unpaid care work.</li>
<li>The focus needs to be on expanding human development through –<ul>
<li><strong>Investment</strong> in laws and policy measures that promote women’s equality in political participation.</li>
<li><strong>Insurance</strong> such as strengthening social protection and care systems.</li>
<li><strong>Innovation,</strong> for example, combating online hate speech and gender disinformation can help to shift pervasive gender norms towards greater acceptance and equality.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Gender bias is a pervasive problem worldwide. Therefore, without tackling biased gender social norms, gender equality as reflected in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) can’t be achieved.</p>

<p><strong>Persisting issues:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>creation of buffer zones</strong> has raised <strong>concerns among Indian experts</strong>, who view them as a loss of territory for India.</li>
<li>These <strong>zones have allowed the Chinese to monitor Indian forces’ movements</strong> and establish infrastructure in the region. India has also been <strong>rapidly developing its infrastructure in response.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Despite ongoing engagement between the two sides, there is a fundamental difference in their perspectives on the border issue. India insists that the <strong>border situation must be resolved before normalization of bilateral relations can occur,</strong> while <strong>China believes that the issues have been resolved and suggests moving forward.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Context: Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC</strong>) released the National Time Release Study (NTRS) 2023 report.</p>
<p><strong>About National Time Release Study:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Time Release Study (TRS) is a <strong>performance measurement tool that quantifies the time taken for cargo release at customs stations</strong>. It measures the <strong>duration from cargo arrival to its out-of-charge for domestic clearance</strong> in imports and from cargo arrival to carrier departure in exports.</li>
<li>The study covers <strong>seaports, air cargo complexes (ACCs), inland container depots (ICDs), and integrated check posts (ICPs),</strong> which handle a significant proportion of entry and shipping bills in the country.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The findings highlight the <strong>importance of the “Path to Promptness” strategy</strong>, which <strong>includes advance filing of import documents, risk-based facilitation, and benefits for trusted clients</strong>. Cargoes that incorporate all three features achieve the <strong>National Trade Facilitation Action Plan release time target across all port categories.</strong></li>
<li>In line with the government’s focus on export promotion, <strong>NTRS 2023 places greater emphasis on measuring export release time</strong>.</li>
<li>The report differentiates between <strong>regulatory clearance (customs release) and physical clearance (completion of logistics processes).</strong> The study indicates that the National Trade Facilitation Action Plan release time target <strong>has been achieved for most port categories when considering regulatory clearance.</strong></li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Indian government and the <strong>Reserve Bank of India (RBI)</strong> are exploring the integration of the Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) with the Trade Receivables Discounting System (TReDS) platforms using an <strong>account aggregator</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>What is the Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN)?</strong></p>
<p>The Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) is a technology platform established by the Indian government to manage the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) system. It serves as a backbone for the GST regime, facilitating taxpayer registration, invoice filing, tax payment, and return filing processes.</p>
<p><strong>What are Trade Receivables Discounting System (TReDS) platforms?</strong></p>
<p>Trade Receivables Discounting System (TReDS) platforms are <strong>digital platforms that provide a mechanism for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)</strong> to raise funds by selling their trade receivables or invoices to financiers at a discounted rate. These platforms facilitate the early realization of funds, helping SMEs improve their cash flow and working capital.</p>
<p><strong>What is an account aggregator?</strong></p>
<p>An account aggregator is a financial intermediary that collects and consolidates a user’s financial data from various sources such as banks, mutual funds, insurance companies, and other financial institutions.</p>
<p><strong>Account Aggregator Network (AAN)</strong> is an RBI-regulated entity (with an NBFC-AA license) Currently, <strong>23 banks from both public and private</strong> are under the AAN. AA framework was created in <strong>2021 through an inter-regulatory decision</strong> by RBI and other regulators including <strong>SEBI, IRDA, and PFRDA</strong> through an initiative of the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC)</p>
<p><strong>How does the integration of GSTN with TReDS help?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It <strong>facilitates direct sanctions of invoices</strong> raised by Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) on the GSTN platform.</li>
<li>By integrating the two systems, <strong>e-invoices generated on the GSTN</strong> can be seamlessly transmitted to the TReDS portal, eliminating the need for additional activities or documentation.</li>
<li>This will lead to <strong>faster loan underwriting and sanctions</strong> as financiers will have greater confidence in the authenticity of the invoices sourced directly from the GST platform.</li>
<li>Development of an <strong>alternative credit database</strong>, particularly benefiting MSMEs with limited credit history.</li>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01992-0"><strong>Nature</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: Recently, scientists have <strong>successfully created advanced embryo-like structures</strong> using human stem cells. These synthetic embryos <strong>develop similarly to natural embryos at around 14 days after fertilization.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This breakthrough allows <strong>researchers unprecedented opportunities to study human embryonic development at later stages</strong>. However, it also raises ethical and legal questions regarding the regulation and status of these <strong>“embryo models.”</strong></li>
<li>The ability to study embryo models beyond 14 days is significant <strong>because it allows researchers to explore developmental defects and pregnancy loss</strong>, which are <strong>challenging to study using animal models.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Controversy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The scientific controversy surrounding this research arises from <strong>the highly competitive race to develop embryo models at later stages</strong>.</li>
<li>Ethical concerns have also emerged <strong>regarding the status and regulation of human embryo models.</strong> While these models are not subject to the 14-day rule applied to natural embryos<strong>, guidelines and regulations related to the use of human embryonic stem cells must be followed</strong>.</li>
