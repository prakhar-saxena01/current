<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) predicts a normal monsoon despite the possibility of an <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/15/el-nino-and-monsoon/">El Nino event.</a></p>
<p><strong>What is Monsoon and El Nino?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monsoon</strong>: A seasonal reversal of wind system that brings heavy rainfall, especially in the Indian subcontinent. The Indian summer monsoon <strong>affects a vast region spanning 25 countries and covering a distance of 18,000 kilometres</strong> from east to west and 6,000 kilometres from south to north.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/15/el-nino-and-monsoon/"><strong>El Nino</strong></a>: A climate pattern characterized by warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean, which can have widespread impacts on weather patterns around the world.</li>

<p><strong>What is the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)?</strong></p>
<p>IOD is a <strong>climate phenomenon in the Indian Ocean</strong> characterized by the fluctuation of sea surface temperatures and atmospheric pressure between its eastern and western parts. The IOD is similar in nature to the <strong>El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon</strong> in the Pacific Ocean but on a smaller scale.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IOD.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IOD.jpg" /></a></strong></p>

<p><strong>The Earth System Science Organisation (ESSO) and the IMD take into account five conditions while making forecasts about the monsoon in April every year.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1) The Sea Surface Temperature (SST) gradient</strong> between the North Atlantic and the North Pacific (conditions during December of the previous year and January of the present year)<br />
<strong>2) SST of the equatorial south Indian Ocean</strong> (conditions during February and March of the present year)<br />
<strong>3) Mean Sea Level pressure in East Asia</strong> (conditions during February and March of the present year)<br />
<strong>4) The surface air temperature over northwest Europe</strong> (conditions during January of the present year)<br />
<strong>5) The warm water volume of the equatorial Pacific Ocean</strong> (conditions during February and March of the present year)</p>
<p><strong>What are the limitations of forecasting El Nino and IOD?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>For the IOD and Atlantic Nino,</strong> forecasting models currently lack the reliability to accurately predict their occurrence and behaviour. As a result, their specific role in influencing monsoon patterns in a particular season remains uncertain.</li>
<li><strong>When it comes to forecasting El Nino events</strong>, models face challenges in precisely predicting the location and intensity of warming during the early stages.</li>

<h4 id="gs-paper-1_1"><strong>GS Paper 1</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Indian society</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/climate-change/domestic-violence-to-rise-as-subcontinent-heats-up-study-90313"><strong>DTE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> According to a study, <strong>domestic violence will rise as temperatures across the Indian subcontinent spike.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Findings of the study:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>These findings highlight the <strong>vulnerabilities and inequalities of women experiencing</strong> <strong>Intimate Partner Violence</strong> (IPV) in low- and middle-income countries in the context of <strong>global climate warming</strong>.</li>
<li>High ambient temperature may be associated with the <strong>risk of IPV against women</strong>. Each 1°C increase in the annual mean temperature is associated with a mean increase in IPV prevalence of 4.49%.</li>
<li><strong>The prevalence of physical violence was highest</strong> (23.0%), followed by emotional and sexual violence.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How does global warming increase IPV prevalence?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Increasing temperature is<ul>
<li><strong>Squeezing working hours</strong> → impacting the income of <strong>daily wage</strong> earners → Family members <strong>spend maximum time within the house</strong> → <em>increasing the workload for women</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Generating requirements for comfort</strong> which low-income groups and economically weaker sections cannot afford.</li>
<li>Directly impacting mental health.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All of this is contributing to domestic violence.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges ahead: The IPV prevalence would increase by 21% by the end of the 21st century</strong> under unlimited emissions scenarios.</p>
<p><strong>Case of India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This comes as India witnessed several <strong>heat-related deaths</strong> with temperatures up to 45 degrees Celsius in certain parts of the country.</li>
<li>India is likely to experience the <strong>highest</strong> IPV prevalence increase (23.5%) in the 2090s, followed by Nepal and Pakistan.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Climate action</strong> is an essential component in the ongoing fight to eliminate violence against women and girls.<ul>
<li><strong>For example, under stricter emissions-cut scenarios</strong>, the IPV prevalence would only moderately increase.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The world also needs greater involvement of women in climate action</strong> → gender mainstreaming in the policymaking process.<ul>
<li>UNICEF’s <strong>Gender Action Plan (GAP)</strong> and the <strong>Lima work programme on Gender</strong> (LWGP adopted at UNFCCC’s COP 20) are efforts in this direction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Tackling the issue of violence against women and girls is an important step towards achieving the core objective of the <strong>Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</strong>, which is to leave no one behind.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> India’s bioeconomy growth is not in sync with desired funding and policy support.</p>
<p><strong>Bioeconomy:</strong> It is the economic activity involving the use of biotechnology and biomass in the production of goods, services, or energy.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chain.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chain.png" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>India’s bioeconomy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>According to the DBT’s ‘Bioeconomy Report 2022’ report, <strong>India’s bioeconomy contributes 2.6% to the GDP</strong> and by 2030 it will be ~5% of the GDP.</li>
<li><strong>This ambitious leap</strong> of $220 billion in eight years <strong>will require aggressive investment and policy support.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Concerns:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Neither funding for the DBT nor its recent policies</strong> reflect any serious intention to uplift this sector.</li>
<li><strong>For example,</strong><ul>
<li>The current Budgetary allocation to the DBT is <strong>only 0.0001% of India’s GDP.</strong></li>
<li>Also, <strong>policies</strong> that enable risk-taking appetite within Indian scientists to create an ecosystem of innovation and industrial action, <strong>are missing</strong>.</li>
<li>Also, the <strong>alignment between biotechnology policies and economic goals</strong> is missing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Case study – Problems in the Guidelines for Genetically Engineered (GE) Insects:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Uncertainty of purpose</strong><ul>
<li>The guidelines emphasise that GE insects <strong>offer applications in various fields</strong> (such as human and livestock health; crop management; etc) <strong>uplifting the standard of living</strong> by<ul>
<li>Reducing disease burden,</li>
<li>Enabling food security and</li>
<li>Conserving the environment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>However, the guidelines <strong>don’t specify the purposes for which GE insects may be approved in India</strong>.</li>
<li>The guidelines <strong>only provide regulatory procedures for R&amp;D on insects</strong> with some beneficial applications.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Uncertainty for researchers:</strong><ul>
<li>The guidelines are <strong>applicable only to research and not to confined trials or deployment.</strong></li>
<li>Once the insects are ‘made’ and tested in the laboratory, researchers can conduct trials with them on the approval of the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) of the MoEFCC.</li>
<li>Once deployed, <strong>GE insects can’t be recalled and unlike GM foods they are not amenable to individual consumer choice</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Uncertainty of ambit:</strong><ul>
<li>The guidelines offer standard operating procedures for GE mosquitoes, crop pests, and beneficial insects – <strong>but what ‘beneficial’ means, in the context of GE insects, is not clear</strong>.</li>
<li>The lack of clarity will impede funders and scientists from investing in this research.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Further efforts are needed to attract private funding</strong> for biotechnology R&amp;D.</li>
<li><strong>Policies need to be significantly revised</strong> if biotechnology is to be of any serious consequence to the economy.</li>
<li>Both of the above are essential considering the <strong>importance of biotechnology to any pandemic preparedness efforts.</strong></li>

<p>Context: The government of India recently passed <strong>an amendment to the New Drugs and Clinical Trial Rules (2023)</strong> that permits researchers to utilize <strong>non-animal and human-relevant methods</strong> for testing the safety and effectiveness of new drugs.</p>
<ul>
<li>It will amend the <strong>Drugs and Clinical Trials Rules, 2019</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Alternative methods proposed are</strong> 3D organoids, 3D bioprinter, organs-on-chip, and advanced computational methods.</p>

<tr>
<td><strong>Limitations</strong></td>
<td><strong>Description</strong></td>
<td><strong>Example</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Limited predictability for human response</strong></td>
<td>Animals may respond differently to drugs compared to humans due to <strong>differences in biological processes, genetics, and other factors</strong>.</td>
<td>The <strong>drug Thalidomide</strong> caused severe birth defects in humans but <strong>did not produce the same effects in animal tests</strong>, leading to tragic consequences.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Ethical Concerns and animal welfare</strong></td>
<td>Animal testing involves the <strong>use of sentient beings and raises ethical concerns regarding the suffering and harm caused to animals</strong>. This includes procedures such as <strong>force-feeding, injections, and euthanasia.</strong></td>
<td>The <strong>Draize test</strong>, which involves applying substances to animals’ eyes, has been criticized for causing severe pain and distress.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>The high failure rate in translating to human efficacy</strong></td>
<td>Despite passing animal testing, many drugs fail during human clinical trials, leading to wasted resources and potential harm to human participants.</td>
<td>For instance, a study published in the British Medical Journal found that <strong>over 90% of drugs tested on animals fail</strong> to translate into safe and effective treatments for humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Inadequate representation of human diversity</strong></td>
<td>Animals used in testing may not accurately represent the diversity of human populations in terms of age, sex, genetic variations, and underlying health conditions.</td>
<td>For example, the drug <strong>Ximelagatran</strong> showed promise in animal studies but caused <strong>liver damage in humans</strong>, highlighting the need for more accurate models.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Regulatory and legal considerations</strong></td>
<td>The use of animals in testing is subject to regulatory requirements and ethical considerations, which can lead to delays, increased costs, and challenges in obtaining approvals.</td>
<td>The <strong>European Union has implemented a ban on animal testing for cosmetics.</strong></td>

<td><strong>Ethical Dilemma</strong></td>
<td><strong>Description</strong></td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Animal Suffering</strong></td>
<td>Animal experimentation often involves causing pain, distress, or harm to the animals, raising concerns about their welfare and the ethics of inflicting suffering on them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Moral Status of Animals</strong></td>
<td>The debate centres around the <strong>moral consideration and rights of animals</strong>. Some argue that <strong>animals have inherent value and should not be subjected to experimentation</strong>, while others believe that human benefits justify their use.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Balancing Human Benefits</strong></td>
<td>The dilemma arises when weighing the potential benefits to human health and well-being against the harm caused to animals. Ethical considerations involve determining <strong>if the benefits are significant enough to justify the use of animals in experiments.</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Informed Consent and Voluntary Participation</strong></td>
<td>Unlike human clinical trials where participants can provide informed consent, <strong>animals have no agency or ability to voluntarily participate</strong> in experiments, raising questions about the ethics of subjecting them to testing without their consent.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Steps by Other Countries:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In 2021, the European Union</strong>passed a resolution on an action plan to facilitate the transition towards technologies that don’t use animals in research, regulatory testing, and education. <strong>The U.S. passed the FDA Modernization Act 2.0</strong> in December 2022, allowing researchers to use these systems to <strong>test the safety and efficacy of new drugs.</strong></li>
<li>Also, in 2022, South Korea introduced a Bill called ‘<strong>Vitalization of Development, Dissemination, and Use of Alternatives to Animal Testing Methods’</strong>.</li>
<li>In June 2023, <strong>Canada amended its Environmental Protection Act</strong> to replace, reduce or refine the use of vertebrate animals in toxicity testing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Thus the use of non-animal methods is significant for avoiding these ethical dilemmas. However, India faces challenges in terms of <strong>interdisciplinary expertise and the availability of resources for research</strong> in this area. Efforts are being made to establish <strong>centres of excellence and develop an end-to-end ecosystem</strong> in India to support the implementation of these new technologies.</p>

<p><strong>Case Study: One of the scientists working in the R&amp;D laboratory of a major pharmaceutical company discovers that one of the company’s bestselling veterinary drugs has the potential to cure a currently incurable liver disease which is prevalent in tribal areas. However, developing a variant of the drug suitable for human beings entailed a lot of research and development having a huge expenditure to the extent of Rs. 50 crores. It was unlikely that the company would recover the cost as the disease was rampant only in poverty-stricken areas having very little market otherwise. (250 Words)</strong></p>

<p>The U.S. Supreme Court recently ruled to <strong>strike down race-conscious policies</strong> in college admissions, bringing an end to affirmative action in higher education. Affirmative action refers to admissions policies that <strong>aim to increase the representation of minority students, such as Black and Hispanic students, on college campuses</strong>.</p>
<p>Many colleges and universities consider <strong>race as part of a holistic approach to admissions</strong>, along with other factors like grades and extracurricular activities, to promote <strong>diversity and enhance the educational experience</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for such a decision</strong>: US Supreme Court has <strong>narrowly emphasized individual rights</strong> and <strong>equal treatment</strong> over considerations of <strong>historical disadvantage or societal diversity</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Impact</strong>: The impact of this ruling will lead colleges to explore new strategies to ensure diversity in their student populations. Also, Indian Students will be affected as well.</p>
<p>Usage: The example can be used as a counterargument to affirmative policies in India.</p>

<p><strong>Extreme heat in Indian slums</strong> is negatively affecting <strong>women’s health and productivity</strong>. To address this issue, the <strong>Mahila Housing Trust (MHT),</strong> a non-profit organization, has introduced a simple solution: <strong>painting roofs with white solar-reflective paint</strong>. The reflective paint helps <strong>limit the heat from infiltrating the homes</strong>, providing relief to women, children, and the elderly. It lowers indoor temperatures, allowing for improved health, increased work hours, and better studying conditions.</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: A new certification scheme has been <strong>launched in India</strong> to promote responsible antibiotic manufacturing (first of its kind)</p>
<p><strong>About the Scheme:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Developed by</strong>: the <strong>British Standards Institute</strong> (BSI) (a business improvement and standards company) and the <strong>AMR Industry Alliance</strong> (one of the largest private sector coalitions that provide long-term solutions to antimicrobial resistance)</li>
<li><strong>Aim</strong>: To address <strong>environmental concerns</strong> related to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) by limiting the release of antibiotic residues into <strong>waterways through industrial waste</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Process</strong>:<ul>
<li>The certification process involves <strong>third-party validation to</strong> monitor environmental practices throughout the manufacturing process.</li>
<li><strong>Manufacturers must demonstrate effective</strong> environmental management and <strong>wastewater treatment systems</strong> to obtain certification.</li>
<li><strong>The concentration of antibiotics</strong> in waste streams must be below a specified threshold to prevent the emergence of AMR in the environment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Time</strong>: The certification is valid for three years, with annual surveillance to ensure ongoing compliance.</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2022, The AMR Industry Alliance and BSI came up with a set of <a href="https://www.amrindustryalliance.org/antibiotic-manufacturing-standard/"><strong>Antibiotic Manufacturing Standards</strong></a> and launched the certification to ensure their implementation. The initiative is part of efforts to promote sustainable and responsible drug production while mitigating the environmental impact of antibiotic manufacturing.</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: The <strong>American bald eagle</strong> was removed from the <strong>endangered species list in 2007</strong>, marking <strong>a significant milestone in its conservation</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The bird’s <strong>population has steadily increased since then</strong>, with a <strong>2021 report</strong> stating that the <strong>number of bald eagles in the wild has quadrupled since 2009.</strong></li>
<li>The bald eagle, once abundant across the United States with an estimated 100,000 nesting birds in the country, <strong>faced a severe decline in population due to hunting, habitat destruction, and the pesticide</strong> However, measures such as the ban on DDT and the implementation of the Endangered Species Act helped protect the species and prevent it from going extinct.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> A recent outbreak of algae bloom – commonly known as red tide – has sickened and killed an unknown number of sea lions and dolphins off the coast of California, US.</p>
<p><strong>Sea lions (IUCN Status – Endangered):</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/sea_lion.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/sea_lion.png" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>They are pinnipeds characterised by</strong> external ear flaps, long fore flippers, the ability to walk on all fours, short and thick hair and a big chest and belly.</li>
<li><strong>Their range extends from the subarctic to tropical waters</strong> of the global ocean in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, except the northern Atlantic Ocean.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Algal bloom/red tides:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An algal bloom is a term used for the <strong>excessive growth of algae</strong> over a water body causing <strong>discolouration</strong> of the water body.<ul>
<li>Blooms can proliferate because of human causes such as <strong>climate change and an excess of nitrates</strong> washed out to sea.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Red tide</strong> is the red colouration of seawater due to the presence of <strong>dinoflagellate Gonyaulax.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Algal blooms cause the production of a <strong>neurotoxin called domoic acid</strong> and result in the <strong>death of fish and other aquatic organisms.</strong></li>
<li>Small fish consume the toxin and pass it up the <strong>food chain</strong>. Humans are unaffected unless they eat infected shellfish.</li>

<p>The UK Court of Appeal has <strong>ruled against the government’s plan to send asylum seekers</strong> to Rwanda, dealing a blow to <strong>Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s administration</strong>. The policy, known as the <strong>“Rwanda policy</strong>,” is part of the government’s strategy to <strong>deter migrants</strong> from crossing the English Channel to seek asylum in the UK. It involves relocating potential <strong>asylum seekers to Rwanda</strong> while their applications are processed.</p>
<p><strong>Rwanda is a landlocked country</strong> in the <strong>Great Rift Valley of Central Africa</strong>, where the African Great Lakes region and Southeast Africa converge. Located a few degrees south of the Equator, Rwanda is bordered by <strong>Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</strong> </p>
