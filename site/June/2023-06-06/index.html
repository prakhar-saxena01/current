<h4 id="gs-paper-3"><strong>GS Paper 3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Conservation, environmental pollution and degradation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/increased-rainfall-alone-will-not-help-groundwater-recovery/article66925433.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Since <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/04/06/insights-into-editorial-making-groundwater-visible/">groundwater</a> consumption and the variability of monsoon rainfall are the two main factors influencing groundwater storage, climate change might pose <strong>new challenges for groundwater sustainability in India.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Groundwater:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Groundwater is the water that seeps through rocks and soil and is stored <strong>beneath the ground.</strong> <strong>Aquifers</strong> are the rocks in which groundwater is stored.</li>
<li><strong>The role of groundwater in human development</strong> becomes bigger in the face of water scarcity affecting about 2.7 billion people around the world.</li>
<li><strong>Groundwater management</strong> is imperative to meet the UN-mandated <strong>SDG 6</strong> of providing clean water and sanitation for all.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Groundwater situation in India:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/water_fact.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/water_fact.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Groundwater is India’s <strong>most used</strong> water resource, accounting for a quarter of total global groundwater extraction.</li>
<li>According to the 2021 CAG report, <strong>groundwater extraction in India has exceeded the recharge rate</strong>, threatening 80% of potable water over the next two decades.</li>
<li><strong>About 95% of India’s</strong> <strong>groundwater was depleted</strong> between 2002 and 2022, mostly in north India due to increased groundwater pumping <strong>to meet crop irrigation needs.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Legal/constitutional/policy framework in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Indian Easement Act, 1882:</strong> Does not establish groundwater ownership and rights clearly.</li>
<li><strong>Article 21:</strong> The fundamental right to clean water is recognised under the right to life.</li>
<li><strong>Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA):</strong> It is established by the <strong>Environment (Protection) Act, 1986</strong>, to frame groundwater policies and programs.</li>
<li><strong>Supreme Court:</strong> ‘<strong>Public trust doctrine</strong>’ – Making groundwater a matter of private ownership would be unfair.</li>
<li><strong>Govt schemes:</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/29/atal-bhujal-yojana-aby/">Atal Bhujal Yojana</a>, Jal Shakti Abhiyan, Aquifer Mapping and Management Programme, etc., are some of the initiatives for groundwater management.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/climate-change-and-associated-issues/"><strong>Climate change</strong></a> (global warming will increase the frequency of hydroclimate extremes – floods and droughts) and <strong>unsustainable groundwater extraction.</strong><ul>
<li><strong>The amount of rain (during the summer monsoon) will rise</strong> as the climate warms.</li>
<li>However, groundwater recovery may not be possible due to the expected rise in groundwater extraction for irrigation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>A warming climate will increase evapotranspiration –</strong> the process by which water moves from the land surface to the atmosphere via evaporation and transpiration.</li>
<li>The above factors will <strong>limit water availability for groundwater recovery.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Restrict unsustainable groundwater use for irrigation, <strong>cracking down on illegal borewells.</strong></li>
<li>Make irrigation more efficient to promote groundwater conservation.</li>
<li>Groundwater storage variations can be understood by satellite data [say, from NASA’s GRACE satellites] that help conservation efforts be planned appropriately.</li>

<h4 id="gs-paper-3_1"><strong>GS Paper 3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus</strong><strong>: Science and Technology</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/higgs-boson-z-boson-photon-lhc-standard-model-test/article66933432.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Physicists working with the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/13/large-hadron-collider-lhc/"><strong>Large Hadron Collider (LHC)</strong></a> <strong>particle-smasher</strong> at CERN, reported that they had <strong>detected a Higgs boson decaying into a Z boson particle and a photon</strong> which is a very rare decay process.</p>
<p><strong>About Higgs Boson:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Higgs boson is a <strong>subatomic particle that gives other particles mass</strong>. The strength of a particle’s interaction with the Higgs boson determines its mass.</li>
<li><strong>For Example</strong>, Electrons have a certain mass, protons have more, and neutrons have slightly more than protons because of their interactions with the Higgs boson. The <strong>Higgs boson can also interact with other Higgs bosons, indicating its greater mass.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Need for understanding Higgs Boson:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The properties of the Higgs boson and how particles <strong>interact with it can provide insights into the universe</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Z boson and a photon:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Virtual particles are particles that <strong>briefly exist and cannot be directly detected but have lingering effects according to quantum field theory</strong>.</li>
<li>The creation of a Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) involves interactions with virtual particles, resulting in the <strong>production of a Z boson and a photon.</strong> Photons, which are particles of light, <strong>have no mass because they do not interact with the Higgs boson.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About the Standard Model of Particle Physics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Standard Model is a theory in physics that <strong>describes how the smallest particles in the universe behave and interact with each other</strong>.</li>
<li>According to the Standard Model, there are several types of particles. <strong>There are particles called quarks, which are the building blocks of protons and neutrons, and there are particles called leptons, which include electrons.</strong> These particles have different properties like mass and electric charge.</li>
<li>The theory explains how these particles <strong>interact with each other through different forces</strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong>Standard Model predicts the probabilities of different decay paths.</strong> The recent measurement confirms the decay of a Higgs boson into a Z boson and a photon, which was previously observed but now with increased statistical precision.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The IRENA released the ‘<strong>Low-cost finance for the energy transition’</strong> report.</p>
<p><strong>The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is an <strong>intergovernmental</strong> organization (an official UN observer, founded in 2009, HQ – Masdar City, Abu Dhabi) mandated to facilitate cooperation, advance knowledge, and promote the adoption and sustainable use of renewable energy.</li>
<li>It is the <strong>first international organization</strong> to focus exclusively on renewable energy, addressing needs in both industrialized and developing countries.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Need for low-cost finance for the energy transition:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The energy transition</strong> is essential to achieve the <strong>5°C climate target</strong> under the Paris Agreement.</li>
<li>Hence, for a <strong>sustained energy transition</strong>, it is essential to ensure that low-cost finance is available to both emerging markets and advanced economies.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CO2.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CO2.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Highlights of the report:</strong></p>

<li><strong>Success story:</strong> Renewable power generation technologies, notably <strong>solar photovoltaic and onshore wind power</strong>, have become mature and competitive.</li>
<li><strong>Other technologies:</strong> Such as offshore wind, hydrogen electrolysers, energy storage and heat pumps, <strong>need to be deployed at faster speeds, and greater scales</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>policies to support industry innovation:</strong> Particularly during the early R&amp;D (in enabling technologies, business models, market design and system operation) to foster commercially mature solutions with reduced costs.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/05/centre-clears-%E2%82%B919744-crore-green-hydrogen-mission/"><strong>Green hydrogen</strong></a><strong>:</strong> To enable end-use technologies utilising hydrogen, as well as the expansion of infrastructure to harness this potential.</li>
<li><strong>Investment in energy transition technologies:</strong> With a focus on renewable energy, energy efficiency, electrification and enabling infrastructure – <strong>end-use electrification –</strong> to fully capture the benefit of renewable power.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Case of India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/03/10/sansad-tv-future-of-green-energy-in-india/"><strong>renewable energy</strong></a> <strong>sector:</strong><ul>
<li>It has seen unprecedented growth driven by <strong>national targets of 175 GW</strong> of renewable energy capacity by <strong>2022</strong> and <strong>500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030</strong>.</li>
<li>India ranked third on the Renewable Energy Attractive Index in 2021, and its solar and wind power base is the fourth largest in the world.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>IREDA’s role in India’s Energy Transition:</strong> The Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Limited (IREDA) was established by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy as <strong>a renewable-energy-focussed non-bank finance corporation in 1987.</strong></li>
<li><strong>India Sovereign Green Bond Issuance:</strong> To mobilize private sector capital for sustainable development and lower the cost of capital for green projects by tapping into new investors.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead to ensure low-cost finance for the energy transition:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/finance.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/finance.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blended capital needs to be urgently mobilised:</strong> From the domestic and international capital resources of the private and public sectors.</li>
<li><strong>Domestic financial markets are critical:</strong> Since they provide diversified funding sources (corporate bond markets) to avoid currency risk and help mitigate macroeconomic shocks.</li>
<li><strong>G20 members have a wealth of experience:</strong> In facilitating access to low-cost finance and can share valuable knowledge on innovative financing solutions to reduce the cost of capital.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Low-cost capital for financing energy transition projects could be possible through a deeper public-private collaboration on the journey to a net-zero future.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The DSCI released a study called ‘<strong>Bridging the Gap: Identifying Challenges in Cybersecurity Skilling and Bridging the Divide.’</strong></p>
<p><strong>Data Security Council of India (DSCI):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is a <strong>not-for-profit</strong>, industry body on data protection setup by NASSCOM in <strong>2008</strong>.</li>
<li>It is <strong>committed to making cyberspace safe, secure and trusted</strong> by establishing best practices, standards and initiatives in cyber security and privacy.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/04/05/cybersecurity-in-india/"><strong>The cybersecurity landscape in India</strong></a><strong>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cybersecurity refers</strong> to every aspect of protecting an organisation and its employees and assets against cyber threats.</li>
<li>India, as a nation undergoing <strong>rapid digitisation</strong> across various sectors, is <strong>not immune to the increasing number and severity of cyber threats</strong>.</li>
<li>To address these challenges, <strong>stakeholders in the ecosystem have implemented several initiatives</strong> to promote Cybersecurity in the country.</li>
<li><strong>These include –</strong><ul>
<li><strong>The</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/01/cert-in-may-be-exempted-from-rti/"><strong>Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In)</strong></a>, set up by the Government of India, to provide guidance and support in the event of cyber incidents;</li>
<li><strong>Programs like Cyber Shikshaa,</strong> implemented by <strong>Microsoft and DSCI</strong>, to skilled professionals in the Cybersecurity domain and to generate awareness among people.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Though the cybersecurity industry has gained significant importance and is expected to grow rapidly in India, there is <strong>still a deficit of skilled workforce</strong> to cater to the demands of the sector.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/imp.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/imp.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>About the study:</strong> It aims to</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Analyse</strong> the demand and supply of skilled cybersecurity professionals in India,</li>
<li><strong>Identify</strong> technical and social factors contributing to the shortage of skilled professionals, and</li>
<li><strong>Explore</strong> solutions to address these gaps through CSR and a multi-stakeholder approach.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Findings of the study:</strong></p>
<p><strong>The top three</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/security-issues/cyber-security/various-cyber-threats/"><strong>attacks</strong>:</a></p>
<ul>
<li>That are expected to see substantial rise in the near future are <strong>phishing, smishing, and vishing attacks</strong>, followed by ransomware attacks and zero-day exploits.</li>
<li><strong>Phishing scams</strong> trick users into divulging sensitive data, downloading malware, and exposing themselves or their organisations to cybercrime.</li>
<li><strong>Smishing</strong> often involves sending bogus text messages – have a sense of urgency and request the recipient click on a link or reply with personal information.</li>
<li><strong>Vishing</strong> (voice or VoIP phishing) uses voice and telephony technologies to trick targeted individuals into revealing sensitive data to unauthorised entities.</li>
<li><strong>Zero-day attacks</strong> take place when hackers exploit the flaw before developers have a chance to address it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Three major trends</strong>: <strong>That will catalyse the demand for Cybersecurity are –</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use of <strong>AI, ML and IoT</strong> by hackers resulting in increasing Cybersecurity attacks,</li>
<li>Growing regulatory liabilities and</li>
<li>Excessive usage of digital platforms resulting in exchange of large amounts of data.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cybersecurity professionals:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cybersecurity Risk Analyst, Cybersecurity Analyst, and Penetration Tester are the most prevalent job roles at present.</li>
<li>They constitute <strong>less than 5% of their company’s overall workforce.</strong></li>
<li>43% of corporations have <strong>women participation</strong> between 21%-40% of the overall Cybersecurity workforce.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Need for organisations to perform risk assessments</strong> at regular intervals and have robust security measures.</li>
<li><strong>There is a need for –</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Multi-stakeholder collaboration</strong> to map industry-relevant skills, and design and deliver skilling programs as per industry standards.</li>
<li><strong>Training providers/NGOs</strong> to promote <strong>the inclusion of diverse groups</strong> and formulate strong inclusive programs that can specifically cater for the needs of PwDs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Corporates can play a pivotal role</strong> [through their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)] by incorporating and sponsoring Cybersecurity certification (addressing the certification gaps) as a part of their skilling initiatives.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong>  The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) is facing a <strong>severe financial crisis and is on the verge of collapse</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for underfunding:</strong></p>
<p>Chronic underfunding over the past decade has left UNRWA with a <strong>$75 million shortfall</strong>, jeopardizing its essential programs in the Middle East. It has faced chronic underfunding due to a <strong>lack of sustained financial support from the international community.</strong></p>
<p><strong>About  UNRWA</strong> </p>
<p>Established in 1949 (HQ:  Amman, Jordan and Gaza, Palestinian Authority), UNRWA provides <strong>aid and services</strong> to nearly <strong>six million Palestinians</strong> in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan. The agency relies heavily on <strong>voluntary contributions.</strong> The agency plays a vital role in providing education and hopes for the future to hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugee children.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The government has banned 14 <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2018/12/11/fixed-dose-combinations-fdcs/">fixed-dose combination drugs</a> <strong>citing there is “no therapeutic justification”</strong> for these medicines and that they <strong>may involve “risk” to people</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The decision was taken on the basis of the <strong>recommendations of an expert committee and the Drugs Technical Advisory Board.</strong></li>
<li>Prohibit the manufacture, sale or distribution of this FDC was done under <strong>section 26 A of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, of 1940.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Fixed Dose Combination drugs:</strong></p>
<p>Fixed-Dose Combination (FDC) drugs are medications that contain two or more active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in a single formulation, to enhance therapeutic outcomes or simplify treatment regimens.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: Augmentin: contains amoxicillin (anti-bacterial drug) and clavulanic acid (enhances absorption of amoxicillin)</p>
<p>In 2016, the <strong>government announced the ban on the manufacture, sale and distribution of 344 drug combinations after an expert panel</strong>, set up at the behest of the Supreme Court had stated they were being sold to patients without scientific data and <strong>the order was challenged by the manufacturers in court.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>currently banned 14 FDCs are part of those 344 drug combinations</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The government permitted the <strong>import of Needle pet coke for making graphite anode material for</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/03/li-ion-battery-recycling-technology/"><strong>lithium-ion batteries</strong></a> as a feedstock and <strong>not for any other purposes</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Import of pet coke for fuel purposes is completely banned.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, <strong>the sulphur content in the NPC should be less than 0.8 per cent,</strong> which would be <strong>monitored by state pollution control boards.</strong></p>
<p><strong>About Pet Coke:</strong></p>
<p>Petroleum coke (pet coke) is a <strong>carbon-rich solid material derived from the final cracking process</strong>, a thermo-based chemical engineering process that <strong>splits long-chain hydrocarbons of petroleum into shorter chains.</strong> As the world’s largest consumer of pet coke, <strong>India imports over half its annual petcoke consumption, mainly from the USA.</strong></p>
<p><strong>About Needle Pet Coke:</strong></p>
<p>Needle pet Coke differs from <strong>regular petroleum Coke in its unique physical and chemical properties.</strong> It is called “needle” coke because of its <strong>needle-like structure, which is formed during the refining process.</strong> This structure gives it certain advantageous properties that make it suitable for specific applications.</p>
<ul>
<li>One of the primary uses of needle pet coke is in the <strong>production of graphite electrodes used in electric arc furnaces for steelmaking</strong>. The needle-like structure <strong>of NPC provides excellent electrical conductivity and high strength</strong>, making it ideal for manufacturing high-quality electrodes. These electrodes are crucial for the efficient melting and refining of steel.</li>
<li>Needle pet coke is also used in other applications that require <strong>high-performance carbon materials, such as in the production of lithium-ion batteries, aerospace components, and certain carbon products used in the chemical industry.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The harmful effect of Pet Coke:</strong></p>
<p>Pet coke combustion emits significant amounts of <strong>greenhouse gases and air pollutants</strong>, including sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter. Pet Coke has a high carbon content and a low energy value compared to other fossil fuels.</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: A recent study by researchers from the <strong>National Institute of Technology Srinagar</strong> has revealed an alarming level of <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/04/27/sansad-tv-nature-and-you-plastic-in-blood/">microplastics</a> in the Jhelum River in Kashmir, mainly attributed to unscientific municipal solid waste disposal sites.</p>
<p>Microplastics, <strong>measuring less than 5 millimetres</strong>, are particularly problematic as they can be ingested by riverine fauna and marine species, causing <strong>bioaccumulation</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>About Jhelum River:</strong></p>
<p>The river originates from <strong>a spring at Verinag.</strong> It initially flows northwards into Wular Lake, and then changes its course southwards. At <strong>Muzaffarabad</strong>, the river takes a sharp hairpin bend, turning southward. It serves as the boundary between India and Pakistan for a distance of 170 km and emerges at the <strong>Potwar Plateau near Mirpur</strong>. Finally, the river joins the Chenab River at <strong>Trimmu</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> A study conducted by the <strong>Central Institute of Fisheries Education</strong> highlighted the detrimental <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/world-geography/physical-geography-of-the-world/oceanography/marine-resources/impact-of-anthropogenic-activities-on-marine-resources/">impact of pollution on native fish species</a> and breeding grounds in Dal Lake since 2007-08.</p>
<p>The study attributes the pollution to factors such as increased alkalinity, elevated pH levels, rising chloride content, reduced inflow of water and human activities such as sewage discharge and organic runoff.</p>
<p><strong>About</strong></p>
<p>Dal Lake is an urban lake located in Srinagar. Spanning 18 square km, it is part of a <strong>natural wetland that includes floating</strong> gardens known as <strong>“Raad” in</strong> Kashmiri. These gardens bloom with lotus flowers in July and August.</p>
