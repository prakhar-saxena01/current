<h4 id="gs-paper-3"><strong>GS Paper 3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Infrastructure (Energy)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> [<strong>PIB</strong>](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1928750#:~:text=Funds%20to%20the%20tune%20of,capacity%20addition%20from%202022%2D2032&amp;text=The%20Central%20Electricity%20Authority%20(CEA,the%20period%20of%202022%2D32.)</p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Central Electricity Authority (CEA) has notified the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/03/national-electricity-plan-for-2022-27/">National Electricity Plan (NEP)</a> for the period of 2022-32.</p>
<p><strong>The NEP:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>CEA</strong> (Ministry of Power, GoI) must create a NEP in line with the National Electricity Policy, according to the <strong>Electricity Act 2003,</strong> to –<ul>
<li><strong>Create</strong> short-term (every 5-year) and perspective plans (15-year)</li>
<li><strong>Assesses</strong> India’s current electricity needs, projected growth, power sources, and challenges</li>
<li><strong>Coordinate</strong> the efforts of different planning agencies to ensure that resources are used optimally</li>
<li><strong>Support</strong> the needs of the country’s economy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The 1st National Electricity Plan was published in 2007, the 2nd in 2013, and <strong>the third (2018)</strong> includes the detailed Plan for 2017–22 and the perspective plan for 2022–27.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The NEP 2022-32:</strong> The plan document includes the <strong>review</strong> of the last five years (2017-22), a detailed plan for the next five years (<strong>2022-27</strong>) and the <strong>prospective plan</strong> for the next five years (2027-32).</p>
<p><strong>Key projections of the NEP 2022-32:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Installed capacity:</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>By 2026-27</em></strong><strong>, it would be 609,591 MW, comprising –</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>273,038 MW of conventional capacity</strong> (coal-235,133 MW, gas-24,824 MW, nuclear-13,080 MW) and</li>
<li><strong>336,553 MW of renewable-based capacity</strong> (large hydro-52,446 MW, solar-185,566 MW, wind-72,895 MW, small hydro-5,200 MW, biomass-13,000 MW, pump storage plants-7,446 MW).</li>
<li>The renewable-based capacity also includes a <strong>Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)</strong> capacity of 8,680 MW/34,720 MWh.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>By 2031, it is estimated to be 900,422 MW comprising –</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>304,147 MW of conventional capacity</strong> (coal-259,643 MW, gas–24,824 MW, nuclear-19,680 MW) and</li>
<li><strong>596,275 MW (66%) of renewable-based capacity</strong> (large hydro-62,178 MW, solar-364,566 MW, wind-121,895 MW, small hydro-5,450 MW, biomass-15,500 MW, pump storage plants-26,686 MW).</li>
<li><strong>BESS capacity</strong> – 47,244 MW/236,220 MWh.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key takeaways from the NEP 2022-32:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Renewable energy target:</strong> While India has committed to half its installed electricity being sourced from renewable sources by 2030, <strong>this target may be achieved by 2026-27.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The share of non-fossil-based capacity:</strong> It is likely to increase to <strong>4% by 2026-27, and 68.4% by 2031-32 from around 42.5%</strong> as of April 2023.</li>
<li><strong>Ambitious but possible targets:</strong> These targets are premised on significant support by the government to industry.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Concerns:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Old targets have fallen short of reality</strong>: <em>For example,</em> the Centre had committed to installing 100 GW (1 GW is equal to 1,000 MW) of solar power by 2022 but only managed about 64 GW.</li>
<li><strong>Installed capacity does not perfectly translate into generated power:</strong> As different sources of energy have varying degrees of availability and efficiency.<ul>
<li><strong>For instance</strong>, solar power is available only during the day and wind energy is dependent on climate vagaries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead (as per the National Electricity Plan for 2022-27):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The hybrid generation models:</strong> This will enable a shift to solar energy and provide backup power.</li>
<li><strong>The water-based systems:</strong> In these systems, water is raised to the reservoir during charging, and when it is discharged, it produces energy.</li>

<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Changes in Industrial Policy and Their Effects on Industrial Growth</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/india-semiconductor-manufacturing-industry-8640475/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> India’s ambition of <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/09/27/a-push-for-the-semiconductor-industry/">manufacturing semiconductor chips</a> appears to be taking longer to materialize.</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Three entities</strong> (Vedanta-Foxconn, international consortium ISMC and Singapore-based IGSS Ventures) that had applied to build the chips are <strong>facing hurdles in setting up their manufacturing plants in India.</strong></li>
<li>The Centre, which expects its semiconductor market to be <strong>worth $63 billion by 2026</strong>, had received three proposals to set up a fab (fabrication/production) in the country.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are the hurdles?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vedanta-Foxconn struggles to find a tech partner</strong> that could licence them the technology to manufacture 28-nanometre chips.</li>
<li><strong>ISMC</strong> (backed by Abu Dhabi-based Next Orbit and Israel’s Tower Semiconductor) has asked not to consider its proposal owing to a pending merger between Intel and Tower Semiconductor</li>
<li><strong>Singapore-based IGSS Venture’s</strong> proposal was not found to be up to the mark by the government’s advisory committee.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Semiconductors:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/app.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/app.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Semiconductors are materials which have a conductivity between –<ul>
<li><strong>Conductors</strong> (generally metals) at high temperatures and</li>
<li><strong>Non-conductors or insulators</strong> (such as most ceramics) at low temperatures</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Semiconductors/integrated circuits (ICs)/microchips can be <strong>pure</strong> elements, such as silicon or germanium, or <strong>compounds</strong> such as gallium arsenide or cadmium selenide.</li>
<li><strong>Small amounts of impurities called doping</strong> are added to pure semiconductors causing large changes in the conductivity of the material.</li>
<li><strong>Due to the semiconductor chip shortage in recent years,</strong> the global automobile manufacturing industry is particularly affected.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why is India pushing for semiconductor manufacturing?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>India has identified electronics manufacturing</strong> as a key sector to boost its growth by producing goods not just for the domestic market, but also for global markets.</li>
<li>While <strong>smartphone</strong> manufacturing has taken off in the country with Apple taking the lead, the entire process is largely centred around <strong>assembling various imported components.</strong></li>
<li><strong>India has made chip manufacturing a top priority</strong> (by luring global companies) for its economic strategy to<ul>
<li><strong>Develop a domestic electronics supply chain</strong> and</li>
<li><strong>Reduce its imports</strong>, especially from China</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Govt. efforts – Semicon India Programme:</strong> Launched in 2021 with an outlay of Rs 76,000 crore, the programme seeks to support the development of the semiconductors and the display manufacturing ecosystem in India.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/govt.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/govt.png" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Impact of the above hurdles on India:</strong> It will affect the country’s ambitious target of becoming <strong>a global semiconductor hub in the next five years.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Decision taken by the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY):</strong> It will reopen the window for applying to its <strong>Rs 76,000 crore semiconductor manufacturing plan.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As more companies try to diversify their bases from China, <strong>India has an opportunity to emerge as a reliable destination.</strong></li>
<li>On the lines of the <strong>USA’s CHIPS Act</strong>, India can also provide subsidies for manufacturing chips in the country.</li>

<h4 id="gs3gs1"><strong>GS3/GS1</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus: Agriculture/ Geography: Irrigation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.livemint.com/news/india/over-50-of-india-s-cultivated-land-now-has-assured-irrigation-thanks-to-expansion-in-micro-projects-and-efficient-water-use-11685555001532.html"><strong>LM</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> In 2022-23, of the <strong>210 million hectares of gross sown area, about 115 million hectares, or nearly 55%</strong>, had irrigation access, up from <strong>47.8% in 2013-14,</strong> according to state-run think-tank Niti Aayog member Ramesh Chand.</p>
<p><strong>What is ‘assured irrigation’?</strong></p>
<p>Assured irrigation refers to the <strong>provision of reliable and guaranteed water supply</strong> for agricultural purposes. Assured irrigation systems can include <strong>canals, drip irrigation, sprinklers</strong>, and other methods that efficiently deliver water to crops.</p>
<p><strong>Importance of ‘assured irrigation’</strong>:</p>
<p>It ensures that cultivated land has access to a sufficient and regular water source, reducing dependence on rainfall and minimizing the risk of crop failure due to water scarcity.</p>
<p><strong>Data about water use:</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>Agriculture accounts for about <strong>80% of India’s available water use of 700 billion cubic metres</strong></li>
<li>The monsoon rainfall in <strong>June-September</strong>, which waters the Kharif or summer-sown crops, plays a crucial role in farm production.</li>
<li>Agriculture accounts for about <strong>18% of the national economy</strong> and is the <strong>largest employer.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Out of the total irrigated area, 40%</strong> is currently <strong>watered through canal networks</strong>, and <strong>60% through groundwater.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Factors behind increasing assured irrigation in India:</strong></p>

<tr>
<td><strong>Government Initiatives</strong></td>
<td><strong>Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) (launched in 2015)</strong> focuses on creating sources for assured irrigation, reducing water wastage, and improving water use efficiency. The scheme incentivizes micro-irrigation through subsidies and promotes rainwater harvesting at a micro-level.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td><strong>Har Khet Ko Paani-Surface Minor Irrigation</strong>: It focuses on harnessing surface water sources for irrigation in areas where groundwater resources are limited through the construction of <strong>small-scale irrigation structures like check dams, farm ponds, and percolation tanks</strong> to capture and store rainwater.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>A <strong>₹500 billion micro-irrigation fund (MIF)</strong> was created with the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) to support states in mobilizing resources.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td><strong>Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP)</strong> and special packages for certain states have contributed to the expansion of irrigation infrastructure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Canal projects</strong></td>
<td>E.g., Eastern Rajasthan Canal Project (ERCP); Shahpur-Kandi project</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Impact</strong>: This expansion is attributed to the <strong>growth of micro-projects that use water more</strong> efficiently, particularly in states like Telangana, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and Karnataka.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>About 40% of the cultivable area</strong> will still depend on rainfall due to geographical and hydrological limitations.</li>
<li>Over-dependence on groundwater has led to the depletion of the water table in 64% district of India</li>
<li>Uneven rainfall distribution</li>
<li>Poor irrigation efficiency</li>
<li>The huge and increasing gap between created and utilized irrigation potential</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Assured irrigation <strong>plays a crucial role in reducing dependence</strong> on rainfall, improving water use efficiency, and enhancing agricultural productivity. The focus on assured irrigation is <strong>essential for sustainable agriculture</strong> and mitigating the <strong>impact of water scarcity</strong> on crop production in India.</p>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1928643"><strong>PIB</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: MeitY launches a pilot project on <strong>Electronics Repair Services Outsourcing (ERSO</strong>) to make <strong>India Global Repair Capital.</strong></p>
<p>Through the ERSO scheme, <strong>India hopes to capture 20% of the global repair service market</strong> – currently valued at $100 billion – in five years. At present, India’s revenue from <strong>repair services is about $350 million.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Significance:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Revenue potential</li>
<li>Extension of device life</li>
<li>Promote circularity</li>
<li>Employment</li>
<li>Boosting domestic manufacturing</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Right to Repair:</strong> </p>
<p>The Right to Repair refers to <strong>government legislation that is intended to allow consumers the ability to repair and modify their own consumer electronic devices</strong>, where otherwise the manufacturer of such devices requires the consumer to use only their offered services.</p>
<p>When customers buy a product, it is inherent that they must own it completely, for which the consumers should be able to repair and modify the product with ease and at a reasonable cost, without being captive to the whims of manufacturers for repairs.</p>
<p>The <strong>idea originally originated from the USA where the Motor Vehicle Owners’ Right to Repair Act 2012,</strong> required the manufacturers to provide the necessary documents and information to allow anyone to repair their vehicles.</p>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1928967"><strong>PIB</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: India’s biodiversity hotspot, the Western Ghats, is home to <strong>62 Desiccation-Tolerant Vascular Plant Species</strong> which could have applications in agriculture, particularly in areas with scarcity of water.</p>
<p><strong>What are Desiccation-tolerate plants?</strong> </p>
<p>Desiccation-tolerant vascular (DT) plants are able to <strong>withstand extreme dehydration</strong>, losing up to <strong>95% of their water content</strong>, and they <strong>revive themselves once water</strong> is available again. This unique ability allows them to <strong>survive in harsh, arid environments</strong> that would be uninhabitable for most other plants.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> Selaginella lepidophylla (Rose of Jericho); Xerophyta viscosa; Myrothamnus flabellifolius (Resurrection plant); Craterostigma plantagineum; Haberlea rhodopensis.</p>
<p><strong>What makes plants Desiccation-tolerant?</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Desiccation-tolerant plants have special adaptations</strong> (e.g., mechanisms to prevent cellular damage during dehydration; thick cuticle on leaves, which reduces water loss through evaporation etc., ) that allow them to survive extreme dehydration by losing a significant amount of water content and reviving when water becomes available again.</p>
<p><strong>What are Vascular plants?</strong></p>
<p>Vascular plants, also known as <strong>tracheophytes</strong>, are a group of plants that have specialized tissues for <strong>conducting water, nutrients, and sugars</strong> throughout their structures. These tissues are called vascular tissues and include the xylem and phloem.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> A recently discovered <strong>asteroid, named 2023 FW13</strong>, has been identified as a <strong>“quasi-moon” or “quasi-satellite</strong>” of Earth.</p>
<p><strong>What is “quasi-moon”?</strong></p>
<p>A quasi-moon is a term used to <strong>describe an asteroid or space rock that orbits</strong> the sun in a similar time frame as Earth but is only <strong>slightly influenced by Earth’s gravitational pull</strong>. It appears to accompany Earth during its yearly journey around the sun but is <strong>not a natural satellite like the moon.</strong></p>
<p><strong>About 2023 FW13:</strong> </p>
<p>It orbits the <strong>sun in a similar time frame as Earth</strong> but is only minimally affected by Earth’s gravitational pull. Estimated to be 50 feet in diameter, it comes within 9 million miles of Earth during its orbit. The asteroid was first observed in March and has likely been travelling alongside Earth since around 100 B.C. It is considered to be the <strong>longest-known quasi-satellite of Earth.</strong> Although it is in <strong>close proximity to Earth</strong>, there is no imminent risk of a collision. Another quasi-satellite called <strong>Kamo’oalewa was discovered in 2016,</strong> which may potentially be a fragment of Earth’s moon.</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: Lion and leopard populations have experienced a remarkable recovery in <strong>Zambia’s Kafue National Park (KNP), Africa’s third-largest national park,</strong> after decades of poaching, according to a report by Panthera and its partners.</p>
<p>The use of advanced conservation technologies, such as <strong>SMART and EarthRanger</strong>, anti-poaching measures, and distribution of <strong>synthetic ‘Heritage Furs’</strong> replacing garments made of authentic leopard and lion skins, along with innovative strategies like <strong>vultures as early warning systems,</strong> has improved the population.</p>
<p>Zambia (name from the Zambezi River), in southern Africa, is a <strong>landlocked country</strong> of <strong>rugged terrain and diverse wildlife</strong>, with many parks and safari areas. On its border with Zimbabwe is the famed <strong>Victoria Falls</strong> – plunging a misty 108m into the narrow Batoka Gorge.</p>
