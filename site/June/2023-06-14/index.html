<h4 id="gs-paper-2"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Mechanisms for the Protection and Betterment of Vulnerable Sections</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/urban-centres-must-be-disabled-friendly-inclusivity-is-a-theme-in-indias-g20-presidency-8657607/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Assistive technology – products, equipment, and systems that enhance learning, working, and daily living for persons with disabilities (PwD) – can aid PwD, enabling their full participation in urban life.</p>
<p><strong>Need for inclusive cities:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>India is urbanising rapidly</strong> and the country’s urban population is <strong>estimated to cross 675 million by 2030.</strong><ul>
<li>According to the 2011 Census, 1 in 3 PwD in India or <strong>roughly 8 million people already live in cities</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The number of PwD as a share of the population could rise</strong> due to disaster and climate risks, demographic changes and broader definitions of disability in line with global norms.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Solution – Innovative technology and ICT:</strong> These are key to ensuring an <strong>inclusive urban transformatio</strong>n and <strong>essential for improving and increasing the quality of life</strong> of all citizens.</p>
<p><strong>Importance of assistive technology:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manasi Joshi</strong>, a para-badminton player, underwent a double leg amputation following a road accident at age 22.</li>
<li><strong>Availability of assistive technology</strong> empowered her by not only helping her overcome obstacles she faced in everyday tasks but also encouraging her to realise her dream of playing professional badminton.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advantages to India:</strong> India has a <strong>world-class digital governance system</strong> and dynamic tech sectors converging to deliver inclusive prosperity and resilience.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong> Innovations that promote inclusivity are often perceived as <strong>unprofitable</strong> by investors.</p>
<p><strong>Steps taken:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Smart Solutions Challenge and Inclusive Cities Awards:</strong> It was launched in India (2022) by the National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA) and the UN, <strong>to enhance the ecosystem for assistive technology and inclusive solutions.</strong><ul>
<li>It helped in <strong>crowd-sourcing tech-based solutions and innovations</strong> for addressing city-level accessibility and inclusion challenges.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Start-up 20 Engagement Group:</strong> As part of its G20 Presidency, India has initiated the group to provide a global platform to enable the start-up ecosystem across the member nations.</li>
<li><strong>G20 Digital Innovation Alliance (G20-DIA):</strong> Launched by MeitY to showcase innovative solutions and create an alliance of players in the innovation ecosystem.</li>
<li><strong>Urban-20 Engagement Group under G20:</strong> It seeks to discuss how data and technology can be best utilised for making city management more effective and inclusive [Theme – ‘Catalysing Digital Urban Futures’].</li>
<li><strong>Artificial Limbs Manufacturing Corporation (ALIMCO):</strong> Incorporated in 1972, ALIMCO is a <strong>Central Public Sector unit</strong> engaged in the manufacture and supply/distribution of Assistive Devices for PwDs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The role of the state becomes critical</strong> for promoting an ecosystem for transformative technologies, especially where the return on investment may be difficult to measure.</li>
<li><strong>Behavioural changes, capacity building, investments and policies</strong> for accessible infrastructure and inclusive and accessible innovations for creating an inclusive and accessible India.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best practices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Smart cities like Bhubaneswar</strong> have deployed innovative transport and mobility solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Fifth Sense, IncluMaps, AxcessAble and myUDAAN:</strong> These are the assistive technologies supporting independent living for PwD.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Accessible India is crucial for the country’s progress towards <strong>SDG targets and</strong> <strong>an equitable urban future as envisioned for the Amrit Kaal</strong> – an inclusive, accessible, safe, resilient, and sustainable India@2047.</p>

<td><strong>1945</strong></td>
<td>The United States initially joined UNESCO in 1945, seeing it as an important <strong>platform for promoting international cooperation</strong> in education, science, and culture.</td>
<td>The U.S. believed in the importance of international cooperation and saw UNESCO as a means to promote its values and interests in these areas.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>1984</strong></td>
<td>In 1984, under the <strong>Reagan administration</strong>, the U.S. withdrew from the organization.</td>
<td>The Reagan administration believed that UNESCO was not effectively fulfilling its mandate, and was <strong>mismanaged and corrupt</strong>. Its actions were influenced by <strong>political biases that favoured the Soviet Union.</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>2003</strong></td>
<td>The U.S. rejoined UNESCO in 2003 under the <strong>George W Bush</strong> administration.</td>
<td>This decision was driven by a desire to re-engage with multilateral institutions and rebuild diplomatic relationships.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>2011</strong></td>
<td>In 2011, the U.S. and Israel <strong>suspended their funding to UNESCO</strong> and eventually lost their voting rights.</td>
<td>The U.S. and Israel believed that UNESCO’s decision to admit Palestine undermined the prospects for Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations and took measures to protest against it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>2017</strong></td>
<td>In 2017, under the <strong>Trump administration</strong>, the U.S. announced its decision to withdraw from UNESCO altogether.</td>
<td>The Trump administration perceived UNESCO to have an <strong>anti-Israel bias</strong> and raised concerns about the <strong>effectiveness and value of the organization’s programs.</strong> The administration also expressed <strong>concerns about the effectiveness and value of UNESCO’s programs.</strong></td>
</tr>

<h4 id="gs-paper-3"><strong>GS Paper 3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Awareness in the fields of IT, Space, Computers, Robotics, Nano-technology, Bio-technology and issues relating to Intellectual Property Rights</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/hiroshima-ai-process-g7-explained/article66959829.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The 2023 annual G7 Summit, hosted by Japan (Hiroshima), initiated the Hiroshima AI Process (HAP) – an effort to determine a way forward to regulate artificial intelligence (AI).</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> The G7 Digital and Tech Ministers discussed <strong>responsible AI and global AI governance</strong> –</p>
<ul>
<li>To promote human-centric and trustworthy AI based on the OECD AI Principles and</li>
<li>To foster collaboration to maximise the benefits for all brought by AI technologies.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is HAP?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It recognised the need to immediately take stock of the <strong>opportunities and challenges of</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/12/generative-ai/#:~:text=What%20is%20Generative%20AI%3F,or%20other%20types%20of%20media."><strong>generative AI</strong></a><strong>,</strong> which is increasingly prominent across countries and sectors.</li>
<li><strong>It encourages discussions</strong> on generative AI in cooperation with the OECD and <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/06/16/global-partnership-on-artificial-intelligence-gpai/">GPAI</a> to conduct practical projects.</li>
<li><strong>These discussions</strong> could include topics such as <strong>governance, safeguard of IPR</strong> (including copyrights), response to foreign information manipulation (including disinformation) and responsible utilisation of these technologies.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance of the HAP:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It will highlight the shared values and standards</strong> that can be used to derive guiding principles (fairness, accountability, transparency, and safety) for the regulation of AI.</li>
<li><strong>AI development and implementation</strong> will help in aligning with values such as freedom, democracy and human rights.</li>
<li><strong>An emphasis on multi-stakeholder international cooperation</strong> indicates that the HAP isn’t expected to address AI regulation from a State-centric perspective.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Divergence among G7 countries.</strong></li>
<li><strong>G7 countries are acting on their own</strong> instead of waiting for the outcomes from the HAP.</li>
<li>The relationship between <strong>AI and IPR</strong> is not clear.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A common guideline for G7 countries</strong> that permits the use of copyrighted materials.</li>
<li><strong>An interoperable AI governance framework</strong> to respond to the concerns of other country groups as well.</li>
<li><strong>Like-minded approaches and policy instruments</strong> to achieve the common vision and goal of trustworthy AI.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Overall, the establishment of the HAP makes one thing clear: AI governance has become a truly global issue that is likely to only become more contested in future.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong>  Jack Dorsey, <strong>the former CEO of Twitter</strong>, claimed that <strong>the Indian government threatened to shut down the social media platform in the country.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Issues highlighted:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>India made numerous requests related to the farmers’ protests and critical journalists</strong>, and the government used tactics like raiding Twitter employees’ homes and threatening to close Twitter offices.</li>
<li><strong>India and China could apply pressure on Elon Musk</strong>, who has business interests in those countries, to influence Twitter’s policies.</li>
<li>The Indian government had <strong>demanded the shutdown of certain accounts and the disclosure of contact information.</strong></li>
<li>The government sought to censor tweets <strong>critical of their handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, and there were claims that Twitter censored right-wing voices</strong>.</li>
<li>The government is <strong>also considering a Digital India Bill</strong> that m<strong>ay eliminate the safe harbour concept and increase legal consequences for platforms</strong> that do not remove government-notified misinformation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other issues influencing the idea of Digital India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A data breach on the <strong>CoWIN platform was reported,</strong> but the government denied it.</li>
<li>Second, a <strong>Global DPI Summit organized by the Ministry of Electronics and IT took place, emphasizing the Digital Public Infrastructure framework.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>These events <strong>demonstrate the lack of governance processes, accountability mechanisms, and adherence to constitutional frameworks in India’s digital systems.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ethical issues involved in the case:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Freedom of speech and expression</strong>: Critics argue that by blocking accounts and content, Twitter may be suppressing dissenting voices and limiting the free flow of information.</li>
<li><strong>Impartiality and bias</strong>: Accusations of political bias can undermine trust in the platform and raise questions about the fairness of its content moderation practices.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with local laws</strong>: Critics argue that Twitter’s compliance with Indian laws may compromise its commitment to global human rights principles.</li>
<li><strong>Corporate responsibility and accountability:</strong> Ethical concerns arise when executives make claims that are disputed by the government or other stakeholders.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy and user data protection</strong>: Governments’ requests for user information and potential surveillance can infringe upon users’ privacy rights and raise questions about the platform’s commitment to protecting user data.</li>
<li><strong>Relationship with governments:</strong> Ethical considerations come into play when platforms must navigate demands from governments that may infringe on human rights or limit freedom of expression.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Addressing these ethical issues requires a <strong>careful balance between respecting local laws, protecting user rights, ensuring transparency and accountability</strong>, and upholding global human rights standards. It highlights the need for <strong>robust policies and practices within social media companies to navigate these complex ethical challenges effectively</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/kari-ishad-mango-of-ankola-in-uttar-karnataka-gets-gi-tag/article66899782.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The <strong>Kari Ishad mango</strong> prominently grown in <strong>Ankola taluk of Uttara Kannada</strong> has bagged the <strong>Geographical Indication (GI) tag</strong> from the Geographical Indications Registry under the Union Government.</p>
<ul>
<li>According to the Geographical Indications Journal of the government, the <strong>Kari Ishad is accepted as one of the finest quality mangoes due to its unique aroma, luscious taste, high amount of pulp</strong>, shape, and size.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About GI tag:</strong></p>
<p>A GI is primarily an <strong>agricultural, natural or manufactured product (handicrafts and industrial goods) originating from a definite geographical territory.</strong></p>
<p><strong>How long the registration of Geographical Indication is valid?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The registration of a geographical <strong>indication is valid for a period of 10 years.</strong></li>
<li>It can be renewed from <strong>time to time for a further period of 10 years each.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Who accords and regulates Geographical Indications?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>At the International level</strong>: Geographical Indications are covered as a component of <strong>intellectual property rights (IPRs) under the Paris Convention</strong> for the Protection of Industrial Property. GI is also governed by the <strong>World Trade Organisation’s (WTO’s) Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS).</strong></li>
<li>In India, Geographical Indications registration is administered by the <strong>Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999</strong> which came into force with effect from September 2003. The first product in India to be accorded with GI tag was Darjeeling tea in the year 2004-05.</li>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/rbi-permits-loan-default-guarantee-in-digital-lending-to-boost-fintech-activity-8654538/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The RBI has allowed a <strong>Default loss guarantee (DLG) (also called first Loss Default Guarantee (FLDG)</strong>, a safety-net arrangement among banks, non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) and lending service providers (LSPs).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FLDG.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FLDG.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>LSPs:</strong> These are new-age technology platforms/ agents (of a bank or NBFC) in the lending space who carry out one or more of a lender’s functions on behalf of regulated entities (REs).</p>
<p><strong>What is an FLDG arrangement?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is an arrangement whereby <strong>a third party</strong> such as a financial technology (fintech) player (LSP) <strong>compensates lenders if the borrower defaults.</strong></li>
<li>For all practical purposes, <strong>credit risk is borne by the LSP</strong> without having to maintain any regulatory capital.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Previous arrangement:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>RBI had expressed reservations about the FLDG arrangement because it felt that <strong>the model could pose a systemic risk.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The RBI guidelines (2022)</strong> on digital lending did not provide clarity on the FLDG structure.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>New guidelines:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The RBI <strong>permitted FLDG arrangements</strong> between banks and fintech or between two REs.</li>
<li>The LSP-providing DLG must be incorporated as a company under the <strong>Companies Act, 2013.</strong></li>
<li>Banks and NBFCs should ensure that the total amount of DLG cover on any outstanding portfolio <strong>does not exceed 5% of the amount of that loan portfolio.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance:</strong> This will facilitate the entry of small and medium fintech into the digital lending space in partnerships with banks or NBFCs.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Researchers at IIT Kanpur have developed <strong>India’s first 100% Dimethyl Ether (DME)-fuelled tractor/vehicle</strong>, marking a significant step towards a sustainable alternative fuel-based transport system.</p>
<p><strong>What is Dimethyl Ether?</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Dimethyl Ether (DME) is a renewable and clean-burning alternative fuel</strong> that can be used in various applications, including <strong>transportation</strong>. Under normal atmospheric conditions, <strong>DME is a colourless gas</strong>.  It is produced from <strong>natural gas, coal, biomass, or renewable sources</strong> through a synthesis process.</p>
<p><strong>Uses</strong>: It is used extensively in the chemical industry and as a <strong>solvent, fuel, and refrigerant (</strong>ozone-friendly aerosol propellant to replace CFCs). DME has <strong>properties similar to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)</strong> and can be easily stored and transported.</p>
<p>Several countries, including <strong>Japan, the USA, China, Sweden, Denmark, and Korea</strong>, already use DME to power vehicles. However, the use of DME in internal combustion engines is relatively unexplored in India.</p>
<p>The research is overheated by the <strong>Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB)</strong> (under the Department of Science and Technology (DST) and is aligned with the <strong>‘Methanol Economy’</strong> program of NITI Ayog.</p>
