<h4 id="gs-paper-2"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Parliament – Structure, Functioning, Conduct of Business, Powers &amp; Privileges and Issues Arising out of these</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/a-parliamentary-democracy-or-an-executive-democracy/article66916867.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> A new Parliament building was inaugurated with both celebration and controversy.</p>
<p><strong>Controversy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The exclusion of the President of India</strong> – the formal head of the executive – from the inauguration.</li>
<li><strong>The symbolism around the Sengol</strong> – was originally used to signify the transfer of power between Chola rulers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>An overlooked fact:</strong> The increasing subordination of the Parliament in India’s parliamentary democracy.</p>
<p><strong>Parliamentary democracy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is a system of government in which citizens elect representatives to a legislative parliament <strong>to make the necessary laws and decisions</strong> for the country.</li>
<li>This parliament directly represents the people.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/democracy.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/democracy.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Issues faced by the Indian Parliament:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frequent adjournments:</strong> Parliament sits for fewer and fewer days in a year and Bills are passed with minimal or no deliberation.</li>
<li><strong>Frequent use of ordinance route:</strong> The presidential ordinances have become a parallel if not dominant form of law-making.</li>
<li><strong>The concentration of power:</strong> Within a dominant executive.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Safeguards against executive dominance or abuse:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The executive must command a majority</strong> in Parliament. This opens up the space for <strong>intra-party dissent</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>The Opposition</strong> is granted certain rights in Parliament to hold the executive accountable.</li>
<li><strong>The Speaker</strong> – a neutral and independent authority, represents the interests of Parliament against the executive<strong>.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Bicameralism</strong>e., a second “Upper House” that acts as a revising chamber, where interests other than those of the brute majority are represented.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Problems with the above safeguards:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Tenth Schedule to the Constitution:</strong> The possibility of intra-party dissent within Parliament has been eliminated by virtue of <strong>anti-defection law</strong>.<ul>
<li><strong>Enacted to curb horse trading, it penalises disobedience of the party whip</strong> with disqualification from the House.</li>
<li><strong>It has strengthened the hand of the party leadership</strong> – cabinet/executive (in the case of the ruling party), against its own parliamentarians.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Opposition enjoys no specific Constitutional powers:</strong> The manner of proceedings in Parliament is under the complete control of the executive, with no real constitutional checks.</li>
<li><strong>The Speaker is not independent:</strong> S/he is not required to give up membership of their political party, and is not constitutionally obligated to act impartially.<ul>
<li>This has led to an increasing trend of Speakers acting in a <strong>partisan manner</strong> to advance the interests of the executive over the interests of the House.</li>
<li><strong>This affects the quality of the deliberations</strong> in the lower house.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The role of the Upper House is undercut:</strong> Not only by the Speaker’s misclassification of Bills (as a “money bill”) but also by the constitutionally-sanctioned ordinance making power.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The only effective check upon the executive:</strong> When the electorate has thrown up a <strong>fractured</strong> mandate and the ruling party is forced to govern in a <strong>coalition</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The urgent question that needs to be asked:</strong> Whether India remains a parliamentary democracy, or has gradually morphed into an executive democracy?</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The quality of parliamentary deliberations has declined because of <strong>Parliament’s own structural marginalisation</strong> under the Constitution.</li>
<li>Therefore, if India wants to return to parliamentarianism, necessary constitutional changes and reforms should form the ethos of the new Parliament.</li>

<p><strong>The role of individual MPs (Members of Parliament) has diminished over the years and as a result healthy constructive debates on policy issues are not usually witnessed. How far can this be attributed to the anti-defection law, which was legislated but with a different intention? (UPSC 2013)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: India has played a significant role in the United Nations peacekeeping missions over the past 75 years. This is in continuation of the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/30/75-years-of-un-peacekeeping-forces/">FFP article published two days ago.</a></p>
<p>The <strong>UN Peacekeeping</strong>, guided by the <strong>Department of Peace Operations</strong>, aims to assist <strong>conflict-torn countries</strong> in their journey towards sustained peace. Indian personnel have made substantial contributions to these missions, <strong>currently ranking third in terms</strong> of the number of peacekeepers deployed.</p>
<p>Indian peacekeepers have served in <strong>various UN missions worldwide</strong>, with a current deployment of <strong>6,097 personnel</strong>. However, India has also <strong>experienced the highest number of fatalities</strong> due to malicious acts during these missions. Out of the <strong>71 peacekeeping operations conducted so far</strong>, <strong>three missions stand out</strong> with significant Indian troop casualties.</p>

<p><strong>Is UN Peacekeeping losing its appeal?</strong></p>
<p>UN Peacekeeping is <strong>losing its appeal</strong> due to several factors. The collapse of the Soviet Union <strong>ended the need for an impartial army to mediate between</strong> the United States and the Soviet Union. Modern conflicts are too messy and chaotic for traditional peacekeeping methods to be effective. The factions that once allowed for easy ceasefires no longer exist. There is also a <strong>lack of public support in Western nations</strong> for costly and risky peacekeeping missions. This lack of support is leading to reduced <strong>involvement and mission endings</strong>, as seen in France’s counterterrorism mission in Mali.</p>
<p><strong>Way forward and Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Proposed reforms for the future of UN peacekeeping include implementing the <strong>recommendations from the Brahimi Report</strong>, which aim to address flaws and improve the efficiency of peacekeeping missions. These reforms involve <strong>harmonizing the conditions of service for field and headquarters staff and developing guidelines</strong> and standard operating procedures. Additionally, there is a need for a <strong>rapid reaction force administered by the UN and deployed by the Security Council</strong> to ensure quick deployment in the event of genocide. India has been advocating for <strong>more administrative control of UN forces</strong> for the countries contributing most to it.</p>

<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Effects of Liberalisation on the Economy, Changes in Industrial Policy and Their Effects on Industrial Growth</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/unboxing-the-export-turnaround-in-indias-toy-story/article66912844.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a> </p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> India has recently turned a net exporter of toys (in 2020-21 and 2021-22), ending decades of import dominance.</p>
<p><strong>An overview of the Indian toy industry:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In 2015-16</strong>, the industry had about <strong>15,000 enterprises</strong> (in both organised and unorganised sectors), producing toys worth ₹1,688 crores and employing 35,000 workers.<ul>
<li><strong>Registered factories</strong> (employing 10 or more workers) <strong>accounted for 1% of the number of factories and enterprises</strong>, employed 20% of workers, and produced 77% of the value of output.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Between 2000 and 2016</strong>, industry output was halved in real terms (net of inflation) with job losses.<ul>
<li><strong>Imports</strong> rose by nearly three times as much as exports and accounted for up to 80% of domestic sales.</li>
<li><strong>India hardly figures in the global toy trade</strong>, with its exports at a mere half a percentage point.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Between 2014-19</strong>, the Indian toy industry witnessed <strong>negative</strong> productivity growth.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Evolution of the Indian toy industry:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Asia’s successful industrialising nations <strong>promoted toy exports for job creation</strong>, starting with Japan (a century ago), China (since the 1980s) and currently Vietnam.</li>
<li>However, <strong>India followed an inward-oriented industrial policy</strong> in the Planning era. This sheltered domestic production through <strong>import tariffs and reservation policy.</strong><ul>
<li>Thus, toy manufacturing remained stagnant, archaic and fragmented in India.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>With the LPG reforms in India in the 1990s</strong>, new firms entered the organised toy manufacturing sector and productivity growth improved.<ul>
<li>Despite early positive trends, industry de-reservation <strong>failed to sustain output, investment, and productivity growth after 2007-08</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recent data related to toy trade in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Toy exports increased</strong> from $109 million (₹812 crore) to $177 million (₹1,237 crore) between 2018-19 and 2021-22.</li>
<li><strong>Imports declined</strong> from $371 million (₹2,593 crore) to $110 million (₹819 crore).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The achievement is widely credited to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The ‘Make in India’ initiative</strong> launched in 2014.</li>
<li><strong>Basic custom duty</strong> on toys tripled from 20% to 60% in 2020.</li>
<li><strong>Numerous non-tariff barriers</strong> (such as production registration orders and safety regulation codes) were imposed as well.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The potential for <strong>sustaining net exports appears slim</strong> as the industry has hardly made sustained investments to boost output and exports.</li>
<li><strong>Rise in protectionism</strong>, COVID-19 pandemic.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong> Examine the ground reality of industrial locations and clusters to tailor policies and institutions to nurture the labour-intensive toy industry in India.</p>

<p>France has implemented a <strong>ban on domestic short-haul flights</strong> that can be replaced by train journeys of up to two-and-a-half hours, in an effort to reduce carbon emissions. However, critics argue that the <strong>ban may lead to an increase in car usage</strong>, negating the environmental benefits.</p>
<p>While air transport contributes <strong>only about 2% of global CO2 emissions</strong>, it is a concern due to its rapid growth and the fact that emissions from international flights are not attributed to any specific country.</p>
<p>In 2016, the <strong>International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) established the CORSIA offset mechanism</strong> to compensate for any emission increases beyond 2020 levels by <strong>investing in carbon-saving projects.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Usage</strong>: The example can be used in Environment/ Essay paper to argue carbon emission mitigation strategies.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Scientists have used machine learning to discover a potential new antibiotic called abaucin, which targets the highly resistant Acinetobacter baumannii bacteria.</p>
<p><strong>What is Acinetobacter baumannii bacteria?</strong> </p>
<p>Acinetobacter baumannii is a <strong>Gram-negative bacteria</strong> known for its ability to develop resistance to many antibiotics. It is a <strong>major cause of hospital-acquired infections</strong> and is <strong>considered a “red alert” pathogen</strong>. A. baumannii has a <strong>protective outer membrane</strong> that allows it to <strong>resist antibiotics</strong>, making it challenging to treat.</p>
<p><strong>What is the threat?</strong></p>
<p>It is commonly found in the environment, like in soil and water. It can cause infections in blood, urinary tract, and lungs, or in wounds. WHO has classified it as a critical threat among its <strong>“priority pathogens</strong>” – a group of bacteria families that pose the <strong>greatest threat to human health.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Working of abaucin:</strong></p>
<p>Abaucin works by <strong>disrupting the normal function of a protein called CCR2</strong> in bacteria. This disruption affects the <strong>movement of certain molecules</strong> inside the bacteria, preventing them from <strong>reaching the outer membrane</strong>. As a result, the growth of Acinetobacter baumannii is inhibited, making it less able to cause infections. Abaucin is selective in its action and <strong>mainly targets Acinetobacter baumannii</strong>, leaving other bacteria unharmed.</p>
<p><strong>About Gram-negative bacteria:</strong></p>
<p>It is a type of bacteria characterized by its <strong>cell structure and response</strong> to a staining method called the Gram stain. E.g., Escherichia coli (E. coli), Salmonella</p>

<p><strong>What are Permanent Magnets?</strong></p>
<p>A permanent magnet is a type of magnet that can <strong>create a magnetic field without needing any external power source</strong>. It is called “permanent” because once it is magnetized, it can maintain its magnetism for a long time.</p>
<p>Permanent magnets are usually made from certain types of metals or alloys, such as iron, nickel, and cobalt, or rare earth elements like neodymium and samarium.</p>
<p><strong>What are Rare earth permanent magnets?</strong></p>
<p>Rare earth permanent magnets are a type of permanent magnet that is made <strong>from rare earth elements</strong>. Rare earth elements are a group of <strong>seventeen chemical elements</strong> in the periodic table, including elements such as <strong>neodymium, samarium, and dysprosium</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> A team of researchers recently discovered that a <strong>diet low in flavanols</strong> – a type of nutrient found in a variety of fruits, vegetables, and beverages such as tea, cocoa, or wine <strong>– plays a fundamental role in driving age-related memory loss.</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>These findings suggest that the ageing <strong>brain requires specific nutrients for optimal health</strong> in a similar way that the <strong>developing brain needs specific nutrients for proper development.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Flavanols:</strong></p>
<p>Flavanols are <strong>a type of flavonoid, a class of compounds with antioxidant effects</strong>. Flavonoids are a <strong>diverse group of phytonutrients (plant chemicals) found in almost all fruits and vegetables</strong>. They are known for their health benefits, <strong>which are often attributed to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immune-boosting properties.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: A new <strong>Jupiter-size exoplanet with the highest density known to this date</strong> and mass 13 times that of Jupiter, has been discovered by ISRO.</p>
<ul>
<li>The discovery of this <strong>massive exoplanet was made using the indigenously made PRL Advanced Radial-velocity Abu-sky Search spectrograph (PARAS)</strong>.</li>
<li>The newly discovered exoplanet is found <strong>around the star called TOI4603 or HD 245134</strong>.</li>
<li>NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) initially declared TOI4603 as a <strong>possible candidate to host a secondary body of unknown nature.</strong></li>
<li>It is <strong>located 731 light years away</strong>. It orbits a <strong>sub-giant F-type star TOI4603 every 7.24 days</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>What sets this discovery apart is that the planet <strong>falls into the transition mass range of massive giant planets and low-mass brown dwarfs with masses ranging from 11 to 16 times the mass of Jupiter.</strong> Only fewer than five exoplanets are currently known in this mass range so far.</p>
<p><strong>About PARAS:</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>PRL optical fibre-fed high-resolution cross-dispersed echelle spectrograph</strong> (Prl Advanced Radial-velocity Abu-sky Search), was commissioned at the Mount Abu 1.2 m telescope in India in 2012.</p>
