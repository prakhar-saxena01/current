<p><strong>Significance of Raigarh Fort:</strong></p>
<p>Celebrations of the 350th anniversary of the coronation are being held at <strong>Raigad Fort in Maharashtra.</strong></p>
<p>At this fort, Shivaji was coronated in 1674. Here, he laid the foundation of <strong>“Hindavi-Swaraj”</strong> or the self-rule of Hindu people and also took the title Chhatrapati. It is a hill fort situated about <strong>25 km from Mahad in Raigad district</strong> and Early Europeans called it the <strong>Gibraltar of the East</strong>. Fort overlooks an artificial lake known as ‘<strong>Ganga Sagar Lake’</strong>. Shivaji was cremated at the fort in 1680.</p>
<p><strong>Ethical learnings from his life:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Responsible Use of Power</strong>: Shivaji demonstrated responsible use of power by serving the people’s interests and exemplifying the rule of the people.</li>
<li><strong>Respect for Diversity</strong>: Shivaji respected diversity by promoting the usage of local languages and traditions, and by maintaining a genuinely secular rule.</li>
<li><strong>Courage and Determination</strong>: Shivaji’s bravery and determination in facing larger and more powerful enemies teach us the importance of courage in overcoming challenges.</li>
<li><strong>Care for the Downtrodden:</strong> Shivaji cared for the downtrodden and farmers, highlighting the significance of empathy and compassion towards all members of society.</li>
<li><strong>Ethical Leadership:</strong> Shivaji’s focus on the well-being of his people and his adherence to ethical principles showcase the importance of ethical leadership in governance.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Shivaji Maharaj was a <strong>legendary Maratha warrior king</strong> who left a <strong>lasting impact on Indian history.</strong> His legacy continues to <strong>inspire generations</strong>, serving as a reminder of the virtues of <strong>justice, valour, and compassion</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-2"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Mechanisms, Laws, Institutions and Bodies constituted for the Protection and Betterment of Vulnerable Sections</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/only-66-districts-in-country-free-of-manual-scavenging-social-justice-ministry-report/article66938734.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> According to the Union Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment (MoSJ&amp;E), <strong>only 508 districts out of the total 766</strong> in the country have declared themselves manual-scavenging free.</p>
<p><strong>The practice of manual scavenging in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaning:</strong> Manual scavenging includes the disposal of human excreta manually from dry latrines, and public streets and the maintenance and sweeping of septic tanks, sewers and gutters.</li>
<li><strong>Prevalence in India:</strong> As many as <strong>58,000</strong> people worked as manual scavengers as of 2018. <strong>941 people have died since 1993</strong> due to accidents while undertaking hazardous cleaning of sewer and septic tanks.<ul>
<li>The practice, which is considered the worst remaining evidence of untouchability, is <strong>most prevalent among people from lower castes/Dalits.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Attempts to abolish manual scavenging:</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/law_say.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/law_say.png" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Salient features of the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act 2013:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It bans manual scavenging</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>It widened the definition of manual scavengers</strong> by including it in all forms of manual removal of human excreta.</li>
<li><strong>It lays</strong> a <strong>key focus on rehabilitating the manual scavengers</strong> by organising training programs (at a stipend of Rs. 3000) and offering scholarships to their children.</li>
<li>It makes the offence of manual scavenging <strong>cognizable and non-bailable.</strong></li>
<li>It makes it <strong>obligatory for employers to provide</strong> <strong>protective tools</strong> to the workers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other efforts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The scheme for rehabilitation of manual scavengers:</strong> Under this, ~58,000 identified sewer workers have been <strong>given a one-time cash payout of ₹40,000 each</strong>.<ul>
<li>In addition, ~22,000 of them have been connected to skills training programmes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>NAMASTE scheme:</strong> For 100% mechanisation of sewer work. The scheme for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers has now been merged with the NAMASTE scheme.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Concerns:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of funding:</strong> The Union Budget 2023-24 showed no allocation for the rehabilitation scheme and ₹100 crore allocation for the NAMASTE scheme.</li>
<li><strong>Less than half of the identified sewer workers</strong> are connected to skills training programmes.</li>
<li>Despite all efforts, manual scavenging is <strong>still practised in India.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All local bodies must <strong>identify and profile all septic tank/sewer workers</strong> in their respective areas.</li>
<li>Provide them with <strong>occupational training and safety equipment.</strong></li>
<li>Sign them up for health insurance under the <strong>Ayushman Bharat scheme.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best practice:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Bandicoot Robot</strong> is the world’s first robotic scavenger, developed as a Make in India and Swachh Bharat Abhiyan initiative by the startup Genrobotics.</li>
<li><strong>Kerala became the first state</strong> in the country to use robotic technology (Bandicoot) to clean all its commissioned manholes.</li>

<h4 id="gs-paper-3"><strong>GS Paper 3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Agricultural Produce and Issues and Related Constraints</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/how-india-has-become-relatively-atmanirbhar-in-pulses-compared-to-edible-oil-8645756/#:~:text=Private%20trade%20estimates%20of%20production,hardly%2040%25%20for%20edible%20oils."><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> As compared to edible oil, India has relatively achieved atma nirbharta (self-reliance)  in pulses.</p>
<p><strong>Edible oil production in India:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/produ.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/produ.png" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Import of edible oil by India:</strong> The quantum of imports has surged from ~<strong>8 mt to 16 mt</strong> between 2013-14 and 2022-23 (from ~$7 to 21 billion in value terms).</p>
<p><strong>Govt efforts to increase edible oil production:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>National Food Security Mission – Oilseeds and Oil Palm</strong> <strong>(NFSM-OS and OP):</strong> The government has been implementing this Centrally-sponsored scheme from 2018-19 to increase the production and productivity of oilseeds in the country.</li>
<li><strong>National Mission on Edible Oils (Oil Palm)</strong> [NMEO (OP)]</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Concerns:</strong> The productivity (yield) gap between improved technology and farmers’ practices ranged <strong>from 21% in sesame to 149% in sunflower.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Case of pulses:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>India is the <strong>largest</strong> producer (25% of global production), consumer (27% of world consumption) and importer (14%) of pulses in the world.</li>
<li>Though pulses are grown in both Kharif and Rabi seasons, <strong>Rabi pulses contribute more than 60% of the total production.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Import data: In quantity terms</strong>, India’s <strong>imports of pulses</strong> came down from <strong>6.61 mt in 2016-17</strong> to <strong>2.52 mt in 2022-23.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/impor.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/impor.jpg" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Breakup of India’s imports of major pulses:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/tones.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/tones.jpg" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Reasons behind the reduction in pulses imports:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Higher domestic production:</strong> India’s pulses output has increased from ~<strong>19 mt in 2013-14 to 28 mt in 2022-23</strong>, which translates into <strong>a self-sufficiency ratio of over 90% in pulses</strong> (40% for edible oils).</li>
<li><strong>Imports of chickpea (chana) have recorded dramatic drops:</strong> The boost to chana production came from two key government measures,<ul>
<li>The first is the levy of a 60% import duty on chana since March 2018.</li>
<li>The second intervention has been <strong>government procurement at minimum support prices (MSP).</strong></li>
<li><strong>These incentivised Indian farmers to expand the area under the pulses</strong> crop grown during the rabi (winter-spring) season.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Concerns:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arhar/Tur/pigeon pea is the problem:</strong> Arhar imports from Mozambique, Myanmar, Tanzania, Malawi and Sudan hit a record<strong>0.</strong><strong>9 mt in 2022-23.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Implications of imports:</strong> The overall import figures have not significantly reduced as a result of the erratic production of most non-chana pulses. <strong>This may result in inflation amid worries about El Nino.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The government must address <strong>micro-irrigation, quality seeds, marketing infrastructure and government policy issues</strong> to decrease dependency on imports.</li>
<li><strong>Technology and market support to farmers</strong> are the key to increasing oilseed production.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Given the significant impact that cities have on the environment, low-carbon cities are crucial to mitigate the effects of climate change.</p>
<p><strong>How are cities impacting climate?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In 2020, cities across the world <strong>dumped 29 trillion tonnes of CO2</strong> into the atmosphere.</li>
<li>This <strong>CO2</strong> along with other GHGs poses a <strong>serious health hazard</strong> and also <strong>manifests as extreme weather events</strong>, leading to the loss of lives and livelihoods.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges ahead:</strong> By 2050, 7 billion people will be living in cities.</p>
<p><strong>Need of the hour – A just energy-system transition:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This could reduce urban CO2 emissions <strong>by around 74%.</strong></li>
<li>The transition must be implemented <strong>both on the demand and the supply sides</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mitigation options on the supply side:</strong> Include phasing out fossil fuels and increasing the share of renewables in the energy mix, and using <strong>carbon capture and storage</strong> (CCS) technologies.</p>
<p><strong>On the demand side</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Using the <em>Avoid, Shift, Improve</em> framework</strong> – reducing and substituting the demand for fossil fuels with renewables.</li>
<li><strong>Addressing residual emissions</strong> in the energy sector by implementing <strong>CO2 removal (CDR) technologies.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why is a just energy transition needed?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A one-size-fits-all approach</strong> is unlikely to ensure a socially and environmentally just transition.<ul>
<li><strong>For example</strong>, transitioning to renewable energy sources could disproportionately affect communities and fossil fuels-dependent sectors in developing economies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Other concerns include</strong> land dispossession related to large-scale renewable energy projects, spatial concentration of poverty, gendered impacts, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance of Indian states to achieve energy transition goals:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>States as spheres of implementation</strong>: The realisation of national goals often depends on <strong>how they are aligned with State priorities and capabilities</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>States as laboratories of policy innovations</strong>: For example, PM KUSUM is a national adoption of successful State efforts on solarizing agriculture.</li>
<li><strong>The legacy issues must be addressed at the State level:</strong> Such as high losses, unreliable supply and service quality in the electricity sector.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Good news:</strong> With <strong>rapid advancements</strong> in clean energy and related technologies and reduced cost, the economic and technological barriers to implementing low-carbon solutions have been crossed.</p>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transitioning to low-carbon/net-zero cities</strong>: It is necessary to decarbonise urban systems.</li>
<li><strong>Sector-coupling approach:</strong> Integrate mitigation and adaptation options in multiple sectors, including energy, buildings, transportation, industry, and urban land use.</li>
<li><strong>A State-level framework:</strong> To understand plans, actions, and governance processes and to broaden the transition discourse.</li>
<li><strong>Different strategies for different cities:</strong> The considerations are a city’s spatial form, land-use pattern, level of development, and the state of urbanisation.<ul>
<li><strong>The strategies include</strong> energy-efficient services and infrastructure, people-centric urban design, and <strong>implementing building codes</strong> while gradually shifting to low-emission construction materials.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>For a just energy transition:</strong> The energy supply needs to be balanced against fast-growing energy demand (due to urbanisation), the need for energy security and exports.</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation and adaptation responses:</strong> Must engage multiple stakeholders in energy governance and decision-making, scaling up investments and capabilities, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In the upcoming G20 forum, <strong>India is planning to propose a multiple energy pathways</strong> approach to accommodate the diverse development trajectories of countries.</li>
<li>The diversity of India’s States, which necessitates multiple pathways, will determine its own domestic energy transition.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> A German factory in Hamburg has developed a process to <strong>convert cocoa bean shells into biochar,</strong> a black powder that has the potential to counter climate change.</p>
<p>The shells are heated in an <strong>oxygen-free environment</strong>, which locks in greenhouse gases and produces biochar that can be used as <strong>a fertilizer or as an ingredient in “green” concrete</strong>. <strong>Biochar</strong> has the ability to capture a <strong>significant amount of carbon dioxide (CO2)</strong> from the atmosphere.</p>
<p><strong>Usage</strong>: Indian government has also been emphasizing ‘biochar’. The example can be used in Agriculture/Environment Questions.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Bihar government plans to collaborate with the <strong>Geological Survey of India</strong> (GSI) to gather valuable geological information about <strong>magnetite-bearing rocks and ultramafic rocks in the region.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What are magnetite-bearing rocks?</strong></p>
<p>Magnetite-bearing rocks are rocks that contain magnetite, a <strong>black, opaque, and magnetic mineral.</strong> These rocks often exhibit magnetic anomalies and are known to host valuable minerals such as <strong>Chromite, Nickel, Platinum Group of Elements (PGE), and gold</strong>. Magnetite is one of the most <strong>abundant metal oxides</strong> and has various industrial applications. More often, magnetite occurs in its massive form, commonly called ‘<strong>lodestone’</strong></p>
<p><strong>What are ultramafic rocks?</strong></p>
<p>Ultramafic rocks are a type of igneous rock that have a <strong>high concentration of dark-coloured minerals rich in iron and magnesium</strong>. These rocks typically contain very little silica and are composed mainly of minerals such as <strong>olivine and pyroxene</strong>. Ultramafic rocks are associated with <strong>deep-seated mantle processes</strong> and are often found in areas where tectonic plates are <strong>converging</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> A study conducted by the University of Exeter shows that the public is aware of and accepts the use of bacteria-killing viruses, known as phage therapy, as an alternative to antibiotics.</p>
<p><strong>What is Phage therapy?</strong></p>
<p>Phage therapy is a treatment approach that uses <strong>bacteriophages,</strong> which are viruses that infect and kill specific bacteria. It involves using these viruses to <strong>target and destroy bacterial infections</strong>, serving as an alternative to antibiotics.</p>
<p><strong>How do they function?</strong></p>
<p>Phages are highly <strong>specific in their action</strong>, targeting only the specific bacteria they are programmed to attack, which can <strong>potentially reduce the risk of antibiotic resistance</strong>. Phage therapy has gained attention as a potential solution for <strong>antibiotic-resistant infections</strong> and is being explored as a promising avenue in medical research.</p>

<p><strong>What are Bacteriophages?</strong></p>
<p>Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria and use them as hosts for their replication. They are highly diverse and can target different types of bacteria. It was discovered by <strong>Frederick Willian Twort in 1915 (</strong>Great Britain) and Felix d’Herelle in 1917 (France)</p>
<p><strong>What is Antibiotic Resistance?</strong></p>
<p>Antibiotic resistance refers to the ability of bacteria or other microorganisms to withstand the <strong>effects of antibiotics,</strong> making them ineffective in treating infections caused by these resistant bacteria. By 2050, antibiotic resistance will result in the death of <strong>10 million people from drug-resistant diseases</strong> every year</p>
