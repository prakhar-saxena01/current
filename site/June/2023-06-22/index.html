<h4 id="gs-paper-2"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus: Governance: Appointment process</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/punjab-vidhan-sabha-passes-bill-that-empowers-state-govt-to-ap-8676325point-dgp/#:~:text=to%20appoint%20DGP-,The%20Aam%20Aadmi%20Party%20(AAP)%20government%20in%20Punjab%20Tuesday%20passed,DGP%20of%20its%20own%20choice."><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Punjab Vidhan Sabha, under the AAP government, has passed the Punjab <strong>Police (Amendment) Bill, 2023</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>This bill aims to <strong>amend and replace certain clauses</strong> in <strong>The Punjab Police Act, 2007</strong>, regarding the appointment of the state Director General of Police (DGP).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Major features of the Act:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The bill will grant the <strong>state government the authority to appoint a DGP of its choice</strong>.</li>
<li>The bill proposes the formation of a <strong>seven-member Empanelment Committee</strong> by the Punjab government.</li>
<li>The committee will <strong>select three senior-most officers</strong> from the pool of eligible officers based on their length of service, record, and experience to lead the police force.</li>
<li>The provisions of the <strong>bill will prevail over any court judgments, orders, or decrees</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Issues with the Bill:</strong></p>
<p>As per the guidelines laid down by the <strong>Supreme Court in the former DGP Prakash Singh case (2006)</strong> on police reforms, the state government is supposed to <strong>send a panel of eligible officers to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC)</strong>. UPSC then shortlists <strong>three officers from the panel</strong> and the state government would select an officer of its choice among those three.</p>
<p>In 2018, the Supreme Court ordered that <strong>any rule or law that goes against the guidelines</strong> should not be enforced. Therefore, the current bill goes against the Supreme Court’s direction and contradicts it.</p>
<p><strong>Punjab Government’s argument for the bill</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>“Public order” and “Police”</strong> fall under the state’s jurisdiction, as per the <strong>seventh schedule</strong> of the Constitution of India.</li>
<li><strong>A proper mechanism for the selection, appointment, and removal</strong> of the DGP is necessary, considering the specific challenges faced by Punjab as a border state.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Punjab has witnessed <strong>recent violent incidents involving Sikh separatists</strong> and a deteriorating law and order situation. However, this should <strong>not be used as a justification to disregard the Supreme Court’s directive</strong>. It is important to strike a balance between the state’s authority in appointing bureaucrats and ensuring adherence to legal and constitutional procedures.</p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-2_1"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Bilateral Agreements involving India and/or affecting India’s interests</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/explained-the-significance-of-indias-jet-engine-deal-with-us/article66992492.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> A mega defence deal for the manufacture of fighter jet engines in India is expected to dominate the agenda of the Indian PM’s ongoing official State Visit to the US.</p>
<p><strong>About the deal:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It will allow American manufacturing company <strong>General Electric (GE) Aerospace</strong> to share critical technology with <strong>Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL)</strong>.</li>
<li>This will help in the <strong>joint production of GE-F414 jet engines</strong> that will power indigenous Light Combat Aircraft <strong>(LCA) Tejas Mk-II.</strong></li>
<li>According to media reports, the U.S. has agreed to transfer <strong>~80% of the tech value to India</strong>, which is unprecedented.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Need for the deal:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>India has seen substantial accomplishments</strong> in various defence and space programmes and has also designed and built a fighter jet – LCA Tejas.</li>
<li>However, India hasn’t achieved much success in producing engines to power these aircraft.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>India’s quest for indigenous aero-engines:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The quest began in the 1960s</strong> with the country’s first indigenous fighter, <strong>HF-24 Marut</strong> – a supersonic jet, which failed to achieve its potential for want of a suitable engine.</li>
<li><strong>The Kaveri programme</strong> developed an indigenous military gas turbine engine for the ambitious LCA project in <strong>1986</strong>.<ul>
<li>The programme incurred an expenditure of over ₹2,000 crore, however, it <strong>failed to meet the necessary technical requirements.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>With Kaveri still a work in progress, <strong>India shortlisted American GE-F404 engines for LCA Tejas Mark-1</strong> as an interim measure.</li>
<li><strong>In 2010</strong>, the Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) selected the more powerful F414 engines to power Tejas Mark-2. The deal did not materialise due to <strong>US domestic legislation and regulatory hindrances.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What led to the finalisation of the recent deal?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>With an eye on China, <strong>the U.S. recognised India as a major defence partner in 2016</strong>, which paved the way for sharing of critical military equipment and technology.</li>
<li>It sought to put India <strong>on par with NATO member countries.</strong></li>
<li><strong>A new framework to strengthen strategic technology partnerships</strong> put the focus back on the GE-HAL deal at the inaugural meeting of the Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies (<strong>iCET</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are the features of the F414 engine?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It is a fully digital electronic system</strong> to control different aspects of the engine, known as the Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC).</li>
<li><strong>It is added with single-engine safety features</strong> customised to meet the country’s defence requirements.</li>
<li>The engines power several advanced, <strong>next-generation combat aircraft</strong> (Boeing’s F-18 Super Hornet and Saab’s JAS 39-Gripen) around the globe.</li>
<li>India will become the <strong>5th country</strong> in the world to produce jet engines once the deal is sealed, joining the U.S., Russia, France and the U.K.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance of the deal for India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Challenges faced by India:</strong> Dual-threat along its borders and maintaining strategic autonomy in the emerging world order.<ul>
<li>Therefore, <strong>self-reliance and technological transformation</strong> in the defence sector is the necessity for India.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The proposed deal –</strong><ul>
<li>Will be a <strong>significant step for bilateral defence</strong> and high-tech cooperation <strong>amid China’s growing influence and global technological dominance</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Will boost India’s military capabilities</strong> at the time of the <strong>Russia-Ukraine conflict.</strong></li>
<li>Will help replace the <strong>fleet of ageing Russian fighters</strong> with indigenously produced fighters.</li>
<li><strong>Will save decades of research and development costs.</strong></li>
<li>Overall, it will have a <strong>transformative impact on the aerospace and defence manufacturing industry</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The deal may elevate the U.S. as an alternative to India’s traditional dependence on Russian hardware, particularly amid rising concerns about Russia’s strategic embrace of China.</p>

<p><strong>Need for a new law:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The present law is 125 years old.</strong></li>
<li>Hence, a need has been felt <strong>to align it with the contemporary requirements</strong> and prevailing circumstances related to –<ul>
<li>Sanitary and phytosanitary measures, and</li>
<li>Its extant Allocation of Business Rules 1961</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Criticism of the draft Bill:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Animal rights organisations</strong> have said that the draft Bill will open a <strong>“Pandora’s Box”</strong> of cruelties on animals.</li>
<li><strong>Allowing the live export of animals from India</strong> is a free pass for the abuse of millions of animals farmed for food and other uses.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Govt’s response:</strong> Facing criticism, the Centre has withdrawn the draft Bill.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The issue involves sensitivity and emotions with animal welfare and related aspects, and, hence, would need wider consultation.</p>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://government.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/governance/one-nation-one-helpline-centre-to-integrate-child-helpline-with-erss-112/101153022"><strong>Economic Times</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Ministry of Women and Child Development in <strong>India has decided to integrate the women’s helpline and child helpline services</strong> with <strong>the Emergency Response Support System (ERSS-112) as part of the One Nation One Helpline vision</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>More about the News:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Childline service, which provides emergency outreach services for children in crisis, <strong>will now be accessible by dialling a four-digit toll-free number (1098) that connects to the ERSS-112.</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC)</strong> has been entrusted with automating the child helpline (1098) and integrating it with the ERSS-112.</li>
<li>The <strong>incoming calls to 1098 will be classified into emergency, non-emergency, and information calls,</strong> with emergency calls being forwarded to the ERSS-112.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Issues with the current service:</strong></p>
<p>Previously, the Childline service was supported by <strong>the Child Protection Services (CPS) scheme</strong> through the <strong>Childline India Foundation (CIF) and its partner NGOs</strong>. However, the current system <strong>lacked interoperability with other emergency services</strong>, <strong>causing delays in responding to distress calls</strong>. Additionally, some districts were left uncovered by the <strong>Childline service.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Significance:</strong></p>
<p>By integrating the child helpline with the ERSS-112, the government aims to <strong>improve the administration’s responsiveness and ensure seamless information flow</strong> for the repatriation and restoration of vulnerable children within and across districts and states.</p>

<h3 id="minimum-dietary-diversity-mdd"><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/22/minimum-dietary-diversity-mdd/">Minimum Dietary Diversity (MDD)</a></h3>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/health/dietary-diversity-can-help-stamp-out-child-malnutrition-in-india-90180"><strong>DTE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: Inadequate <strong>dietary diversity and meal frequency</strong> contribute to <strong>child malnutrition</strong> in India, including <strong>stunting and micronutrient deficiencies</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>What is Minimum Dietary Diversity?</strong></p>
<p>Minimum Dietary Diversity (MDD) refers to a <strong>recommended standard set by the World Health Organization (WHO) for children aged 6-23 months.</strong> It suggests that during the previous <strong>day or within 24 hours</strong>, children should consume foods and beverages from <strong>at least five of the eight defined food groups</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Aim of the MDD:</strong></p>
<p>It aims to ensure that <strong>children receive a diverse range of nutrients</strong> to meet their nutritional needs and promote their healthy growth and development.</p>
<p><strong>Status of MDD:</strong></p>
<p>India has a significantly <strong>low proportion of children (15 per cent)</strong> who meet MDD, followed by Nepal (34 per cent), which suggests that South Asian countries are trailing behind in terms of MDD</p>
<p><strong>Need of MDD:</strong></p>
<p>Poor-quality diets during the <strong>first two years of life</strong> can have long-lasting effects on a child’s health and development. India has <strong>high rates of child malnutrition</strong>, with a low proportion of children meeting the MDD.</p>
<p><strong>About WHO initiative:</strong></p>
<p>WHO has developed <strong>guidelines for Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) practices</strong>, with MDD being one of the core indicators. The eight food groups used for the tabulation of this indicator are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Breast milk</li>
<li>Grains products</li>
<li>Vegetables such as roots, tubers, plantains</li>
<li>Pulses (beans, peas, lentils)</li>
<li>Nuts, seeds</li>
<li>Dairy products (milk, infant formula, yoghurt, cheese)</li>
<li>Flesh foods (meat, fish, poultry, organ meats), eggs</li>
<li>Vitamin-A-rich fruits and vegetables</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Suggestions:</strong></p>
<p>Breast milk alone is <strong>not sufficient after 6-8 months</strong>, and complementary solid or semi-solid foods are necessary. <strong>Socioeconomic factors and maternal education</strong> play a significant role in MDD inequalities. National programs like the <strong>POSHAN Abhiyaan</strong> need to be strengthened further. Relying solely on <strong>supplements and fortification</strong> may not be enough.</p>
