<h4 id="gs-paper-1"><strong>GS Paper 1</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Indian Culture – Salient Aspects of Art Forms, Literature and Architecture from Ancient to modern times</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mandyas-hoysala-legacy-hidden-gems-that-beckon-history-buffs-attention/article66992768.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The temples in the Mandya district of Karnataka, belonging to the period of the Hoysalas, have failed to grab as much attention as they deserve.</p>
<p><strong>The Hoysala Empire:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hoysala.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hoysala.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>It was a <strong>Kannadiga power</strong> (founder – Sala) that ruled <strong>most of what is now Karnataka</strong> between the <strong>10th – 14th centuries</strong>.</li>
<li>The capital of the Hoysalas was initially located at <strong>Belur</strong> but was later moved to <strong>Halebidu</strong>.</li>
<li>Taking advantage of the warfare between the W<strong>estern Chalukya Empire and Kalachuris of Kalyani</strong>, the Hoysalas annexed the <strong>fertile areas north of the Kaveri delta</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>By the 13th century</strong>, they governed most of Karnataka, entire northwestern parts of Tamil Nadu and parts of western Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Importance of the Hoysala era:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It was an important period in the development of <strong>South Indian art, architecture, and religion</strong>.</li>
<li>The empire is remembered today primarily for <strong>Hoysala architecture</strong> – 100 surviving temples are scattered across Karnataka.</li>
<li><strong>Well-known temples</strong> – <em>Chennakeshava</em> Temple in Belur, <em>Hoysaleswara</em> Temple in Halebidu, <em>Chennakesava/Keshava</em> Temple in Somanathapura (Mysuru), etc., are known as <strong>an amazing displays of sculptural exuberance</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Architectural features of Hoysala temples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Most of the temples follow the <strong>ekakuta, dvikuta or trikuta pattern</strong> – temples with a single, double or three garbhagrihas or sanctum sanctorum.</li>
<li><strong>There are only two examples of Panchakuta shrines or temples</strong> – Keshava temple and the Panchalingeshwara temple (Mandya).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Reasons why Mandya’s temples are less popular among tourists:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Proximity to Mysuru</strong>, a popular tourist destination, has robbed the sheen off Mandya.</li>
<li>This is despite the fact that <strong>Mandya has 50</strong> State-protected and Centre-protected monuments against <strong>39</strong> in the Mysuru district.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Installing signboards</strong> giving cross-references to important monuments in the district in places where tourist footfalls are high.</li>
<li>With the popularity of these monuments, <strong>efforts to conserve the architectural marvels</strong> (most of which are nearly 1000 years old) should grow.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Bringing the lesser-known monuments to public light is important not only from a tourism perspective but to showcase a slice of history and heritage.</p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-3"><strong>GS Paper 3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Environmental Pollution and Degradation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/pollution/only-5-of-india-s-coal-based-thermal-power-capacity-meets-so2-emissions-norms-cse-report-90229"><strong>DTE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> One of the most polluting sectors of India – coal-based thermal power generation – was <strong>found to be brazenly flouting emission norms.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Emission norms in place:</strong> The MoEFCC made it <strong>mandatory</strong> (in 2015) for thermal power plants <strong>to install a flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) system</strong> to remove sulphur dioxide from their exhaust.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/spray.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/spray.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Status of implementation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Poor implementation</strong> of the sulphur dioxide emissions regulations.</li>
<li><strong>For example,</strong><ul>
<li>Only 5% of the country’s installed coal-based thermal power generation capacities had the FGD mechanism in place. (CSE)</li>
<li>17% of the overall coal power capacity was still at the very initial stages of compliance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Regional data on implementation status:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No plant in eastern India</strong> was found to be compliant with SO2 emissions norms.</li>
<li><strong>Maharashtra</strong> has the highest capacity to comply with the norms, followed by <strong>Gujarat, UP, Haryana and Tamil Nadu.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What do these results indicate?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The sector has been unwilling to comply</strong> with the central government regulations. Even new projects are not compliant with the SO2 emissions norms.</li>
<li><strong>This is despite the fact that the norms have been diluted</strong> for several parameters and deadlines delayed since they were issued.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reasons for the delayed implementation of the norms:</strong> The sector’s dependency on the external market for some FGD components, the novelty of the technology for the Indian market and the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of poor implementation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sulphur dioxide released in the open (without desulphurisation) causes <strong>pollution</strong>.</li>
<li>When sulphur dioxide combines with water and air, it forms <strong>sulfuric acid</strong>, which is the main component of <strong>acid rain</strong>.</li>
<li>Acid rain can cause <strong>deforestation, acidify waterways</strong> to the detriment of aquatic life, and be <strong>detrimental to human health</strong> (skin cancer).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges ahead: A total of 20 thermal plants are now being built</strong> with a combined capacity of <strong>27.4 GW</strong>, which will likely be included in the national capacity by the end of 2027–2028.</p>

<p><strong>A “Professor of Practice”</strong> is an individual with significant experience in a specific <strong>profession or industry</strong> who is appointed to a faculty position at a university.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional academic professors, they are often <strong>hired from outside academia</strong> and may not be required to have <strong>advanced research degrees</strong>. The role of a Professor of Practice is to bring <strong>real-world insights, practical knowledge, and industry perspectives</strong> into the classroom.</p>
<p>The concept has been institutionalized by the <strong>University Grants Commission (UGC)</strong> and aims to <strong>bridge the gap between academia and the professional world</strong>, fostering an entrepreneurial university environment.</p>

<p><strong>Why did Syama Prasad Mookerjee resign?</strong></p>
<p>He resigned from the Union cabinet (Minister for Industry and Supply) <strong>due to his disagreement with the controversial Nehru-Liaquat Pact</strong>, which he believed would leave <strong>Hindus in East Bengal at the mercy of the Pakistani stat</strong>e and go against his vision of a divided Bengal with West Bengal for Hindu Bengalis.</p>
<ul>
<li>He also opposed <strong>special status to Jammu and Kashmir</strong>. His famous slogan was “Ek desh mein do Vidhan, do Pradhan aur Do Nishan nahi chalenge” (trans: “<strong>One country cannot have two constitutions, two prime ministers and two flags”),</strong> referring to the provisions of Article 370.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong>  India’s Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act) is being <strong>updated as the Digital India Bill.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is Technology Facilitated Gender Based Violence (TFGBV)?</strong></p>
<p>Technology Facilitated Gender Based Violence (TFGBV) refers to the <strong>use of technology, such as the internet, social media platforms, or mobile devices</strong>, to perpetrate acts of violence, harassment, stalking, coercion, or abuse against individuals based on gender or sexual identity.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Existing social norms and the widening gender digital divide</strong> increase the vulnerability of groups already vulnerable to online violence.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Issues with the present legal framework:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>India’s present legal frameworks</strong> are not equipped to tackle internet-based harms.</li>
<li><strong>The Indian Penal Code, 1860</strong>, and the <strong>Criminal Procedure Code, 1973</strong>, were enacted to address physical harm, but they are <strong>also being applied in the online space</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>The Information Technology Act, 2000</strong>, was promulgated in the early days of the internet and as such <strong>unable to deal with the recent nature</strong>, forms and volume of online violence.</li>
<li>None of these laws specifically addresses <strong>the issue of gender violence</strong> in tech space.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The proposed Digital India Bill should incorporate sufficient safeguards against these types of crimes.</strong></p>

<h4 id="facts-for-prelims-ffp_5"><strong>Facts for Prelims (FFP)</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/what-is-the-chiral-bose-liquid-state/article66992947.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Recent research suggests that <strong>the chiral Bose-liquid state could be a completely new form of matter</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Typically, <strong>matter exists in solid, liquid, or gas states</strong>. However, at <strong>extremely low temperatures or within the quantum realm, matter behaves differently.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Quantum states of matter:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Quantum states of matter <strong>exhibit unique behaviours distinct from our familiar solid, liquid, and gaseous states.</strong></li>
<li>Frustrated quantum systems, in particular, involve the interactions of particles <strong>leading to infinite possibilities</strong>. In these systems, <strong>collisions can produce unexpected outcomes, such as levitating or defying traditional angles.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How it was formed:</strong></p>
<p>The chiral bose-liquid state is formed by <strong>bringing two layers of a special material very close together at very low temperatures (close to absolute Zero).</strong> One layer has an abundance of <strong>electrons</strong>, while the other layer has “<strong>holes</strong>” where electrons can go. When these layers are brought together, a local imbalance is created, causing <strong>electrons to not have enough holes to fill</strong>. This imbalance triggers the <strong>formation of the chiral bose-liquid state</strong>, which has unique properties and behaviours.</p>
<p>This unique state <strong>allows electrons to freeze into predictable patterns, exhibit resilience to changes in spin (a characteristic of subatomic particles), and synchronize their movements</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Why it is called ‘Chiral’?</strong></p>
<p>The term “<strong>chiral</strong>” refers to a property in physics where an object or system cannot be superimposed onto its mirror image. In the context of the chiral bose-liquid state, the term “chiral” is used because the electrons in the chiral bose-liquid state move or behave differently compared to their <strong>mirror-image counterparts</strong>, leading to unique and asymmetric characteristics.</p>
<p><strong>Application</strong>: The state could be useful for encryption technology in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Recently, many actresses have chosen to <strong>preserve their baby’s cord blood.</strong></p>
<p><strong>About Cord Blood:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cord blood is a <strong>rich source of stem cells</strong> that can potentially be used in the treatment of certain <strong>blood, immune, and metabolic disorders</strong>.</li>
<li>Private stem cell banking companies offer community or social banking options where <strong>stored cord blood is accessible to registered individuals</strong>.</li>
<li>These community banks have a <strong>larger pool of donors, increasing the chances of finding a match for patients in need</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The use of cord blood in transplants has <strong>declined in recent years</strong>, with <strong>haploidentical transplants</strong> (It uses healthy, blood-forming cells from a <strong>half-matched family member donor</strong> to replace the unhealthy ones) becoming more common and successful. While emerging technologies may improve the utilization of cord blood in the future, the <strong>present trend shows the under-utilization of stored cord blood.</strong></p>
