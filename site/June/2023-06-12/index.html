<p><strong>Context:</strong> The WHO report highlights the significant impact of the ‘Har Ghar Jal’ program on public health and economic savings.</p>
<p><strong>The focus of the report:</strong> The ‘Har Ghar Jal’ report focuses on <strong>diarrheal diseases</strong> as they contribute significantly to the <strong>overall disease burden related to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) issues.</strong></p>

<tr>
<td><strong>On Health impacts of the Har Ghar Jal program</strong></td>
<td>Ensuring safely managed drinking water <strong>for all</strong> could avert nearly <strong>400,000 deaths caused by diarrheal diseases</strong> and prevent approximately <strong>14 million Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs)</strong> related to these diseases.<br><br><strong><em>DALY</em>* is a measure that shows the </strong>impact of a disease or condition on a person’s health,** combining years lost due to premature death and years lived with a disability.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>On saving time and effort for women</strong></td>
<td>In 2018, households spent a staggering over 66 million hours each day collecting water, with the majority occurring in <strong>rural areas</strong></td>
<td>Tremendous <strong>time and effort have been saved</strong> for women and girls through the provision of tap water</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>On Safe water supply</strong></td>
<td>In 2018, <strong>36% of India’s total population, including 44%</strong> of the rural population, lacked access to improved drinking-water sources on their premises.</td>
<td>Unsafe drinking water, along with inadequate sanitation and hygiene, contributed to a number of deaths (esp. among children) and DALYs</td>

<p><strong>FPI regulation in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>FPIs are registered with <strong>SEBI</strong> and can invest in Indian securities as per the regulations prescribed by SEBI.</li>
<li><strong>The Foreign Exchange Management Act 1999</strong> (FEMA) is the primary legislation governing FPI in India and has been amended several times to liberalise FPI regulations in India.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are SEBI’s new proposals?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The proposed legislation <strong>categorises FPIs into low risk, moderate risk and high risk</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>The low risk</strong> would cover government and government-related entities such as central banks or sovereign wealth funds.</li>
<li><strong>Moderate risk</strong> refers to pension funds or public retail funds with widespread and dispersed investors.</li>
<li><strong>All other FPIs are categorised as high-risk.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Proposals for high-risk FPIs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Additional disclosure requirements</strong> for high-risk FPIs holding more than 50% of their equity asset under management (AUM) in a single corporate group.</li>
<li>The existing high-risk FPIs with an overall holding in the Indian equity market of over Rs 25,000 crore <strong>comply with the disclosure mandate within six months</strong>.<ul>
<li>Failing this, they would have to bring down their holding within the threshold.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exceptions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New FPIs</strong> that have just begun investments would be allowed to breach the threshold criteria for up to a period of six months.</li>
<li><strong>‘Moderate risk’ FPIs</strong>, whose India-oriented holdings are relatively small in comparison to their global portfolio, are not subjected to additional disclosure requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Need of the proposed regulations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Potential misuse</strong> of the FPI route for circumventing Press Note 3 stipulations (2020) that required an entity sharing a land border with India to involve in FPI only via the <strong>government route</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Concentrated group investments</strong> by FPIs to <strong>bypass</strong> regulatory requirements (such as that for minimum public shareholding).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance of the proposed regulations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>They would try to identify tangible ownership</strong> and curtail incidences of multiple routes.</li>
<li><strong>This would enhance transparency and help avert regulatory requirements</strong>, and keep up with the minimum (25%) public shareholding norms.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> According to a recent study published in the Nature Journal, the loss of Arctic Sea ice is expected to continue in the coming decades, even if carbon emissions are significantly reduced.</p>
<p><strong>What is Arctic Sea ice?</strong></p>
<p>Arctic sea ice refers to the frozen seawater that covers the Arctic Ocean and surrounding seas during the colder months. It spreads <strong>over one-sixth of the earth’s landmass</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Status:</strong></p>
<p>Data from the <strong>Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)</strong> indicate that the annual mean of <strong>Arctic Sea ice levels</strong> has been the <strong>lowest since at least 1850</strong>, while late summer levels have hit the lowest point in at least 1,000 years. The IPCC predicts that the <strong>Arctic will likely experience a practically ice-free September</strong> at least once before 2050.</p>
<p><strong>The new findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The world will see its first ‘sea-ice-free summer’</strong>before 2050 (corroborating IPCC findings), possibly in the 2030s.</li>
<li><strong>The global emissions</strong> will drive temperatures to <strong>beyond 4.5°C</strong> making the Arctic ice-free by 2081-2100.</li>
<li>There is <strong>no scenario under which the Arctic Sea ice</strong> can be saved in summer.</li>

<p><strong>What can India do?</strong></p>
<p>India should aim to understand the <strong>dynamics of Arctic demography and governance</strong>, going beyond scientific exploration. With its growing stature in world affairs, India can become the <strong>voice of Arctic tribes and raise their issues in global forums</strong>. By actively engaging in Arctic affairs, India can leverage this opportunity to shape policies and contribute to discussions concerning the region’s future. Previously <strong>India unveiled India’s Arctic Policy document.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>The focus should be on establishing a <strong>global ocean treaty that addresses the governance of the oceans worldwide</strong>, and prioritize safe and sustainable exploration of resources. This treaty should aim to ensure collaboration and cooperation among nations.</p>

<p><strong>The United Arab Emirates (UAE)</strong> is taking measures to restore and protect coral reefs that have been impacted by bleaching events and human activities. Efforts are being made to promote environmental projects, including the <strong>growth of artificial corals</strong> and the restoration of damaged corals by the diving community.</p>
<p>However, experts highlight that unless the underlying cause of coral reef degradation, such as overheating seas due to climate change, is addressed, restoration efforts may not be sustainable.</p>
