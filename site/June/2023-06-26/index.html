<h4 id="gs-paper-3"><strong>GS Paper 3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus: Agriculture and related issues</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/how-punjab-and-haryana-may-de-risk-indian-economy-in-bad-monsoon-season-8685949/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Assured irrigation access has made the two states (Punjab and Haryana) the most reliable producers of rice and wheat, which will matter in a bad monsoon year.</p>
<p><strong>Importance of Punjab and Haryana:</strong> Both have been <strong>India’s breadbasket and lynchpins of its food security,</strong> especially post the <strong>Green Revolution</strong> (the cultivation of high-yielding semi-dwarf varieties).</p>
<p><strong>The declining role of Punjab and Haryana:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Over the last two decades, the two states’ combined share in total <strong>wheat procurement</strong> for the Central foodgrain pool <strong>has fallen from 90% to 70%</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>It’s been from 44% to 28% for rice.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/all_water.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/all_water.jpg" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Reasons for this decline:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The diversification of procurement.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The state governments are also establishing infrastructure</strong> for the purchase of grain at <em>minimum support prices (MSP)</em> from farmers.</li>
<li><strong>For example,</strong><ul>
<li>In wheat, <strong>MP</strong> overtook Punjab as the top contributor to the Central pool in 2019-20.</li>
<li>In rice, <strong>Telangana</strong> has emerged as a clear No. 2 behind Punjab.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges to these scenarios:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bad/subnormal monsoon:</strong> The contribution of most states to wheat procurement has tended to be low in poor monsoon years due to low harvests (kharif crops).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/15/el-nino-and-monsoon/#:~:text=El%20Nino%20in%20India%3A&amp;text=Between%202001%20and%202020%2C%20India,3%25%2C%20leading%20to%20inflation."><strong>El Niño</strong></a> <strong>forecast this year</strong>: It has been associated with monsoon failures in India (2014, 2015 and 2018 recorded subnormal rainfall as all three were El Niño years).</li>
<li><strong>Temperature spikes due to global warming.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact of these challenges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rice production may be worst affected</strong>, as it is highly <strong>water-intensive</strong> and requires at least 25 irrigations in the absence of rain.</li>
<li><strong>Wheat (rabi crop) production may also suffer</strong>, due to temperature spikes and because it is grown using groundwater and dam reservoirs that are recharged/refilled during the monsoon.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The saviour states – Punjab and Haryana:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Farmers here have assured access to <strong>irrigation</strong>.</li>
<li>For example, Punjab has <strong>15 lakh electric tube wells</strong> and the state Punjab government is supplying <strong>8 hours of uninterrupted free power daily to run these tube wells</strong> during the paddy season.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Long-standing recommendations from policymakers and economists include weaning Punjab and Haryana farmers off of rice and reducing wheat acreage.</li>
<li>But today, with poor government stocks and soaring rice prices, these very states come to the rescue once again <strong>de-risking the Indian economy</strong>.</li>

<p>During Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the United States, one of the gifts he received was an <strong>autographed first-edition copy of the Collected Poems of Robert Frost</strong>, published in 1930.</p>
<p>Robert Frost, a renowned American poet, was the <strong>only writer to be awarded four Pulitzer Prizes</strong> and was highly regarded for his representation of quintessential American life. His poetry combined elements of <strong>romanticism and modernism</strong>, focusing on nature and the human condition.</p>
<p>Frost had a connection with India, as he was admired by <strong>India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru</strong>. Nehru particularly appreciated Frost’s poem <strong>“Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening”</strong> and reportedly kept a copy of Frost’s poems by his bedside, with the last stanza heavily underlined.</p>

<p>Efforts are underway to <strong>restore the Aravalli mountain range in India</strong>, which has been heavily impacted <strong>by illegal stone mining</strong>. Through a collaborative approach between the <strong>forest department, the local community and the police</strong>, steps have been taken to curb the mining activities and initiate rehabilitation. A reforestation project was undertaken, involving the planting of 10,000 native tree species (such as Sheesham, babool) across <strong>75 hectares</strong> of land. The restoration has attracted wildlife, including <strong>the nilgai antelope</strong>, which had been deterred by previous mining activities. Local residents were actively involved in the plantation and the area was also covered with <strong>moonj grass,</strong> providing livelihood options.</p>
<p><strong>Usage</strong>: Example can be quoted in Environment questions</p>
<p><strong>About Aravalli Range:</strong></p>
<p>The Aravalli Range is an <strong>Old Fold mountain range in Northern-Western India</strong>, running approximately <strong>670 km in a south-west direction</strong>, starting near Delhi, passing through southern Haryana, Rajasthan, and ending in <strong>Ahmedabad Gujarat</strong>. The highest peak is <strong>Guru Shikhar on Mount Abu</strong> at 1,722 m</p>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/business/india-us-decision-to-end-wto-disputes-to-help-boost-bilateral-trade-experts/article67000615.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> India and the United States have resolved to end their six trade disputes at the World Trade Organisation (WTO).</p>
<p><strong>The six disputes include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Those initiated by India</strong><ul>
<li>Countervailing measures on certain hot-rolled carbon steel flat products from India</li>
<li>Measures relating to the renewable energy sector</li>
<li>Certain measures on steel and aluminium products</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Those initiated by USA:</strong><ul>
<li>Certain measures relating to solar cells and modules</li>
<li>Export-related measures</li>
<li>Additional duties on some products from the US</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pending dispute:</strong> The one pending case is the poultry case where both India and the US remain involved in discussions to find a solution by the end of this year.</p>
<p><strong>Significance:</strong></p>
<p>The resolution of these disputes is viewed positively and is likely to contribute to the promotion of trade, enhance India’s exports to the US (In 2022-23 U.S. was the <strong>largest trading partner of India</strong>) and promotion of 2+2 dialogue between the two nations. The disputes cover various areas such as steel, aluminium, solar energy, and export-related measures.</p>
<p><strong>WTO Dispute Resolution Process:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>There are two main ways to settle a dispute once a complaint has been filed in WTO</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bilateral consultations</strong>: Parties find a mutually <strong>agreed solution, particularly during the phase of bilateral consultations</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Adjudication</strong>, including the subsequent implementation of the panel and Appellate Body, reports.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The WTO dispute settlement process involves three stages:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Consultations between the parties</li>
<li>Establishment of a dispute settlement panel if consultations fail</li>
<li>Adjudication by panels.</li>
</ol>
<p>The rulings or reports of the panels can be <strong>challenged by the WTO’s appellate body.</strong> However, the functioning of the <strong>appellate body is currently affected due to the USA blocking appointments to it</strong>. The final stage is the <strong>implementation of the ruling</strong>. As an alternative to the Appellate body, members have formed <strong>Multi-Party Interim Appeal Arbitration Arrangement (MPIA)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Recently, researchers at the <strong>Institute of Advanced Studies in Science and Technology</strong> explored <strong>the nutraceutical properties of Joha rice to investigate its potential benefits.</strong></p>
<p><strong>About Joha Rice:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Joha rice is an <strong>aromatic rice variety grown in northeastern India</strong>. Traditional claims suggest that Joha rice consumers have a <strong>lower risk of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The researchers discovered <strong>two essential fatty acids, linoleic acid (omega-6) and linolenic acid (omega-3),</strong> through laboratory analysis. These fatty acids, which the human body cannot produce, <strong>play a role in maintaining various physiological conditions</strong>.</li>
<li>Omega-3 fatty acid has been found to pr<strong>event metabolic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer.</strong> In diabetic rats, Joha rice was effective in <strong>reducing blood glucose levels and preventing the onset of diabetes.</strong></li>
<li>Additionally, the researchers found that <strong>scented Joha rice has a more balanced ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids</strong> compared to the commonly consumed non-scented variety.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Joha rice contains several antioxidants, flavonoids, and phenolics, which contribute to its beneficial effects.</strong> Some of the identified bioactive compounds in Joha rice include <strong>oryzanol, ferulic acid, tocotrienol, caffeic acid, catechuic acid, gallic acid, and tricin</strong>. These compounds have reported <strong>antioxidant, hypoglycaemic, and cardio-protective effects</strong>.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Astrophysicists are <strong>studying the origins and nature of fast radio bursts (FRBs),</strong> powerful radio frequency emissions from distant galaxies, <strong>which last only milliseconds.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Recent findings suggest that FRBs may be <strong>triggered by the collision of two neutron stars just before they merge.</strong> This collision <strong>releases gravitational waves and FRBs</strong>, which can be <strong>detected and studied</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are Fast radio bursts (FRBs)?</strong></p>
<p>Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are brief and intense bursts of radio waves originating from deep space. They are highly energetic and last for only a few milliseconds.</p>
<p><strong>Significance:</strong></p>
<p>The study sheds light on the in<strong>tense radio light observed in the host galaxies of some FRBs.</strong> These findings have implications for <strong>gravitational-wave astronomy</strong> and suggest that future radio telescopes, in combination with gravitational-wave observatories like the Square Kilometre Array and the upcoming <strong>Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA),</strong> <strong>could provide further insights into these high-energy cosmic events and the structure of the universe.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What are Radio waves and their significance in astronomy?</strong></p>
<p>Radio waves are a form of <strong>electromagnetic radiation</strong> with long wavelengths and low frequencies. In astronomy, radio waves play a significant role in studying celestial objects and phenomena. They allow astronomers to observe objects that are not visible in other wavelengths of light, such as galaxies, pulsars, quasars, and cosmic microwave background radiation.</p>
