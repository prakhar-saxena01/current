<h4 id="gs-paper-2"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Government policies and issues arising out of it</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/laying-the-foundation-for-a-future-ready-digital-india/article67012692.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The MeitY has been building consensus on the proposed Digital India Bill that will replace India’s 23-year-old IT Act 2000.</p>
<p><strong>The current regime in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The IT Act 2000 defines an “<strong>intermediary</strong>” to include any entity between a user and the Internet.</li>
<li><strong>The IT Rules sub-classify intermediaries</strong> into 3 main categories: Social Media Intermediaries (SMIs), Significant Social Media Intermediaries (SSMIs) and Online Gaming Intermediaries.<ul>
<li><strong>SMIs</strong> are platforms that facilitate communication and sharing of information between users.</li>
<li>SMIs that have a very large user base (above a specified threshold) are designated as <strong>SSMIs</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Issues with the current regime:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The definition of SMIs is very broad</strong> [encompassing a variety of services such as video communications, matrimonial websites, etc].</li>
<li><strong>The rules lay down stringent obligations</strong> for most intermediaries, such as a 72-hour timeline for responding to law enforcement ‘content take down’ requests.</li>
<li><strong>Unfortunately, all intermediaries</strong> [ISPs, websites, e-commerce platforms, cloud services] are treated similarly, which –<ul>
<li>Adds to their cost of doing business</li>
<li>Exposes them to greater liability without meaningfully reducing risks presented by the Internet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Global regime:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Only a handful of countries have taken a clear position on the issue of proportionate regulation of intermediaries.</li>
<li><strong>The EU’s Digital Services Act</strong> creates 3 tiers of intermediaries – hosting services, online platforms and very large online platforms, with increasing legal obligations.</li>
<li><strong>Australia</strong> has created an 8-fold classification system, with separate industry-drafted codes governing categories such as social media platforms and search engines.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Salient provisions of the Digital India Bill:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Classification of intermediaries:</strong> Such as social media platforms, e-commerce platforms, AI platforms, and fact-checking platforms, to prescribe specific rules to different types of intermediaries.<ul>
<li>It requires intermediaries to <strong>undertake risk assessments</strong> and uses that information to bucket them into relevant categories.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>New Regulator for the Internet:</strong> On the lines of the TRAI or the SEBI.</li>
<li><strong>Other provisions:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>The MeitY could classify</strong> deliberate misinformation, identity theft, cyberbullying of children, etc., as offences.</li>
<li>Some of the fundamental rules that presently apply to internet platforms, such as <strong>safe harbour norms, may also be changed.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Penal provisions for violations and user harms related to emerging technologies</strong>, including generative AI platforms like ChatGPT.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance of the Digital India Bill:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A comprehensive legal framework</strong> that will upgrade the current legal regime to tackle emerging challenges (user harm, competition, misinformation) in the digital space.</li>
<li><strong>It will redefine the contours</strong> of how technology is regulated, not just in India but also globally.</li>
<li><strong>For example</strong>, a granular, product-specific classification could improve accountability and safety online.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead for India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>As technology evolves</strong>, the specific categories may not work in the future. Therefore, <strong>an evolving classification framework</strong> is the need of the hour.</li>
<li><strong>Metrics for risk assessment and appropriate thresholds</strong> would have to be defined and reviewed on a periodic basis in consultation with the industry.</li>
<li><strong>The goal should also be to minimise obligations</strong> on intermediaries and ensure that regulations are proportionate to ability and size.</li>
<li><strong>Setting up in-house grievance appellate mechanisms</strong> with independent external stakeholders to increase confidence in the grievance process.</li>
<li><strong>Alternative approaches to curbing virality</strong>, such as circuit breakers to slow down content, could also be considered.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Deliberation on the <strong>Digital India Bill</strong> could help create a regulatory environment that helps achieve the government’s policy goal of creating a safer Internet ecosystem, while also allowing businesses to thrive.</p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-2_1"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Parliament and State Legislatures and Issues Arising out of their functioning</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/assam-delimitation-draft-what-changes-it-proposes-why-it-has-led-to-protests-8687267/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Election Commission of India (EC) released a draft delimitation document for Assam.</p>
<p><strong>What is delimitation?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is the act of <strong>redrawing the boundaries</strong> of an Assembly or Lok Sabha seat to reflect changes in population over time, based on the most current Census data<strong>.</strong></li>
<li>The process <strong>may alter the number of seats in a state</strong> so that the population of all seats is as <strong>uniform as possible across the state.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Legal/constitutional provisions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Article 82:</strong> Following each census, the allocation of Lok Sabha seats to the states, as well as the division of each state into territorial constituencies, shall be readjusted by such authority as <strong>Parliament may by law determine.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Section 8A of the Representation of the People Act, 1950:</strong> It allows for delimitation of Parliamentary and Assembly constituencies in Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur or Nagaland.</li>
<li><strong>Article 170</strong> (Composition of the Legislative Assemblies): Census figures (2001) shall be used for the purpose of readjustment of constituencies in the State.</li>
<li><strong>Reservation of seats</strong> for the SCs/STs will be provided as per Articles 330 (Lok Sabha) and 332 (State Assemblies) of the Constitution.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Delimitation Commission:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Article 82 of the Indian Constitution provides for the establishment of such a commission through a <strong>Parliamentary act.</strong></li>
<li>The orders of such a commission (have the force of law and cannot be challenged in court) will take into effect on a date to be determined by India’s <strong>President</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Need of delimitation in Assam:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Assam currently has <strong>14 Lok Sabha, 126 Assembly constituencies.</strong></li>
<li>The last delimitation of constituencies in Assam was done in 1976 on the basis of the <strong>1971 Census.</strong><ul>
<li>While the delimitation process was done in the rest of the country in 2008, <strong>it was deferred in Assam</strong> (and some other NE states) citing security concerns of the time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In 1971, Assam’s population was 1.46 crore, which increased to 2.66 crore (2001) and to 3.12 crore (2011).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Proposals of EC:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Following a 2020 notification from the Law Ministry, the EC in 2022 announced that it would initiate the exercise on the basis of census figures from 2001.</li>
<li><strong>While the number of seats is being retained</strong>, the EC has proposed not just changes in geographical boundaries, but also an increase in the number of reserved constituencies for STs and SCs.</li>
<li><strong>Districts with autonomous councils</strong> (administered under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution) get more seats.</li>
<li><strong>Change in nomenclature:</strong> Kaliabor Lok Sabha constituency now named ‘Kaziranga’</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why have these proposals run into controversy?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The state’s Bengali-origin Muslim community</strong> (often labelled as outsiders and non-indigenous to the state) alleged that the draft is partisan, depriving them politically.<ul>
<li>Constituencies have been shaped to <strong>mix minority areas with majority [Hindu] populations</strong>.</li>
<li>Several seats – with a significant Muslim population – <strong>have been done away with.</strong></li>
<li><strong>For example</strong>, as per the draft proposal, constituencies of the Barpeta district have now been reduced from 8 to 6 (one of them reserved for SC).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Constituencies of several sitting</strong> legislators and parliamentarians (across parties) may be impacted by virtue of changes.<ul>
<li><strong>For example</strong>, many Muslim-majority areas from the new Kaziranga constituency have been shifted to neighbouring Nagaon, which will affect the electoral fortunes of sitting MP.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Supporters of the proposals:</strong> Groups from the <strong>Bodo Territorial Council and Karbi Anglong district</strong> have hailed the proposal because it secures at least 102 constituencies for the “<strong>indigenous</strong>” people.</p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-3"><strong>GS Paper 3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus: Science and Technology</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/john-goodenough-a-nobel-prize-winning-co-creator-of-the-revolutionary-lithium-battery-dies-at-100/article67013177.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> John Goodenough, the <strong>Nobel Prize-winning co-creator of the lithium-ion battery</strong>, passed away at the <strong>age of 100</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Goodenough, Whittingham and Yoshino</strong> received Nobel Prize in 2019 for Chemistry. Each had unique breakthroughs that laid the foundation for developing a commercial rechargeable battery.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The 1970s: Whittingham:</strong> Whittingham’s work in the 1970s harnessed the tendency of lithium — the lightest metal — to give away its electrons to make a battery capable of generating just over two volts.</li>
<li><strong>The 1980s: Goodenough</strong> had built on Whittingham’s work and doubled the battery’s capacity to four volts by using cobalt oxide in the cathode, one of the two electrodes that make up the ends of a battery.</li>
<li><strong>The 1980s: Yoshino:</strong> That battery remained too <strong>explosive for general commercial use</strong>. Yoshino’s work in the 1980s <strong>eliminated the volatile pure lithium</strong> from the battery and instead opted for <strong>lithium ions that are safer</strong>. The first lightweight, safe, durable and rechargeable commercial batteries <strong>entered the market in 1991.</strong></li>
<li><strong>In 2017, Goodenough led a team of engineers to develop the first all-solid-state battery cells</strong> that could lead to safer, faster-charging, longer-lasting rechargeable batteries for handheld mobile devices, electric cars and stationary energy storage.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance</strong>: Li-ion batteries <strong>revolutionized technology by providing rechargeable power for various devices such as cellphones, computers, and electric cars</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Working Principle of Li-ion batteries:</strong></p>
<p>Lithium-ion batteries work based on the <strong>movement of lithium ions between two electrodes</strong>, the cathode (positive electrode) and the anode (negative electrode), through an electrolyte. When the battery is being charged, <strong>lithium ions move from the cathode to the anode</strong>, where they are stored. During discharge, the ions move back to the cathode, creating an electric current that can power devices.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>:</p>
<p>It’s important to note that <strong>solid-state batteries are still in the development and research phase</strong>, while lithium-ion batteries are widely used in various industries. Both Solid-state and lithium batteries hold great promise for the future and are a testament to John Goodenough’s work.</p>

<p><strong>With reference to ‘fuel cells’ in which hydrogen-rich fuel and oxygen are used to generate electricity, consider the following statements: (UPSC 2015)</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>If pure hydrogen is used as a fuel, the fuel cell emits heat and water as by-products.</li>
<li>Fuel cells can be used for powering buildings and not for small devices like laptop computers.</li>
<li>Fuel cells produce electricity in the form of Alternating Current (AC).</li>
</ol>
<p>Which of the statements given above is/are correct?</p>
<p>(a) 1 only</p>
<p>(b) 2 and 3 only</p>
<p>(c) 1 and 3 only</p>
<p>(d) 1, 2 and 3</p>
<p><strong>Answer: A</strong></p>
<p>A fuel cell uses the chemical energy of hydrogen or other fuels to cleanly and efficiently produce electricity (in the form of Direct Current). It can be used for powering the building as well as small devices (micro fuel cells). Fuel cells work like batteries, but they do not run down or need recharging.

<p>The current <strong>commitment of $100 billion represents a fraction of the amount</strong> required by the Global South to develop resilience against climate change (estimated to be $2 trillion annually by 2030 for developing countries (excluding China)).</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Instead of support from the developed nation, loans currently constitute the primary source of funds for climate financing. Therefore, financing support from developed countries must be fulfilled as soon as possible.</p>

<h4 id="content-for-mains-enrichment"><strong>Content for Mains Enrichment</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/wild-foods-contribute-to-womens-higher-dietary-diversity-in-india-says-study/article67011224.ece#:~:text=Results%20of%20the%20study%20revealed,did%20not%20collect%20wild%20foods."><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p>A study conducted by the Indian School of Business (ISB) has highlighted the significant contribution of <strong>wild foods to women’s dietary diversity</strong>, particularly in tribal areas of rural India.</p>
<p><strong>What are Wild Foods?</strong></p>
<p>Wild foods are food items that are gathered or harvested from natural environments such as forests, fields, or water bodies. These foods are <strong>not cultivated or cultivated with human intervention</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Examples of wild foods include <strong>berries like blackberries and raspberries, mushrooms like morels and chanterelles</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The research, published in the journal Nature Food, revealed that food items collected from forests and common lands play a crucial role in women’s diets, especially during the months of June and July when other crops are still growing. The findings shed light on the <strong>significance of wild foods for nutrition security, particularly in forest-dwelling communities</strong>, and highlight their role in stabilizing food consumption during climate shocks that impact rainfed crops.</p>
<p><strong>Usage</strong>: The study highlights the importance of public policies that promote indigenous knowledge of wild foods and protect people’s rights to access forests and common lands, as a means to improve nutrition. This example can be used in Indian Society, Social Justice, Environment and Anthropology papers.</p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-13"><strong>GS Paper 1/3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Important Geophysical Phenomena/ Disaster Management</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/flashfloods-landslides-meaning-explained-8686778/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Chandigarh-Manali highway was blocked following flash floods and landslides in parts of Haryana and Himachal Pradesh.</p>
<p><strong>What are flash floods?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Excessive or continuous rainfall</strong> over a period of days or during particular seasons, can lead to <strong>stagnation of water</strong> and cause flooding.</li>
<li><strong>Flash floods occur in a much shorter span of time</strong> (say, when rainfall creates flooding in less than 6 hours) and are <strong>highly localised</strong>.</li>
<li>Flash floods can also be caused by <strong>factors apart from rainfall</strong>, like when a dam overflows.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Causes of flash floods in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nearly 75% of the total rainfall is concentrated over just four months</strong> (June to September) → rivers witness a heavy discharge during these months.</li>
<li><strong>Cloudbursts or thunderstorms and overflowing glacial lakes</strong> (in Himalayan states formed due to the melting of glaciers).</li>
<li><strong>Depression and cyclonic storms</strong> in the coastal areas of Orissa, West Bengal, and Andhra Pradesh.</li>
<li><strong>Flash floods may begin to take place after wildfires</strong>. Wildfires destroy forests and other vegetation, which in turn weakens the soil and makes it less permeable for water to seep through.</li>
<li><strong>Climate change/global warming</strong> has increased the frequency/numbers of the above events<strong>.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What makes flash floods very dangerous?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>These are accompanied by <strong>landslides</strong>, which are sudden movements of rock, boulders, earth or debris down a slope.</li>
<li><strong>Landslides are common in mountainous terrains</strong>, where there are conditions created for them in terms of the soil, rock, geology and slope.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Vulnerability of India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>According to government data, <strong>India is the worst flood-affected country in the world</strong>, after Bangladesh.</li>
<li><strong>~40 million hectares of land</strong> in the country are liable to floods annually. (National Flood Commission)</li>
<li><strong>India accounts for one-fifth of the global death</strong> count due to floods.</li>
<li>Flash floods have been commonly witnessed in cities like <strong>Chennai and Mumbai</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steps taken:</strong> India has launched first-of-its-kind <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/10/25/india-launches-flash-flood-guidance-services-for-south-asia/"><strong>Flash Flood Guidance services</strong></a> for India and other South Asian countries – Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> A recent study conducted by researchers in Haryana, India, has identified an <strong>expanding area of active tectonic deformation</strong> in the northern plains of Haryana, south of the Himalayas.</p>
<p><strong>What is tectonic deformation?</strong></p>
<p>Tectonic deformation refers to the changes in the Earth’s crust caused by the movement and interaction of tectonic plates. It includes processes such as folding, faulting, and uplift, which shape the Earth’s surface and give rise to features like mountains, valleys, and earthquakes.</p>
<p><strong>Findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The study focused on the <strong>Piedmont zone</strong> (transition area between the mountains and the adjacent plains) <strong>between the Ghaggar and Yamuna river basins</strong> and found clear evidence of ongoing tectonic activity.</li>
<li>This active deformation has the potential to <strong>turn the Piedmont zone into a future seismic hazard area</strong>.</li>
<li>The research also suggests that this <strong>tectonic activity may have played a role in the extinction of the Vedic Saraswati River</strong> that once flowed through the region.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance of the finding</strong>:  The findings highlight the need for further investigations, including <strong>paleoseismic studies and SAR interferometry</strong>, to better understand the region’s stress distribution and strain accumulation.</p>
<p><strong>Fault lines in the Himalayas:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>HFF (Himalayan Frontal Fault):</strong> It is a major thrust fault at the front of the Himalayas, separating the Indian subcontinent from the Eurasian plate.</li>
<li><strong>MBT (Main Boundary Thrust):</strong> It is a significant fault in the Himalayas, marking the boundary between the Lesser Himalayas and the Sub-Himalayas.</li>
<li><strong>MCT (Main Central Thrust):</strong> This fault separates the Lesser Himalayas from the Greater Himalayas and is responsible for the uplift of the Greater Himalayas.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The article explores the concept of “greedflation” and discusses whether India is experiencing it.</p>
<p><strong>What is Greedflation?</strong></p>
<p>It refers to a situation where <strong>corporate greed fuels inflation</strong>. Instead of the <strong>traditional wage-price spiral,</strong> it is the <strong>profit-price spiral that drives inflation</strong>. In developed countries like Europe and the US, there is a growing consensus that <strong>greedflation is a significant factor contributing to inflation.</strong></p>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Essential Commodities during a Crisis</strong></td>
<td>In times of scarcity or crisis, certain essential commodities like food, water, or medical supplies may experience a surge in demand</td>
<td>Sellers of essential commodities increase prices excessively, exploiting consumers and contributing to higher inflation during crises.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Price Mark-ups and Profit Margins</strong></td>
<td>Companies may increase profit margins by keeping market prices high even when input costs decrease.</td>
<td>For example, if raw material costs decline, companies may maintain product prices without passing on savings to consumers. This allows companies to generate higher profits and contributes to inflationary pressures.</td>

</table>
<p><strong>India’s Case</strong>: In the context of India, the profitability of <strong>Indian companies has nearly tripled compared to the period before the pandemic</strong>. A significant growth in net profit, primarily driven by an <strong>increase in profit margins, indicates a possibility of corporate greed contributing to inflation in India.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Impact of Greedflation:</strong> It leads to higher inflationary pressures, financial strain on individuals, and reduced purchasing power. It undermines trust in businesses, distorts market dynamics, and hampers economic stability and growth.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Scientists from the <strong>Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA)</strong> have made progress in identifying the source of the <strong>Solar Mean Magnetic Field (SMMF),</strong> which influences <strong>interplanetary magnetic space and plays a significant role in space weather.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is Solar Mean Magnetic Field (SMMF</strong>)?</p>
<p><strong>The Solar Mean Magnetic Field (SMMF)</strong> refers to <strong>the average strength and direction</strong> of the magnetic field on the surface of the Sun.</p>
<p><strong>Findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The researchers found a strong similarity between the <strong>SMMF at chromospheric heights and the SMMF at photospheric heights,</strong> suggesting that the sun’s primordial magnetic field could be the <strong>source of the SMMF</strong>.</li>
<li>Understanding the source and driving parameters of the SMMF <strong>could enhance our understanding of how it affects the IMF and space weather.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Taiwan Strait holds significant importance for India, and India is well-positioned to lead a collaborative effort among Indo-Pacific states to ensure peace in this crucial sea route. <strong>The status of Taiwan</strong> remains the primary point of contention for China, which blames the <strong>US for hindering its goal of reunifying Taiwan</strong> with the mainland.</p>
<p><strong>The Taiwan Strait is a 180-kilometre-wide strait</strong> separating the island of Taiwan and continental Asia. The strait is part of the South China Sea and connects to the East China Sea to the north<strong>. The narrowest part is 130 km wide.</strong></p>

<p>According to a UN report, <strong>over 11 million people</strong> have been displaced in <strong>East Africa and the Great Lakes region (EHAGL)</strong> in 2023.</p>
<p><strong>Causes</strong>: The displacement is primarily caused <strong>by climate shocks such as floods and droughts, as well as conflicts and violence.</strong> Countries like Burundi, Ethiopia, Somalia, South Sudan, and Sudan have the highest numbers of internally displaced persons (IDPs).</p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-3_2"><strong>GS Paper 3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Govt budgeting (capital expenditure)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1935378"><strong>PIB</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Department of Expenditure, Ministry of Finance, has approved capital investment proposals of Rs. 56,415 crore in 16 States in the current financial year.</p>
<p><strong>Approval has been given under:</strong> The scheme entitled ‘Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment 2023-24’.</p>
<p><strong>What is capital expenditure (capex)?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It includes money spent by the government</strong> on the <strong>development/upgrading/repairing</strong> of physical assets (like health and education facilities), acquiring fixed and intangible assets, repayment of loans, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Capex of the government</strong> has been the prime driver in the economy (in recent years) because the private sector has not been in a position to invest due to poor demand and high inflation.</li>
<li>In FY23, the Centre’s capital expenditure exceeded the government’s revised estimate of <strong>Rs 7.28 lakh crore by Rs 8,551 crore</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance of capex:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Long-term in nature, leads to the creation of assets</strong> and allows the economy to generate revenue for many years.</li>
<li>Add or <strong>improve production facilities,</strong> increases labour participation, <strong>boost operational efficiency</strong> and raise the capacity of the economy to produce more in future.</li>
<li>Repayment of loan <strong>reduces liability</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Capex vs revenue expenditure:</strong> Revenue expenditure (salaries of employees, interest payment on past debt, subsidies, pension, etc) is <strong>recurring</strong> in nature and neither creates assets nor reduces any liability of the government.</p>
<p><strong>Concerns:</strong> Conflict between capex and public spending. <strong>For example</strong>, when capex was 14.2% of Budget Estimates in the FY 2019-20, the government had to cut public spending sharply in order to meet its deficit target.</p>
