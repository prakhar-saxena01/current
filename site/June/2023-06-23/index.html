<ul>
<li>The Governor’s recent actions, <strong>including returning the joining report of SEC Rajiva Sinha</strong>, have triggered a <strong>constitutional crisis</strong>.</li>
<li>Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee <strong>ruled out the possibility of removing the SEC</strong> and emphasized the peaceful nature of the elections.</li>
<li>Last year, then-<strong>governor Jagdeep Dhankhar was accused of delaying bills</strong> and interfering in matters of administration by the West Bengal Government.</li>

<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Issues Relating to Development and Management of Social Sector</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/india-climbs-eight-places-to-127-in-global-gender-index-says-wef-report/articleshow/101162655.cms"><strong>ET</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> According to the annual Gender Gap Report 2023 (17th edition) of the <strong>World Economic Forum (WEF)</strong>, India was ranked <strong>127 out of 146 countries</strong> in terms of gender parity – an improvement of 8 places from last year.</p>
<p><strong>The Global Gender Gap Report:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/economic_.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/economic_.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>It is an annual index first published in <strong>2006</strong> by the WEF <strong>to measure gender equality.</strong></li>
<li><strong>It assesses countries</strong> on how well they are dividing their resources and opportunities among their male and female populations, regardless of the overall levels of these resources and opportunities.</li>
<li>It serves as a <strong>catalyst</strong> for greater awareness as well as greater exchange between policymakers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Highlights of the 2023 report:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rank_country.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rank_country.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No country</strong> has yet achieved full gender parity.</li>
<li>For the 14th consecutive year, <strong>Iceland (91.2%)</strong> takes the top position. It also continues to be the <strong>only country</strong> to have closed more than 90% of its gender gap.</li>
<li><strong>Gender parity in Europe (76.3%)</strong> surpasses the parity level in North America (75%) this year to rank first of eight geographic regions.</li>
<li><strong>Sub-Saharan Africa</strong> ranks 6th (68.2%), slightly below the global weighted average score (68.3%).</li>
<li><strong>Southern Asia (63.4%)</strong> overtakes the <strong>Middle East and North Africa (62.6%)</strong> – the region furthest away from parity in 2023.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Major challenge:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The state of gender parity in the labour market</strong> remains a major challenge.</li>
<li>Not only has <strong>women’s participation</strong> in the labour market globally slipped, but other <strong>markers of economic opportunity</strong> have been showing substantive disparities between women and men.</li>
<li><strong>For example,</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Labour markets of the future:</strong> Women remain significantly underrepresented (29.2%) in the <strong>STEM workforce</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Skills of the future:</strong> Women do not have equal opportunities and access to <strong>online learning platforms</strong>, given the persistent <strong>digital divide.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Performance of India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The country had improved</strong> by 1.4 percentage points and 8 positions since the last edition and had <strong>closed 64.3% of the overall gender gap</strong>.</li>
<li>The country had attained <strong>parity in enrolment</strong> across all levels of education.</li>
<li><strong>On political empowerment</strong>, India has registered 25.3% parity, with women representing 15.1% of parliamentarians – the highest for the country since the inaugural report in 2006.<ul>
<li>This comes after the WEF recognised the need to enumerate women’s <strong>participation in local government bodies</strong> in its Gender Gap Report after the Indian government raised the issue.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Performance of India’s neighbours:</strong> Pakistan at 142, Bangladesh at 59, China at 107, Nepal at 116, Sri Lanka at 115 and Bhutan at 103.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges for India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>India had reached only 36.7% parity in <strong>economic participation and opportunity.</strong></li>
<li>While there had been an uptick in parity in wages and income, <strong>the share of women in senior positions and technical roles had dropped</strong> slightly since the last edition.</li>
<li>The relatively low overall rankings on the Health and Survival sub-index are explained by <strong>skewed sex ratios at birth.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Implementing a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) programme</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Increasing women’s economic participation and achieving gender parity in leadership</strong> (both business and government).</li>
<li><strong>Collective, coordinated and bold action</strong> by private and public sector leaders will be instrumental in accelerating progress towards gender parity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>The gender parity globally has recovered to pre-Covid levels but the pace of change has stagnated as converging crises slow progress.</p>

<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Effect of Policies and Politics of Developed and Developing Countries on India’s Interests</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/who-pays-for-the-clean-up-eus-carbon-border-adjustment-mechanism-flies-in-face-of-wto-regulations-8678439/lite/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The industrialised countries have not walked the talk of financing the climate mitigation and adaptation efforts of the poorer countries.</p>
<p><strong>Why does the burden lie on industrialised countries? Historical responsibility</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A bulk of the accumulated GHGs, the reason for global warming, <strong>have come from a group of about 40 rich and industrialised countries</strong>, usually referred to as <strong>Annex I countries</strong> in the 1992 UNFCCC.</li>
<li>The contribution of the poorer countries (the <strong>Global South</strong>) was negligible.</li>
<li>Additionally, countries in the Global South were already <strong>struggling to pay their external debt</strong>, exacerbated by the pandemic.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mechanisms that made industrialised countries liable:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Kyoto Protocol</strong> (1997) recognised the “common but differentiated responsibilities” in the fight against climate change.</li>
<li><strong>The Paris Agreement</strong> (2015) asked countries <strong>to set voluntary emission targets</strong> but required the richer countries to make financial transfers to the developing economies.<ul>
<li>It set a floor of <strong>$100 billion per year</strong> (that the developed countries had committed to raising from 2020) for these transfers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Concerns:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In the definition of climate finance, <strong>commercial loans should not be counted.</strong></li>
<li>In 2020, <strong>$83 billion was paid into the climate finance</strong> fund to be transferred to the countries of the Global South.</li>
<li>Out of this, <strong>less than $25 billion was in the form of grants</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recent efforts to boost climate finance:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/21/new-global-financing-pact/"><strong>New Global Financing Pact</strong></a></li>
<li>The EU has put forward a proposal, called the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/09/eus-carbon-border-tax-2/"><strong>Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)</strong></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CBAM:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This involves <strong>imposing tariffs</strong> on imports from other countries that are seen to be using carbon-intensive methods of production.</li>
<li>This mechanism, starting in <strong>2026</strong>, will cover products such as cement, steel, aluminium, oil refinery, paper, glass, chemicals and electricity generation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The CBAM is expected to achieve three objectives</strong>: Reduce the EU’s emissions, for the EU not lose competitiveness in carbon-intensive goods and to make the targeted countries reduce the carbon intensity of their exports.</p>
<p><strong>Issues with CBAM:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The CBAM is a unilateral move</strong>, against the spirit of <strong>multilateralism</strong>.</li>
<li>It could be used for <strong>protectionism</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Equity considerations</strong>, are designed to help rich countries avoid paying for creating the climate problem.</li>
<li>It targets <strong>production processes</strong> (not the product itself) that the WTO does not approve of.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How will it affect the Global South?</strong> This mechanism seeks to penalise <strong>“free riders”</strong> – one who is not contributing, although has the means to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Most affected:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Only 3 of the 12 exporters to the EU have a mechanism for “pricing carbon”.</li>
<li>The countries most affected will be <strong>Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, India and China</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A global price for carbon to redress the global “externality”.</strong></li>
<li>Clarity on the following before CBAM is implemented:<ul>
<li><strong>First, which countries will be exempt?</strong> These are likely to be those that possibly have a national emissions cap or a sectoral cap or are the poorest countries.</li>
<li><strong>Second, which emissions are included in the levying of the import tax?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Finally, which products are to be included?</strong> Possibly, a narrow coverage with high trade and carbon exposure.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>About the CSE report:</strong> The report highlights <strong>how various stakeholders procure, process and sell</strong> organic and natural produce while trying to ensure remunerative prices to farmers.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges faced by farmers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of market access</strong> → unable to sell their produce at a remunerative price.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of certification</strong> → detrimental to demands (domestic and exports) → becoming a barrier in India’s journey towards non-chemical farming practices.</li>
<li>Organic farmers don’t get all the benefits conventional farmers get in terms of <strong>subsidies</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Working with consumers for <strong>behavioural change</strong> towards organic produce (as in the case of millet).</li>
<li><strong>Coherence in the different certification systems</strong> like Participatory Guarantee System (PGS) and third-party National Programme for Organic Production (NPOP) certification.</li>
<li><strong>Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs)</strong> need government support for working capital, dedicated infrastructure and support for capacity building.</li>
<li><strong>Expand value addition and move towards shorter supply chains</strong> for better price realisation by farmers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Some best practices from Himachal Pradesh:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prakritak Kheti Khushhal Kisan Yojana:</strong> To increase agricultural income by adopting <strong>ZBNF</strong>. The system will not only improve soil fertility but also discourage the use of fertilisers and pesticides and reduce environmental pollution.</li>
<li><strong>Subsidy:</strong> To promote organic farming in the state, the state government is providing a 50% subsidy to farmers for setting up vermicompost units.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion: Unless farmers get assured access to the market</strong> to sell their produce at a remunerative price, the challenge of transition will remain difficult to overcome.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong>  Prime Minister Narendra Modi gifted a <strong>7.5-carat lab-grown diamond</strong> to U.S. First Lady Jill Biden during his state visit. The diamond was manufactured in a <strong>Surat factory in Gujarat</strong>, using a process that replicates the formation of natural diamonds beneath the earth’s surface.</p>
<p><strong>More about the LGD:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>India is a leading player in growing lab-grown diamonds</strong>, with exports reaching over <strong>$1.67 billion</strong>.</li>
<li>Lab-grown diamonds offer a more affordable alternative to natural diamonds and are considered eco-friendly.</li>
<li>They are around <strong>20% cheaper than their naturally-formed equivalent</strong></li>
<li>India is the largest producer of lab-grown diamonds through <strong>CVD technology</strong> and contributes to nearly <strong>25% of global LGD production through CVD technology</strong>.</li>
<li>But overall, India accounts for <strong>15% of the global production of LGD</strong> </li>

<tr>
<td><strong>Membrane Processes</strong></td>
<td>Membrane processes involve the use of <strong>selectively permeable membranes</strong> to separate contaminants from water or wastewater. In the case of textile effluent treatment, the membrane is <strong>modified to decrease pore size and enhance performance</strong>. It effectively separates pollutants, resulting in cleaner water.</td>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The government has amended the Electricity (Rights of Consumers) Rules 2020 to empower power consumers, ensure a 24X7 reliable electricity supply at affordable cost, etc.</p>
<p><strong>The Electricity (Rights of Consumers) Rules 2020:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Ministry of Power has promulgated the Rules under <strong>the Electricity Act, 2003</strong>.</li>
<li>These rules shall <strong>empower the consumers of electricity</strong> as the consumers have the right to get <strong>reliable services and quality electricity</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rights and obligations under the Rules:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is the <strong>duty of every distribution licensee</strong> to supply electricity on request made by an owner or occupier of any premises in line with the provisions of the Act.</li>
<li>It is the <strong>right of consumers</strong> to have minimum standards of service for the supply of electricity from the distribution licensee.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The changes made in the Rules:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction of <strong>Time of Day (ToD) Tariff</strong>, and</li>
<li>Rationalisation of smart metering provisions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Introduction of Time of Day (ToD) Tariff:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Rather than being charged for electricity at the same rate at all times of the day, <strong>there will be separate tariffs for peak hours, solar hours and normal hours.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tariffs during solar hours</strong> (8 hours in a day as specified by the State Electricity Regulatory Commission) shall be 10%-20% less than the normal tariff.</li>
<li><strong>Tariffs during peak hours</strong> will be 10 to 20% higher.</li>
<li>It shall be made effective immediately after the <strong>installation of smart metres</strong>, for the consumers without smart metres.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Applicable for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Commercial and Industrial consumers</strong> have Maximum demand of 10 KW and above, from 1st April 2024 and</li>
<li><strong>For all other consumers except agricultural consumers</strong>, latest from 1st April 2025.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The ToD is <strong>a win-win</strong> for consumers as well as the power system.</li>
<li><strong>For consumers:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>The separate tariffs will send price signals to consumers</strong> to manage their load according to the Tariff.</li>
<li>With awareness and effective utilisation of the ToD tariff mechanism, <strong>consumers can reduce their electricity bills</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>For the power system:</strong> The ToD mechanism will also ensure <strong>better grid integration</strong> of Renewable Energy sources thereby facilitating <strong>faster energy transition</strong> for India.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Current status of ToD mechanism:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In India:</strong> Most of the State Electricity Regulatory Commissions (SERCs) have <strong>already implemented ToD tariffs for the large Commercial and Industrial category of consumers</strong>.<ul>
<li>Various statutory provisions already exist to enable and promote the implementation of ToD tariffs (i.e. Tariff Policy 2016, Electricity Act 2003 and National Electricity Policy 2005).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Globally:</strong> It is recognised across electricity industries, as an important <strong>Demand Side Management (DSM)</strong> measure to reduce the demand during peak periods.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Amendment in smart metering provision:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The government has <strong>simplified the rules for smart metering</strong>.</li>
<li>To avoid inconvenience/harassment of the consumers, <strong>the existing penalties for an increase in consumer demand beyond the maximum sanctioned load/demand have been reduced.</strong></li>
<li>Post installation of a smart metre, <strong>no penal charges will be imposed on a consumer</strong> based on the maximum demand recorded by the smart metre for the period before the installation date.</li>
