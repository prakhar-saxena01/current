<p><strong>Context:</strong> The article discusses the impact of cyclones on the onset of the monsoon season and how global warming is affecting this relationship.</p>
<p><strong>What are Tropical Cyclones?</strong></p>
<p>Tropical cyclones are powerful storms that form <strong>over warm ocean waters</strong> near the equator. They are characterized by <strong>strong winds, heavy rainfall, and a well-defined centre</strong> called the eye.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tropical_cyclone_2.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tropical_cyclone_2.jpg" /></a></strong></p>

<p><strong>The ‘Onset of the Monsoon’:</strong></p>
<p><strong>The onset of the monsoon over the Kerala coast</strong> marks the beginning of the southwest monsoon season in India, which lasts from June to September and provides <strong>more than 70% of the country’s annual rainfall.</strong></p>
<p><strong>IMD criteria for the onset of the monsoon:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rainfall</strong>: The onset is declared if <strong>at least 60% of 14 designated</strong> meteorological stations in Kerala and Lakshadweep record at least <strong>2.</strong><strong>5 mm</strong> of rain for <strong>two consecutive days</strong> at any time after May 10.</li>
<li><strong>Wind field:</strong> The IMD says that the <strong>depth of westerlies should be up to 600 hectopascal</strong> (1 hPa is equal to 1 millibar of pressure) in the area that is bound by the equator to 10ºN latitude, and from longitude 55ºE to 80ºE.</li>
<li><strong>Heat</strong>: The INSAT-derived Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) value should be below <strong>200 watts per sq m (wm2)</strong> in the area between the <strong>5ºN and 10ºN latitudes</strong>, and 70ºE and 75ºE longitudes.<ul>
<li><strong>The outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) value</strong> is a measure of the energy emitted to space by the Earth’s surface, oceans, and atmosphere.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact of early or late monsoon on the volume of rainfall?</strong></p>
<p>The northward progression of the monsoon depends on various factors and can vary regionally. Consequently, early onset or late onset does not impact the volume of monsoon rain, as the timing of the <strong>onset does not directly correlate</strong> with the overall quality or amount of rainfall.</p>
<p><strong>What is Atmospheric Bridge?</strong></p>
<p>It is a <strong>connection in the Earth’s atmosphere</strong> that allows the exchange of air and weather elements between distant regions.</p>
<ul>
<li>g., The <strong>connection between the Arctic region and the Indian subcontinent</strong> through the atmosphere can influence the Indian monsoon by affecting wind patterns and moisture transport, potentially impacting the timing and intensity of the monsoon rains.</li>
<li>Another example of an atmospheric bridge is the phenomenon known as the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pineapple_Express">Pineapple Express</a>” in the USA</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is Oceanic Tunnel?</strong> </p>
<p>It refers to a connection or pathway between two distant regions in the <strong>Ocean</strong> that allows the exchange of water, heat, and other oceanic properties.</p>
<ul>
<li>g., The oceanic tunnel and atmospheric bridge from the Southern Ocean (Antarctic Ocean) can affect the <strong>moisture availability, wind patterns, and climate conditions</strong> in the Indian Ocean region</li>
<li>Another example of an Oceanic tunnel is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Stream">the <strong>Gulf Stream</strong></a>. It acts as an oceanic tunnel, <strong>transporting warm water from the tropics to higher latitudes,</strong> affecting the climate and weather patterns in those regions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> </p>
<p>Cyclones play a <strong>crucial role in influencing the monsoon’s onset</strong>, with their position and wind circulation around them impacting the transition of the <strong>monsoon trough</strong>. Climate change introduces new uncertainties, challenging the <strong>predictability of the monsoon’s</strong> behaviour. However, <strong>a late monsoon onset</strong> does not necessarily <strong>imply a deficit</strong>, and India <strong>remain watchful</strong> and <strong>hopeful</strong> for the arrival of the monsoon.</p>

<p><strong>Note: The article is in continuation to yesterday’s article</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/09/usas-indo-pacific-strategy/"><strong>USA’s Indo-Pacific Strategy</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> As the Indian PM prepares for his official state visit to Washington DC, India and the US are considering building their relationship in light of a greater alignment in Asia and the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p><strong>Need for greater alignment in Asia and the Indo-Pacific:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rise in China’s assertiveness:</strong><ul>
<li>China has been <strong>grabbing disputed territories</strong> from its neighbours.</li>
<li>However, <strong>there is a reluctance in the region</strong> to jeopardise the deep economic relationship with Beijing and <strong>avoid politically offending China</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>US-China conflict:</strong> The 20th edition of the <strong>annual Shangri-La Dialogue (SLD) in Singapore</strong> highlighted the deepening tensions between the US and China.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>USA’s Indo-Pacific strategy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Despite the continuing crises in the Middle East and a major war in Europe, Washington has repeatedly reaffirmed that the <strong>Indo-Pacific remains the highest priority.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Removing the Asian fear</strong> by explicitly challenging China’s claim to regional hegemony has been at the core of the <strong>US Indo-Pacific strategy.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>USA approach towards China:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>National actions include <strong>measures for control of technology exports to China</strong> and growing military support for Taiwan.</li>
<li>The US is <strong>mobilising a broad-based coalition</strong> to balance China. <strong>For example,</strong> it has drawn (the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada) into the grand regional coalition.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Change in USA’s approach:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>However, at the G7 meeting in Hiroshima, the US President appeared to suggest a <strong>change of approach by using the word “de-risk”</strong> for their economic engagement with China instead of the more combative “decouple”.</li>
<li>The US is also <strong>resuming high-level talks</strong> on confidence-building measures to prevent the tensions from escalating.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why a change in USA’s approach?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Economic engagement</strong> forms a substantial part of the US-China relationship.</li>
<li><strong>Bilateral trade</strong> was almost $700 billion in 2022. The US imports more from China than any other country.</li>
<li><strong>American companies</strong> have long seen China as a top investment destination.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>China’s suspicion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>China is unwilling to accept the US terms of engagement and sees USA’s persistent call for high-level dialogue as a <strong>trap</strong>.</li>
<li>China criticises the resurgent “<strong>cold war mentality</strong>” and demands that “<strong>mutual respect should prevail over bullying and hegemony</strong>”.</li>
<li>It sees the <strong>Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad)</strong> as a mechanism to contain it in the Indo-Pacific.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The current state of US-China relations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A Cold War-style détente emerged between today’s two superpowers.</strong></li>
<li>The détente reduced tensions and led to a period of cooperation (between the then superpowers – the US and USSR), even as proxy conflicts played out in their respective spheres of influence.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Where do other Asian countries stand?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Many Asian nations have <strong>stepped up political and military engagement</strong> [trilateral coordination with Seoul and Tokyo, <strong>a local quad</strong> (Australia, Japan, Philippines)] with the US despite Chinese warnings.</li>
<li><strong>Japan:</strong> The US has been encouraging Japan too –<ul>
<li>Raise its military capabilities,</li>
<li>Modernising the military alliance with South Korea,</li>
<li>Revitalising military partnership with Manila and</li>
<li>Enhancing security cooperation with Indonesia.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>India:</strong><ul>
<li>The US and India have come closer over <strong>a shared perception of China’s rise</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>India’s embrace of Quad and the US Indo-Pacific strategy</strong> came after the <strong>Doklam</strong> standoff in 2018 and the <strong>PLA’s incursions</strong> into eastern Ladakh in 2020.</li>
<li>The shared interests in <strong>stabilising the Asian balance of power</strong> are objective realities demanding a solid India-US <strong>strategic partnership</strong>.</li>
<li>Currently, both are in talks for a <strong>significant elevation of bilateral defence cooperation</strong>, including technology transfers and joint defence industrial production.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How would an improvement in US-China relations play out for India?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It would be “<strong>counterproductive</strong>” to India’s interests.</li>
<li>India’s worst nightmare in the years to come would be <strong>the emergence of a US-China G2</strong> for global stability.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The USA’s recent approach towards China is seen as an attempt to build a ‘<strong>New Asia</strong>’, where two superpowers (US and China) indirectly accept each other’s spheres of influence.</li>
<li>India requires a <strong>counterbalancing</strong> strategy against China that involves cooperating with the US and others with similar interests, while also maintaining <strong>strategic autonomy and national interests.</strong></li>

<td><strong>MSP</strong></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Meaning</strong></td>
<td>It is a policy decision (not enforceable by law), that ensures market intervention by the Government of India <strong>to insure agricultural producers against any sharp fall in farm prices</strong>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Announced by</strong></td>
<td>The <strong>Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs</strong> (chaired by the PM) on the basis of the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (<strong>CACP</strong>) at the beginning of the sowing season for certain crops.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Background</strong></td>
<td>The MSP regime came into existence as a policy decision in <strong>1967</strong> [on the recommendations of the Food Grain Price Committee (constituted in 1964 under LK Jha)] and the government set up the Agricultural Prices Commission (renamed as the CACP in 1985) for fixing MSP for crops.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Objectives</strong></td>
<td>A guaranteed price/safety net to prevent the farmers from distress sales and to procure food grains for public distribution.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Crops covered</strong></td>
<td><strong>7 types of cereals</strong> (paddy, wheat, maize, bajra, jowar, ragi and barley), <strong>5 types of pulses</strong> (chana, arhar/tur, urad, moong and masur), <strong>7 oilseeds</strong> (rapeseed-mustard, groundnut, soybean, sunflower, sesamum, safflower, nigerseed) and <strong>4 commercial crops</strong> (cotton, sugarcane [FRP], copra, raw jute)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>How is it calculated?</strong></td>
<td>The CACP considers both <strong>‘A2+FL’ and ‘C2’</strong> costs while recommending MSP.<br><br><strong>A2</strong> costs cover all paid-out expenses, incurred by farmers on seeds, fertilisers, etc.<br><br><strong>A2+FL</strong> covers actual paid-out costs plus an imputed value of unpaid family labour.<br><br><strong>The C2</strong> costs account for the rentals and interest forgone on owned land and fixed capital assets respectively, on top of A2+FL.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Concerns</strong></td>
<td><strong>Not all crops benefit from MSPs:</strong> While around 45% of the paddy produced is procured at MSP, it is about <strong>25% in the case of cotton and only 1-3% in</strong> the case of pulses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Procurement is concentrated in only a few states:</strong> <strong>For example</strong>, Punjab, Haryana, western UP, Chhattisgarh and Telangana for paddy; Telangana and Maharashtra for cotton, etc.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>The majority of farmers remain uncovered:</strong> According to an NSSO, <strong>~6% of Indian farmers</strong> have benefited directly from selling their wheat or rice under the MSP regime.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Low MSP:</strong> For example, Maharashtra expects a 10% fall in cotton acreage in the upcoming kharif season. This is mainly because of the low MSP for cotton when compared with pulses (like tur) and soybean.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Executing the recommendations of the MS Swaminathan Commission half-heartedly:</strong> It recommended that MSP should be at least 50% more than the weighted average cost of production.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>

</table>
<p><strong>The announcement:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The government announced that MSPs for the Kharif season will <strong>go up by an average of 7%.</strong></li>
<li><strong>This is the highest MSP increase</strong> in the last 5 years and the second highest in the last decade.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The economic and political significance of MSP announcements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The economic aspect of MSPs is not limited to farmers alone.</strong> While a sharp rise in MSPs does alleviate farm distress, <strong>it can also lead to a spike in food inflation.</strong><ul>
<li>Hence, there is a <strong>trade-off between the interests of the farmer and consumers.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Closer to elections</strong>, it is natural for governments to announce high MSPs to win over the farmer’s vote.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>El Nino:</strong> Though the MSP hike is unlikely to spike inflation by itself, food inflation may still spike if the normal monsoon is affected by El Nino. This may be a cause of worry for the <strong>Monetary Policy Committee.</strong></li>
<li><strong>For the government’s finances:</strong> Higher MSPs and more procurement as well as the storage and disbursal of subsidised food grains are all expenses that <strong>harm the financial health of the government.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The impact of the MSP hike on the rural economy will be uneven:</strong> This is because the rural economy is lagging behind urban India (in consumption growth).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About CACP:</strong></p>
<p>It is an <strong>attached office of the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare</strong>. The Agricultural Prices Commission (APC) was set up in <strong>1965</strong> to advise the Government on the price policy of major agricultural commodities. Since March 1985, the Commission has been known as CACP.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The <strong>European Union’s (EU) executive arm proposed</strong> to create an <strong>ethics body that</strong> would set up <strong>common rules of conduct for institutions</strong> after the cash<strong>-for-influence scandal.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>With the establishment of the Ethics Body there will, for the first time<strong>, be common standards for the ethical conduct of members and a formal mechanism for coordination and exchange of views on ethical requirements among institutions</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The new Body will have three main tasks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Develop common minimum standards</strong>– applicable to the <strong>members of participating EU Institutions</strong> <strong>and bodies</strong>, as well as update them when needed.</li>
<li><strong>Exchange of views on each institution’s internal rules in light of the standards</strong> to allow them to learn and benefit from each other’s experience.</li>
<li><strong>Promote a common ethics culture of all members of EU institutions</strong>, facilitating the public understanding of the framework both to those inside and outside the institutions. Transparency will apply also to the application of these rules in the institutions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The standards will relate to several fields:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>acceptance of gifts, hospitality and travel offered by third parties</strong></li>
<li><strong>conditionality and transparency measures</strong>, in particular for meetings with interest representatives: the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council already have <strong>common standards as regards meetings with interest representatives and their publication thanks to the Transparency Register</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>interests and assets to be declared, establishing the categories</strong>, as well as the procedures applied to check these declarations.</li>
<li><strong>side or external activities, in order to ensure that members’ availability and independence</strong> are not compromised.</li>
<li><strong>post-mandate activities of former members</strong>, establishing conditions, and transparency requirements.</li>
<li><strong>implementation of the common framework, including monitoring compliance and follow-up,</strong> also as regards possible cases of harassment and sanctions, in case of breaches within each institution.</li>
<li>on the <strong>publicity of information</strong>: each institution will need to make public how they apply the standards.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other measures taken with respect to Ethical Standards:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Code of Conduct for the Members of the European Commission</li>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) is all set to host an <strong>international conference to develop an ethical framework</strong> for the <strong>usage of neurotech devices</strong> that feed brain-<strong>wave data to computers through dry electrodes and implants.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It will be guided by a report by <strong>UNESCO’s International Bioethics Committee</strong> on the <strong>“Ethical Issues of Neurotechnology.”</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Neurotechnology could help solve many health issues, but it could also access and manipulate people’s brains, and produce information about our identities, and our emotions. It could threaten our <strong>rights to human dignity, freedom of thought and privacy,</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Neurotechnology covers any <strong>kind of device or procedure which is designed to “access, monitor, investigate, assess, manipulate, and/or emulate the structure and function of neural systems”</strong>.</li>
<li>Neurotechnological devices <strong>range from “wearables</strong>”, to non-invasive brain-computer interfaces such as robotic limbs, to brain implants currently being developed with the goal of treating disabilities such as paralysis.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Odisha Chief Minister <strong>Naveen Patnaik has removed Rohit Pujari</strong> from the position of <strong>Higher Education Minister</strong> in the Council of Ministers.</p>
<p>The decision was made following a <strong>review of departmental performances</strong>, which revealed that the higher education department ranked poorly. None of the state-run universities has come in the top <strong>100 of the recent NIRF ranking.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ministers’ argument:</strong> He took charge of the education department only last year and needs more time to bring about radical changes in the education of the state.</p>
<p><strong>Ethical issues concerning the case:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fairness and Transparency</strong> in Appointment and Removal of Ministers after objective evaluation.</li>
<li><strong>Accountability</strong>: While it is crucial to hold individuals accountable for their performance, it is also important to consider the <strong>broader systemic issues</strong> that may have contributed to the poor ranking of the higher education department.</li>
<li><strong>Time and Expectations</strong>: It is important to strike a balance between <strong>accountability</strong> and providing <strong>adequate opportunities for improvement and reform</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on Education</strong>: The removal of a minister and potential changes in leadership can have implications for the <strong>continuity and stability of policies</strong> and initiatives in the education sector.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Meghalaya is facing a severe water crisis, with a significant decline in rainfall and depleted water sources.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons for the water crisis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A significant decrease in rainfall, climate change</strong>, deforestation, and unsustainable water management practices.</li>
<li>Meghalaya <strong>heavily relies on monsoons</strong> for its water supply, power, and agriculture. The <strong>decline in rainfall</strong> has led to depleted water sources, particularly in urban areas.</li>
<li><strong>Operational concerns within the Public Health Engineering department</strong>, such as water losses and unaccounted-for water, also contribute to the crisis.</li>
<li><strong>Insufficient rainfall</strong> has also caused a power crisis (using hydropower), with the main power source at risk of being shut down, further compounding the water crisis.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why meghalaya is called the ‘abode of clouds’?</strong></p>
<p>Meghalaya is called the ‘abode of clouds’ because it receives heavy rainfall throughout the year, leading to a cloudy and misty atmosphere.</p>
<p><strong>Geographical reason:</strong></p>
<p>Meghalaya receives rainfall throughout the year due to its <strong>geographical location and topography</strong>. The region is surrounded by <strong>hills and mountains</strong>. It is influenced by the southwest monsoon winds that bring moisture from the Bay of Bengal. The hilly terrain and dense forests of Meghalaya act as barriers, causing the moisture-laden clouds from the Southwest monsoon to rise and condense, resulting in continuous rainfall. This geographical setup creates a <strong>unique microclimate in Meghalaya</strong>, making it one of the wettest places on Earth.</p>
<p><strong>About Mawsynram:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Mawsynram</strong>, in Meghalaya, receives the highest rainfall in India. It is reportedly the <strong>wettest place on Earth</strong>, with an average annual rainfall of 11,872 millimetres. <strong>Mawsynram</strong> lies in the <strong>funnel-shaped depression</strong> caused by the <strong>Khasi range in Meghalaya</strong>.</p>
