<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes in India have had a positive impact on production, employment generation, economic growth, and exports.</p>
<p><strong>About PLI Scheme:</strong> </p>
<p>In the PLI Scheme, <strong>companies receive financial incentives or rewards</strong> based on their production and sales. For example, if a company makes more smartphones in India, they can earn a bonus from the government. This encourages companies to increase production, create jobs, and boost the country’s economy.</p>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Affects competition</strong></td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Policymakers <strong>should not excessively depend on the PLI scheme</strong>. It is not a way out of the inadequacies in the manufacturing sector. Modern manufacturing depends on <strong>complex supply chains and giving fiscal incentives</strong> to one set of producers may not work. So, the government will have to work on <strong>improving the overall industrial environment</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/explained-what-has-india-done-to-address-child-trafficking/article66945216.ece#:~:text=The%20Prohibition%20of%20Child%20Marriage,during%20the%20COVID%2D19%20pandemic."><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Several reports since the 2020 lockdown have noted that the <strong>pandemic created a second crisis of child trafficking</strong>, with children being pushed into “despair, disease and death.”</p>
<p><strong>Child trafficking:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Child labour</strong> is a form of modern slavery that includes any work that deprives children of their childhood, potential and dignity, and physical or mental development. (ILO)</li>
<li><strong>The practice includes trafficking</strong>, sexual exploitation, debt bondage, and exploitation in armed conflicts.</li>
<li><strong>Child trafficking</strong> manifests in the form of domestic labour, forced child labour across industries, and illegal activities such as begging, organ trade and commercial sex purposes.</li>
<li>Estimates show that children account for <strong>one in every three detected victims of trafficking worldwide.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prevalence in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>According to the NCRB, <strong>8 children were trafficked every day in India in 2021</strong> for labour, begging and sexual exploitation.</li>
<li><strong>95%</strong> of the reported cases in 2019 were of <strong>internal trafficking</strong>.</li>
<li>The sale of children happens <strong>across borders too</strong>, with key routes being India to <strong>Gulf States</strong> (for ‘khadama’ to work as housemaids) <strong>and South East Asian countries</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Most vulnerable:</strong> Minor girls in the age bracket 15-18 years, as they are in greater demand for the sex trade industry and domestic labour.</p>
<p><strong>Main reasons for child trafficking in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Poverty, hunger, and lack of work.</li>
<li>This year’s <strong>World Day Against Child Labour</strong> (June 12) emphasised <strong>social injustices</strong> (caste and community-based discrimination and unfair treatment) as the root causes of child labour and trafficking.</li>
<li>Externalities such as the <strong>COVID-19 pandemic, armed conflict, and climate change</strong>.</li>
<li>Vulnerable to <strong>online</strong> sexual predators.</li>
<li>More than 40% of children trafficked were <strong>recruited by a family member or relative.</strong></li>
</ul>

<td><strong>Laws</strong></td>
<td><strong>Salient Provisions/ Issues</strong></td>

<tr>
<td><strong>The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act 1956</strong></td>
<td>It is targeted at stopping immoral trafficking and sex work.<br><br>It is criticised for criminalising sex workers without providing sufficient legal recourse or scope for rehabilitation, <strong>falsely presuming that all trafficking is done for sex work only.</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act 2006</strong></td>
<td>It prohibits and penalises the act of child marriage.<br><br>However, there is a <strong>rise in child marriage and sexual abuse</strong> during the COVID-19 pandemic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act 1986</strong></td>
<td>In 2016, an amendment completely banned the employment of children below 14 years; adolescents aged 14-18 years are not allowed to work in hazardous working conditions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act 1976</strong></td>
<td>It prohibits systems of labour where people, including children, work under conditions of servitude to pay off debt, and also provides a framework for rehabilitating released labourers.<br><br>22 States and UTs <strong>did not report identifying any bonded labour victims or filing a case under the law.</strong></td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act 2012</strong></td>
<td>It seeks to prevent commercial sexual exploitation of children.</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>The Trafficking in Persons (Prevention, Care and Rehabilitation) Bill</strong></td>
<td>The MWCD published the Draft of the Bill in 2021, <strong>detailing measures to prevent, protect and rehabilitate victims</strong>.<br><br>There are specified penalties for offences divided into “<strong>trafficking</strong>” and “<strong>aggravated</strong> <strong>trafficking</strong>”. It widened the scope of “victims” to include <strong>transgender persons</strong>.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>The penalty for trafficking minors:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>For trafficking one minor</strong> imprisonment from 10 years to life, along with a fine.</li>
<li><strong>For trafficking more than one minor</strong>, the penalty is life in prison and a fine.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Anti-Human Trafficking Units (AHTUs):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>India set up AHTUs in 2007</strong>, which are tasked with addressing the existing gaps in the law enforcement response, ensuring a victim-centric approach, developing databases on traffickers, etc.</li>
<li><strong>As of 2022, 768 AHTUs are functional in the country</strong>; 20 out of 36 States and UTs have met the target of setting units across all districts.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Concerns:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gross underestimate of the true extent:</strong> Child trafficking does not account for missing children <strong>–</strong> 1 child goes missing every 8 minutes in India.<ul>
<li>This is mainly due to a <strong>lack of awareness about the modalities of trafficking</strong>, reluctance to seek police help and socio-economic deprivation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Low conviction:</strong> Less than 10% of the reported cases end up in convictions.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of coordination among AHTUs</strong> and disjointed operations by State and Central Governments.</li>
<li><strong>Absence of a witness protection framework</strong> (the victim is also the witness) and challenges in accessing compensation.</li>
<li><strong>The Trafficking in Persons Bill</strong> violates the Juvenile Justice Act, as it places the <strong>burden of proof on the offender</strong> (the child) rather than the prosecuting agency.</li>
<li><strong>The 2022 Trafficking in Persons Report:</strong><ul>
<li>India <strong>does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking</strong> but is making significant efforts to do so.</li>
<li><strong>India doesn’t have a composite anti-trafficking law</strong> that addresses prevention, protection, rehabilitation and compensation of survivors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Community-based rehabilitation</strong> models allow the greater agency to the individual.</li>
<li><strong>Revisit existing laws</strong> to plug legal holes.</li>
<li><strong>Cultivate awareness about different trafficking crimes</strong>, and form targeted child protection schemes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The antidote to poverty-driven child labour is decent work for adults, so they can support their families and send their children to school, not to work. (ILO Director-General Gilbert F. Houngbo)</p>

<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Internal Security/ Effect of Politics of Developed and Developing Countries on India’s Interests</strong></p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The <strong>destruction of the Kakhovka Dam in Ukraine</strong> is a fast-moving disaster, developing into a long-term environmental catastrophe (termed as <strong>ecocide</strong>) and worsening the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/kakho.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/kakho.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>The Kakhovka Dam:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It was built in <strong>1956 (under the Soviet Union) on the Dnipro River in Ukraine</strong> (Kherson region) as part of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant.</li>
<li>The reservoir of the dam supplies water to the <strong>Crimean peninsula</strong> (annexed by Russia in 2014) and <strong>Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant</strong> (Europe’s largest and also under Russian control).</li>
<li>There are different <strong>theories behind the collapse of the dam</strong> – <strong>Ukraine blames Russia/</strong> Russia blames Ukraine/for collapse due to earlier damage.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact of the collapse:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Floods and destruction:</strong> The left bank of the Dnipro River remains under Ukrainian control, while the right side is controlled by the Russians.</li>
<li><strong>Agriculture and global food security:</strong> Often called the “<strong>bread basket</strong>” of the world, <strong>64% of Ukraine’s wheat</strong> is exported to developing countries. The flooding is likely to make <strong>arable lands unfit for agriculture</strong> for years to come due to increased salinity in the soil, as well as <strong>contamination of irrigation canals</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Energy security:</strong> Ukraine relies on its <strong>four nuclear power plants</strong>, considered to be a clean energy source, for over <strong>half of its energy needs</strong>. <strong>The damage to the hydroelectric dam</strong> is also a hit to the renewable energy resources in Ukraine.</li>
<li><strong>Fresh water supplies: For example,</strong> water levels in the North Crimea Canal, which brings fresh water from the Dnipro River to the Crimea peninsula, may decrease.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Use of water as a weapon of war:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The use of water as a weapon has a history stretching back to <strong>ancient times and it continues today</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>As climate change intensifies water scarcity</strong>, the value of water is likely to increase, thus <strong>incentivising its further use in conflict.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Damage to water infrastructure</strong> can be an <strong>accidental</strong> consequence of war or an <strong>intentional</strong></li>
<li>Sometimes, weaponising water serves both <strong>military and political goals.</strong> <strong>For example,</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Israel</strong> has restricted water resources to Palestinians to displace local populations and undermine Palestinian economic development.</li>
<li><strong>The Syrian regime</strong> repeatedly used water shortages against civilians and combatants during the Syrian civil war.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Upstream states</strong> can use water as leverage when negotiating (by threatening to cut or reduce the flow of water) with <strong>downstream</strong> states about a wide range of issues. <strong>For example,</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Pakistan (downstream) accused India (upstream)</strong> of waging ‘<strong>fifth-generation warfare</strong>‘ by restricting western rivers (Indus, Chenab, and Jhelum) flow to Pakistan.</li>
<li><strong>India accuses China</strong> of controlling the flow of water in <strong>the Brahmaputra River</strong> by building ‘super’ dams close to the Line of Actual Control (LAC).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ethical concerns related to the use of water as a weapon of war include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Violation of human rights and denial of access to clean water.</li>
<li>Environmental damage and ecological consequences.</li>
<li>Disproportionate impact on vulnerable populations.</li>
<li>Breach of international humanitarian law.</li>
<li>Long-term consequences and hindrance to post-conflict recovery.</li>
<li>Escalation of conflict and perpetuation of violence.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Geneva Conventions</strong> and their Additional Protocols regulate the conduct of armed conflict and seek to limit its effects.<ul>
<li>Under the additional protocols, <strong>attacks on water infrastructure</strong> such as dams can constitute a <strong>war crime</strong>, particularly if they cause significant harm to civilians.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <strong>international community</strong> needs to place greater emphasis on addressing the role of water in conflict.</li>
<li>However, much depends on how the international community <strong>responds and enforces consequences for such violations.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The tragic results of the Nova Kakhovka dam collapse should bring greater attention to the role that weaponising water is likely to play in the future.</p>

<p><strong>The circular economy</strong> is an economic model that aims to minimize waste and resource consumption by promoting reuse, recycling, and regeneration of materials and products.</p>
<p><strong>Examples are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>United Repair Centre (URC) (in Amsterdam)</strong> employs refugees as tailors to repair clothing, contributing to sustainability and prolonging garment lifespans.</li>
<li><strong>Start-up Madaster (in Amsterdam)</strong> created an online registry to track materials used in buildings, promoting reuse and reducing waste in the construction industry.</li>
<li><strong>Clothes Box Foundation</strong>: It is a not-for-profit organization that bestows clothes to less fortunate individuals.</li>
<li><strong>Binbag Recycling:</strong> It leverages technology to collect and recycle e-waste in formal channels.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Usage</strong>: The example can be cited in Environment questions to highlight the circular economy.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) <strong>will create a “common panel” consisting of registered insolvency professionals (IPs).</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This list will be <strong>shared in advance with the adjudicating authority.</strong></li>
<li>For appointment as <strong>IRP (interim resolution professional), Liquidator, RP (resolution professional) and BT (bankruptcy trustee).</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>purpose of this panel is to allow the authority to choose IPs from the list to oversee various cases of resolution or liquidation.</strong></p>
<p>Previously, the IBBI could only recommend an IP’s name after receiving a reference from the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in a corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP). This new measure <strong>aims to streamline the selection process and improve efficiency in handling insolvency cases.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Who are Insolvency professionals?</strong></p>
<p>They are individuals registered with the <strong>Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) who specialize in handling insolvency</strong> and bankruptcy proceedings. They are responsible for managing the affairs of the debtor, conducting investigations, gathering financial information, coordinating with creditors, and implementing the resolution plan or liquidation process by the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).</p>
<p><strong>About the</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/06/08/insolvency-and-bankruptcy-code/"><strong>IBC</strong></a><strong>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The IBC <strong>was enacted in 2016</strong>, replacing a host of laws, to <strong>streamline and speed up the resolution process of failed businesses.</strong></li>
<li>The Code also consolidates provisions of the <strong>current legislative framework to form a common forum for debtors and creditors of all classes to resolve insolvency.</strong></li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Scientists have <strong>“super-engineered” polio vaccines</strong> to <strong>prevent them from mutating</strong> into a dangerous form that can cause outbreaks and paralysis.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>wild poliovirus</strong> is currently limited to <strong>small pockets in Afghanistan and Pakistan</strong>, and oral vaccines play <strong>a crucial role in eradicating polio worldwide</strong>.</li>
<li>However, the <strong>oral vaccine has genetic instability</strong>, with just one mutation capable of reversing its safety and causing paralysis. <strong>Vaccine-derived polio cases now outnumber wild poliovirus cases</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are Vaccine-derived polio cases</strong>:</p>
<p>These are instances where the poliovirus in the <strong>oral polio vaccine (OPV) mutates and causes paralysis</strong> in vaccinated individuals or spreads to others in the community. These cases occur when the weakened virus in the vaccine reverts to a form that can cause disease.</p>
<p>To address this, researchers have <strong>genetically modified the weakened virus</strong>, making it more resistant to causing paralysis. The modified vaccines <strong>have shown promising results in human trials, providing more stability and addressing the instability concern (leading to Vaccine-derived polio cases.</strong></p>
<p>However, challenges <strong>remain in achieving full coverage and delivering vaccines to impoverished and conflict-affected areas</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>About Polio:</strong></p>
<p>Poliomyelitis, also known as polio, is an infection <strong>caused by a virus (poliovirus</strong>). It is a serious, highly contagious disease <strong>that can affect a person’s nervous system.</strong></p>
<p>There are three types of <strong>wild poliovirus</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>WPV 1: still exists but efforts are going on to eradicate it.</strong></li>
<li><strong>WPV 2: eradicated.</strong></li>
<li><strong>WPV 3: eradicated.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Polio typically <strong>affects children aged 5 years or younger</strong>. It can result in <strong>muscle weakness, permanent disability, and even death.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Context: Leptospirosis</strong> is a dangerous infectious disease that has <strong>become significant worldwide, especially during monsoon season</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is caused by the <strong>bacterium Leptospira interrogans</strong> and is primarily <strong>transmitted to humans through contact with the urine of infected animals.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The disease is <strong>more prevalent in warm, humid countries and is often associated with heavy rainfall or flooding</strong>. Leptospirosis can range from <strong>mild flu-like symptoms to severe organ dysfunction</strong>, and it is estimated to <strong>affect around 1.03 million people annually, resulting in approximately 60,000 deaths.</strong></p>
<p>Leptospirosis is often <strong>misdiagnosed due to its symptoms resembling those of dengue, malaria, and hepatitis</strong>. Limited access to <strong>reliable diagnostics, lack of awareness among physicians, and insufficient environmental surveillance further contribute to inaccurate reporting of cases.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Prevention:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Preventing leptospirosis requires effective <strong>health education, community empowerment, and the adoption of preventive measures</strong>. Although commonly referred to as <strong>“rat fever,” leptospirosis can be transmitted by various animals, and seasonal patterns and extreme weather events exacerbate its incidence.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Proper waste management, improved sanitation facilities, and control of stray animals</strong> is crucial in preventing the disease.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Recently, the <strong>fourth ship of the Survey Vessels (Large) (SVL) Project</strong>, named <strong>‘Sanshodhak’</strong>, was launched at <strong>Kattupalli, Chennai</strong>.</p>
<p>The project involves building <strong>four SVL ships for the Indian Navy by L&amp;T/GRSE.</strong> The SVL ships, with new-generation <strong>hydrographic equipment</strong>, will replace the existing Sandhayak Class survey ships and <strong>collect oceanographic data</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>‘Anjadip’</strong></p>
<p>Also, recently, the <strong>third 3rd Anti-Submarine Shallow Water Craft</strong> (ASMSWC) ship, <strong>‘Anjadip’</strong>, was launched.</p>
<p>It has been named after the strategically important island of <strong>Anjadip, situated off the coast of Karwar, Karnataka</strong> and connected to the mainland by a breakwater, the ship represents the vital maritime role played by the island.</p>
<p>The ASW SWC project involves the <strong>construction of a total of eight ships</strong>, designed to replace the existing Abhay class ASW Corvettes. These ships boast over <strong>80% indigenous content,</strong> promoting <strong>large-scale defence production</strong> by Indian manufacturing units and bolstering employment opportunities while strengthening the country’s capabilities in naval defence. ASWSWCs require <strong>less draft and can operate close to the coast</strong>, searching for underwater threats and neutralising enemy assets.</p>
<p><strong>Both the ships have been manufactured indigenously</strong> by Garden Reach Shipbuilders &amp; Engineers (GRSE) in collaboration with Larsen &amp; Toubro (L&amp;T) Shipbuilding.</p>

<p><strong>The Chite Lui River in Mizoram</strong> is of great cultural and sentimental value to the people of the state. However, the river is facing pollution and degradation due to unplanned urbanization, encroachments, and businesses located near its banks.</p>
<p><strong>The Chite Lui River</strong> originates from the <strong>Bawngkawn range in north Aizawl, Mizoram</strong>, and flows for approximately 20 km before joining the River Tuirial.</p>
<p><strong>Mizoram’s largest river is Chhimtuipui</strong>, originating in Myanmar (Burma). Other significant rivers in Mizoram include Tlawng, Tuirial, and Tuivawl, which flow through the northern territory and ultimately join the Barak River in Assam.</p>
