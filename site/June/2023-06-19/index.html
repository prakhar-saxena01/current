<h4 id="gs-paper-2"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Govt policies and interventions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/centre-sets-up-panel-led-by-former-law-secy-t-k-vishwanathan-to-recommend-reforms-in-arbitration-law/articleshow/101047183.cms?from=mdr"><strong>ET</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The government has set up an expert panel led by former law secretary <strong>T K Vishwanathan</strong> to recommend reforms in <strong>the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>3 methods of dispute resolution:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Traditional Dispute Resolution:</strong> Involves proceedings before an appropriate court of law according to the procedure established.</li>
<li><strong>Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR):</strong> These are more flexible and party-centric and include <strong>negotiation, mediation, conciliation and arbitration</strong>, and</li>
<li>Hybrid Methods of Dispute Resolution</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ADR.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ADR.png" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What is arbitration and conciliation?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Under arbitration, the parties concerned, <strong>instead of approaching courts, opt for private dispute resolution through arbitrators.</strong><ul>
<li>The decision of arbitrators is <strong>binding</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Conciliation is a (non-binding) process</strong> in which a third party helps the parties in dispute to resolve it by way of agreement. The person authorised to do so is called a Conciliator.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Need to evolve alternative mechanisms:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To reduce the burden of the Courts.</li>
<li>To provide speedy access to justice along with the revival and strengthening of traditional systems of dispute resolution.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Legal backing to the alternative mechanisms:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>‘Section 89’ in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908</strong>, opened the passage of statutory reference to ADR, either by the Courts or the parties themselves.</li>
<li><strong>The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996:</strong> The legislative intent of the Act is to bring domestic as well as international commercial arbitration in consonance with –<ul>
<li>The UNCITRAL Model Rules,</li>
<li>The New York Convention and the Geneva Convention.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Salient provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It <strong>consolidates and amends</strong> the law relating to –<ul>
<li>Domestic arbitration,</li>
<li>International commercial arbitration and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards, and</li>
<li>Define the law relating to conciliation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Act provides the procedure</strong> to be followed in arbitration proceedings, arbitral tribunal, the conduct of the tribunal along with the arbitral awards to be made in a dispute.</li>
<li><strong>The decision is binding</strong> on the parties and given in the form of an arbitral award in an arbitration agreement.</li>
<li><strong>It also prescribes the procedure of appeal</strong> to courts in case of discrepancies.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The main objective of the Act</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To make provision for an arbitral procedure</strong> which is fair, efficient and capable of meeting the needs of the specific arbitration.</li>
<li><strong>To minimise the supervisory role of the courts</strong> in the arbitral process.</li>
<li><strong>To permit an arbitral tribunal</strong> to use mediation, conciliation or other procedures during the arbitral proceedings in the settlement of the disputes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The main issue faced by the dispute resolution environment in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increased court intervention</strong> in the whole process.</li>
<li>Thus, arbitration has <strong>no longer remained</strong> a truly party-driven, cost-effective and time-bound process.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why is the T K Vishwanathan committee constituted?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As a continuous endeavour <strong>to promote ease of doing business</strong>, the Department of Legal Affairs is considering the need to further reform the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996.</li>
<li>This will help India become a <strong>hub for international arbitration and reduce the burden on courts.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The terms of reference for the committee:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To evaluate and analyse the operation of the present arbitration</strong> ecosystem of the country, including the working of the Arbitration Act.</li>
<li><strong>To highlight the Arbitration Act’s strengths and weaknesses</strong> and challenges vis-a-vis other important foreign jurisdictions.</li>
<li><strong>To recommend a framework of model arbitration system</strong> which is efficient, effective and economical and caters to the requirements of the users.</li>
<li><strong>To devise a strategy for developing a competitive environment</strong> in the arbitration services market for domestic and international parties.</li>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: The recent crisis in Manipur has <strong>sparked renewed interest in the Punchhi Commission Recommendations</strong>, which offer <strong>potential solutions for effectively managing such situations.</strong></p>
<p><strong>About Punchhi Commission:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The government constituted the <strong>Second Commission on Interstate Relations under the chairmanship of Justice (retired) Madan Mohan Punchhi</strong>, former Chief Justice of India along with other eminent persons in 2007.</li>
<li>The <strong>Commission set up eight task forces to examine the Centre-state relations in depth</strong>. Their Fifth Task Force studied <strong>criminal justice, national security and Centre-state cooperation</strong>.</li>
<li>The Commission submitted its report in 2010, <strong>but the government could not introduce constitutional changes recommended by the Punchhi Commission</strong>.</li>

<td><strong>Feasibility of legislation under Article 355</strong></td>
<td>Examined the possibility of enacting supporting legislation <strong>under Article 355</strong> to <strong>enable the suo motu deployment of Central forces in states</strong> when the situation demands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Localised Emergency provisions under Article 355</strong></td>
<td>Recommended the adoption of <strong>“Localised Emergency provisions”</strong> under <strong>Article 355,</strong> allowing the imposition of Central rule in a limited affected area of a state, such as a municipality or a district<strong>, while the rest of the elected state government continues undisturbed.</strong></td>

<td><strong>The time limit for Central rule under Article 355</strong></td>
<td>Proposed that the <strong>Central rule in a limited affected area should not extend beyond three months.</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Amendments to the Communal Violence Bill</strong></td>
<td>Suggested amendments to the <strong>Communal Violence Bill</strong> to include provisions <strong>that state consent should not hinder the deployment of Central forces in serious communal riots.</strong> However, the deployment should be limited to one week, with post-facto consent obtained from the state.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>A historical example of countering insurgency</strong></td>
<td>Cited the example of countering the <strong>Telangana insurgency in 1950,</strong> where the entire administration, including law and order, of a portion of the state was given to the <strong>Central Intelligence Bureau with a mandate to eliminate insurgents within six months.</strong></td>

<p><strong>Significance of these recommendations</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The implementation of these recommendations <strong>could have potentially allowed the Centre to take over the administration of specific areas in Manipur without disrupting the elected government</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>If these recommendations had been codified through constitutional amendments, <strong>they could have provided a political solution to the ongoing conflicts in Manipur and other regions</strong>, allowing for more effective management of such situations.</p>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/how-india-can-lead-multilateralism-at-wto-8667817/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The recently concluded <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/04/10/sansad-tv-world360-degree-g20/">G20</a> working group meeting on trade and investment focused on the important issue of WTO reform.</p>
<p><strong>World Trade Organization (WTO):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is a member-driven, consensus-based <strong>intergovernmental organisation</strong> that regulates and facilitates international trade between nations.</li>
<li>It is the <strong>world’s largest international economic organisation</strong> (HQ – Geneva, Switzerland), with <strong>164 member states</strong> representing over 98% of global trade and global GDP.</li>
<li>It officially began operations on January 1, <strong>1995</strong>, in accordance with the 1994 <strong>Marrakesh Agreement.</strong></li>
<li>It replaced the 1948 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What led to the establishment of the WTO?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The prevailing idea that trade policy is foreign policy</strong> because economic interdependence would deter security confrontation.</li>
<li>The WTO aimed at <strong>legalising and policing economic interdependence</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Current situation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Today’s world is dominated by <strong>geoeconomic considerations and heightened securitisation</strong> of international economic relations.</li>
<li><strong>The pursuit of unilateralism</strong> in international economic relations, especially by developed countries like the US.</li>
<li>Economic policies such as <strong>industrial subsidies and local content requirements</strong> have made a comeback.</li>
<li>There is a <strong>deliberate effort to weaken trade multilateralism</strong> in favour of external plurilateral alignments keeping the big power confrontation in mind.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong> A weak WTO perfectly suits the US as part of its foreign policy aimed at strategic rivalry with China.</p>
<p><strong>The role to be played by G20:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The G20 members are key players in the WTO.</li>
<li>The push for WTO reforms must come from <strong>G20’s “middle powers”</strong> such as <em>India, Indonesia, Brazil, and South Africa</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Critical areas that developing countries should focus on:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The presence of special and differential treatment (SDT) principles</strong> in WTO agreements.<ul>
<li>SDT provisions give <strong>special rights to developing countries</strong> and obligate developed countries to treat the former more favourably.</li>
<li>However, <strong>only 21%</strong> of the SDT provisions in various WTO agreements oblige developed countries to actually provide differential treatment to developing countries.</li>
<li>Therefore, SDT provisions need to be given <strong>more teeth and any effort to weaken this treaty-embedded right</strong> in the name of WTO reform should be opposed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The appellate body</strong> – the 2nd tier of the WTO’s two-tiered dispute settlement body – remains paralysed since 2019.<ul>
<li>This is part of the US’s overall game plan <strong>to dilute the policing part of the WTO</strong> to pursue trade unilateralism without many checks.</li>
<li>The remaining G20 countries need to either persuade the US or resurrect the appellate body without the US.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>There is a need to develop a multilateral governance framework for plurilateral agreements</strong>.<ul>
<li>From 2017 onward, there has been <strong>a shift away from consensus-based decision-making principles</strong> toward plurilateral discussions on issues like investment facilitation.</li>
<li>However, forcing plurilateral agreements on non-willing members will accentuate the <strong>trust deficit between developed and developing countries.</strong></li>
<li>Therefore, <strong>a multilateral governance framework</strong> should include key principles of <strong>non-discrimination, transparency and inclusivity</strong> in the WTO rulebook.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>It is imperative to address the transparency gap in the WTO.</strong><ul>
<li>Although WTO member countries are obliged to notify all their laws and regulations that affect trade, compliance with this obligation is poor.</li>
<li><strong>This increases the cost of trade, especially for developing countries.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trade multilateralism</strong> might be out of fashion, but remains of vital salience for countries like India.</li>
<li>Therefore, under its Presidency of the G20, India should work with others to drive the WTO reforms agenda aimed at making <strong>trade multilateralism inclusive.</strong></li>

<p>Switzerland has supported a <strong>new climate bill aimed</strong> at achieving <strong>carbon neutrality by 2050, with nearly 59% of voters in favour</strong>. The law seeks to reduce dependence on imported oil and gas and promote <strong>greener alternatives</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/excessive-groundwater-depletion-has-knocked-earths-axis-off-kilter/article66980307.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> A recent study published in the journal <strong>Geophysical Research Letters</strong> reveals that extensive groundwater extraction by humans has had a significant effect on Earth’s rotation.</p>
<p><strong>Findings:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Between 1993 and 2010</strong>, the excessive pumping of groundwater caused the <strong>planet’s rotational pole to shift eastward by approximately 80 centimetres.</strong> The research indicates that humans extracted around 2<strong>,150 gigatons of groundwater</strong> during this period, equivalent to over 6 millimetres of sea-level rise.</p>
<p><strong>How groundwater extraction influences Earth’s rotation?</strong></p>
<p>When we take a lot of water out from underground (groundwater extraction), it changes how the Earth spins (called ‘polar drift’).</p>
<p><strong>Imagine spinning a top and then adding or removing weight from one side</strong>. The top will wobble or spin differently. Similarly, when we extract groundwater, it shifts the weight distribution on Earth’s surface, causing a slight change in its rotation. This can move the Earth’s axis (the imaginary line it spins around) a little bit.</p>

<p><strong>Impact:</strong></p>
<p><strong>While it doesn’t affect our daily lives much</strong>, scientists study these changes because <strong>they can impact the Earth’s climate</strong> over long periods of time.</p>
<p><strong>Other factors: Melting of glaciers</strong> -Climate change has caused billions of tonnes of glacial ice to melt into oceans. This has caused the Earth’s poles to move in new directions.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Germany has proposed <strong>transitioning to carbon-neutral synthetic fuels</strong> for existing internal combustion vehicles instead of phasing them out completely.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons for such a proposal:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Even though electric vehicles and hydrogen fuel</strong> cells <strong>have zero-emission during usage</strong>, their manufacturing processes have significant environmental impacts.</li>
<li><strong>Approximately 90% of the world’s vehicles</strong> are expected to be internal combustion by 2030, and replacing them entirely would not be a zero-carbon solution.</li>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/y-chromosome-maleness-biological-function-loss/article66982017.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: Researchers have discovered that the Y chromosome <strong>possesses genes linked to ageing and lifespan regulation.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Y chromosome, known as the <strong>“master of maleness,”</strong> determines <strong>the biological male sex and carries genes that play a role in sex determination.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Recent research has revealed that the Y <strong>chromosome possesses genes vital to biological functions, including those related to ageing and lifespan regulation.</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>study of species that have naturally lost their Y chromosome</strong>, such as rodents, provides insights <strong>into sex-chromosome turnover and the repurposing of other chromosomes as sex chromosomes</strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong>genome sequences of Neanderthals indicate the replacement of the Y chromosome in modern humans, suggesting that the Y chromosome may eventually yield its role as the “master of maleness” to another chromosome.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Chromosomes:</strong></p>
<p>Chromosomes are <strong>thread-like structures found in the nucleus of cells</strong> that carry genetic information. Chromosomes come in pairs, with <strong>each pair containing one chromosome inherited from the mother and one from the father</strong>. Humans typically have <strong>23 pairs of chromosomes</strong>, for a total of <strong>46 chromosomes</strong> in most cells (except for reproductive cells which have 23 chromosomes). Chromosomes play a <strong>crucial role in cell division and inheritance.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: Researchers <strong>demystify the unusual origin of the Geminids meteor shower.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NASA’s Parker Solar Probe</strong> mission is providing new evidence that a violent, catastrophic event created the Geminids.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While most meteor showers originate from comets, the Geminids are believed to come from an <strong>asteroid called 3200 Phaethon</strong>. Unlike comets, <strong>asteroids like Phaethon are not typically affected by the Sun’s heat.</strong></li>
<li>By analysing the data collected by the Parker Solar Probe, the <strong>scientists modelled three possible scenarios for the formation of the Geminid stream and compared them to existing models based on Earth-based observations</strong>.</li>
<li>They concluded that violent scenarios, <strong>such as high-speed collisions or gaseous explosions, were the most consistent with the Parker data</strong>. This suggests that a sudden and powerful event likely triggered the creation of the Geminid meteor stream from Phaethon.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About the mission:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>The Parker Solar Probe is a NASA space probe launched in 2018</strong> with the mission of making observations of the <strong>outer corona of the Sun</strong>. It will approach the <strong>closest</strong> to the sun by 2025.</p>

<p>The mass deaths of <strong>approximately 300 wild birds along Mexico’s Pacific coast</strong> are likely attributed to El Niño. Warmer waters (due to El Nino) cause fish to swim deeper, making it harder for seabirds to find food, which could be a contributing factor to the bird deaths. Similar occurrences of dead seabirds were reported in <strong>Peru and Chile.</strong></p>
