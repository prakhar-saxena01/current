<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Climate/ Conservation, Environmental Pollution and Degradation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/climate-change/icimod-report-rings-warning-bells-for-rivers-of-east-northeast-india-90154"><strong>DTE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development <strong>(ICIMOD)</strong> released the Water, Ice, Society, and Ecosystems in the Hindu Kush Himalaya <strong>(HI-WISE) report</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hindu_kush.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/hindu_kush.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>The Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH) region:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is a vast area, encompassing mountain ranges stretching from<ul>
<li>the Hindu Kush range in northern Afghanistan to the Arakan range in Myanmar,</li>
<li>with the Himalayan range as its spine, and also includes the Tibetan Plateau.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The region harbours the highest mountain ranges in the world</strong> and contains the largest volume of ice on earth outside of the polar areas and is called “<strong>Asia’s water tower</strong>”.</li>
<li><strong>Ice and snow in the HKH</strong> are important sources of water for 12 rivers that flow through 16 countries in Asia.</li>
<li>These rivers provide <strong>freshwater and other vital ecosystem services</strong> to 240 million people in the mountains and a further 1.65 billion downstream.</li>
<li>The region is undergoing “unprecedented and largely irreversible” changes triggered by <strong>global warming.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ICIMOD:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is <strong>a regional intergovernmental learning and knowledge-sharing centre</strong> serving the <strong>8</strong> regional member countries (RMCs) of the HKH region – Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar, Nepal, and Pakistan.</li>
<li>It was established in <strong>1983</strong> and is headquartered at Lalitpur, which is located in the Kathmandu valley of</li>
<li>ICIMOD <strong>promotes and fosters partnerships amongst the RMCs</strong> to secure a better future for the people and environment of the HKH region.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Findings of the report:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Many areas around the world have <strong>passed “peak water” and communities</strong> are dealing with less glacier meltwater.</li>
<li>For the HKH, <strong>the peak point has not been reached yet</strong>, but it is coming soon.</li>
<li>As Himalayan glaciers <strong>melt</strong> due to <strong>climate change, water availability</strong> in the Indus, Ganges, and Brahmaputra is set to <strong>increase</strong> (through 2050) in the short term and <strong>decrease</strong> in the long term (~80% by 2100).</li>
<li><strong>The Eastern/ lesser Himalayas</strong> have fewer glaciers compared to their western counterparts. Hence, rivers in the region get less contribution from glaciers and <strong>are less likely to be affected overall.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Climate change</strong> is severely affecting <strong>biodiversity</strong> in HKH<strong>. For example,</strong> the habitat of Himalayan ibex is likely to reduce by 33 to 64%.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Concerns:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The glaciers act as a savings bank account/ buffer in the hydrological cycle. However, <strong>the HKH has seen a 65% faster loss of glacier mass</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>There is a chance for more floods</strong> <strong>and landslides</strong> and a loss of savings during the dry years.</li>
<li>Decreasing snow cover could dry up springs, which is bad for <strong>agriculture</strong> and will <strong>jeopardise the livelihoods of 129 million farmers</strong> in the Indus, Ganges and Brahmaputra basins.</li>
<li><strong>This will make adaptation even harder</strong>, as people and ecosystems need to adapt not only to decreasing snow cover but also to decreasing meltwater.</li>
<li><strong>Institutions</strong> aren’t equipped to handle the new dangers and fail to take climate change threats into account.</li>
<li><strong>Governments</strong> have played a limited role in helping mountain communities of the HKH <strong>adapt to climate change</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Generalised reports need to be replaced by specific ones:</strong> It would have been great if the report could have told which areas of the Himalayas are expected to be affected and how much.</li>
<li><strong>Mountain-specific adaptation practices:</strong> As adaptation in one place might end up being maladaptation in another, the RMCs need to develop/ share a database on adaptation practices.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> As the mountain population and biodiversity of the region (40% of which is under protected areas) are dependent on the <strong>cryosphere</strong> (the frozen water part of the Earth system), urgent adaptation measures need to be adopted.</p>

<p><strong>Syllabus: Environment Conservation: Climate Finance</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/a-summit-with-substance/article66986234.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a><strong>,</strong> <a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/world/tax-super-rich-to-pay-global-south-for-climate-damages-open-letter-to-world-leaders-by-economists-ahead-of-paris-talks-90134"><strong>DTE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The New Global Financing Pact is an international agreement or framework set to take place in Paris, France.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>India, the president of the G20 this year</strong>, is co-chairing the steering committee of the summit with France</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Aim of the proposed Pact:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is aimed at addressing the financing needs of sustainable development and climate action.</li>
<li>It focuses on <strong>mobilizing funds from various sources, including public and private sectors</strong>, to support initiatives that promote economic growth, poverty eradication, and environmental sustainability.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Need of the Pact:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>According to One Planet Lab’s white papers</strong> released for the Summit, the scale of investment needed to meet the <strong>United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals</strong>, climate COP21 and Biodiversity COP15 objectives set at the global and national levels is to the tune of an <strong>additional $4 trillion every year.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Only 25% of global climate investment</strong> goes to South Asia, Latin America, and Africa, which house some of the most vulnerable regions.</li>
<li><strong>Global funds clamp down</strong> on the fiscal independence of less developed countries by posing several conditions before the money comes in.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Proposals for increasing Climate financing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rich Tax:</strong> A group of over <strong>140 economists has written an open letter</strong> urging world leaders to impose a special tax on the wealth of the super-rich to raise funds for the Global South to address climate change impacts. <strong>They propose a 2% tax on extreme wealth</strong>, which could generate over $2 trillion annually.</li>
<li><strong>The summit should include three components</strong>:<ul>
<li>A pact for global finance flows at the domestic and international levels</li>
<li>A platform to de-risk finance and attract private investment in sustainable infrastructure</li>
<li>A political pathway with time-bound deliverables on climate finance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Other suggestions include:</strong><ul>
<li>Cancelling illegitimate debts</li>
<li>Withdrawing support for fossil fuel projects</li>
<li>Making polluting industries pay for damages</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>The pact aims to <strong>bridge the gap between the funding required to achieve global goals</strong>, such as the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement on climate change, and the actual funding available. It may involve innovative financial mechanisms, tax reforms, and international cooperation to ensure adequate and predictable financing for development priorities.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Diplomats from around the world met once again in the German city of Bonn for climate negotiations before the UNFCCC’s COP28 in Dubai, UAE.</p>
<p><strong>The objective of the conference:</strong> To chart out a <strong>massive and immediate climate action</strong> plan to keep alive any realistic chance of meeting the 1.5-degree or 2-degree Celsius targets.</p>
<p><strong>The key issue at Bonn – Global Stocktake (GST):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mandated by the <strong>2015 Paris Agreement</strong>, GST is an exercise aimed at <strong>assessing the progress in the fight against climate change</strong>, and deciding ways and means to enhance global action to bridge the adequacy gap.</li>
<li>The Paris Agreement says GST <strong>must be conducted every five years, starting in 2023.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Outcome: The Bonn conference produced a short framework</strong> on the elements to be included in the stocktake exercise.</p>
<p><strong>The bone of contention between the developed and developing countries:</strong> Provisions related to <strong>finance and historical responsibility</strong> of the rich countries.</p>
<p><strong>Historical responsibility:</strong></p>

<li>A bulk of the accumulated GHGs, the reason for global warming, <strong>have come from a group of about 40 rich and industrialised countries</strong>, usually referred to as <strong>Annex I countries</strong> in the 1992 UNFCCC.</li>
<li>This historical responsibility has been the basis for the <strong>differentiated burden-sharing between developed and developing countries</strong> in the climate change framework.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The argument of Annex I countries:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Historical emissions happened at a time <strong>when there were –</strong><ul>
<li><strong>No alternative to fossil fuel-based energy sources</strong></li>
<li>Little understanding or consensus on the harm caused by GHGs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Since 1992,<ul>
<li><strong>~57%</strong> of the CO2 emissions had come from non-Annex I countries.</li>
<li><strong>~70%</strong> of the incremental warming due to emissions from CO2, methane and sulphur dioxide had come from non-Annex I countries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hence, bridging the adequacy gap was <strong>not the sole responsibility of the developed nations.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Finance and technology transfers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mitigation Work Programme (MWP)</strong> – a temporary emergency exercise focused only on increasing emission cuts, was set up at COP26 in Glasgow in 2021 for climate action.</li>
<li>Discussions at the MWP ran into trouble after developing countries complained that <strong>developed countries were yet to offer the enabling finance and technology transfers.</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Developed countries are under an obligation</strong> to support the implementation of climate action plans of developing countries through money and tech transfers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Global emissions have to come down by 43% from 2019 levels by 2030</strong> to keep alive hopes of meeting the <strong>1.</strong><strong>5-degree target (IPCC).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Developing countries need as much as US$ 6 trillion</strong> between now and 2030 just to implement their climate action plans.<ul>
<li><strong>The loss and damage</strong> needs of developing countries are assessed to be about US$ 400 billion every year.</li>
<li>Against this, <strong>even a minuscule US$ 100 billion per year</strong> that the developed countries had committed to raising from 2020 is not fully available.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The Summit for a New Global Financial Pact is an attempt at redirecting global financial flows and raising new money to fight climate change, and dealing with associated problems like biodiversity loss and poverty.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Punjab Assembly has amended the <strong>Sikh Gurdwaras Act, 1925</strong> to allow the broadcast of <strong>Gurbani (sacred hymns) from Sri Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple)</strong> to be accessible to all media outlets free of cost.</p>
<p>This move aims to break the <strong>alleged monopoly of PTC</strong>, a television channel associated with the <strong>Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) party</strong>.</p>
<p>The decision has sparked controversy, with the opposition party questioning the Punjab Assembly’s authority to amend the Gurdwaras Act without the consent of the <strong>Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC)</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>About SGPC:</strong></p>
<p>The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (est. 1920; HQ: Amritsar) is an organization in India responsible for the <strong>management of Gurdwaras, Sikh places of worship</strong> in the <strong>states of Punjab and Himachal Pradesh</strong> and the <strong>union territory of Chandigarh</strong>. SGPC also administers <strong>Darbar Sahib in Amritsar</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>About Golden Temple</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Golden Temple (completed 1589) is a gurdwara</strong> located in the city of Amritsar, Punjab. It is the preeminent spiritual site of <strong>Sikhism</strong>. It is one of the holiest sites in Sikhism, alongside the <strong>Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur</strong> in Kartarpur, and <strong>Gurdwara Janam Asthan in Nankana Sahib.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The man-made pool</strong>on the site of the temple was completed by the fourth Sikh Guru, Guru <strong>Ram Das, in 1577.</strong></li>
<li>In 1604, <strong>Guru Arjan Dev, the fifth Sikh Guru</strong>, placed a copy of the <strong>Adi Granth in Harmandir Sahib</strong> and is the prominent figure in the development of gurudwara who built it in the 16th Century</li>
<li><strong>Maharaja Ranjit Singh</strong>, after founding the <strong>Sikh Empire, rebuilt it in marble and copper</strong>in 1809, and overlaid the sanctum with gold leaf in 1830.</li>
<li>It became a centre of the <strong>Singh Sabha Movement</strong>between 1883 and 1920s, and the <strong>Punjabi Suba movement</strong> between 1947 and 1966.</li>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/science-technology/scientists-find-link-between-surges-of-cosmic-radiation-from-space-and-earthquakes-90152"><strong>DTE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> A recent study revealed that scientists have identified a <strong>striking link between earthquakes</strong> and <strong>changes in the intensity of cosmic radiation</strong> measured on Earth’s surface.</p>
<p><strong>What is Cosmic Radiation?</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Cosmic radiation refers to high-energy particles</strong>, mainly protons and atomic nuclei, that originate from outer space and travel through the universe. These particles are produced by various celestial phenomena, such as <strong>supernovae, black holes, and active galactic nuclei.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Researchers <strong>discovered that by shifting cosmic ray data 15 days ahead of seismic data, earthquakes could potentially be predicted up to two weeks in advance.</strong></li>
<li>The researchers conducted their study through the <strong>Cosmic Ray Extremely Distributed Observatory (CREDO) project</strong>, an international virtual <strong>observatory that collects and processes data from various detectors, including smartphone sensors converted into cosmic ray detectors using a simple app.</strong></li>
<li>The research suggests that changes in Earth’s magnetic field, caused by <strong>disturbances in the planet’s dynamo flows during significant earthquakes, can impact the path of primary cosmic radiation, leading to observable changes in secondary cosmic ray particle counts.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Notably, the correlation between cosmic ray intensity and earthquakes is apparent on a global scale, rather than specific locations, <strong>raising questions about the potential influence of phenomena such as dark matter streams.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong>  The <strong>State of the Climate in Europe 2022 report,</strong> produced by the World Meteorological Organization and the <strong>European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service</strong>, reveals that Europe has been warming twice as fast as the global average since the 1980s.</p>
<ul>
<li>In 2022, Europe’s average temperature was approximately <strong>2.</strong><strong>3 °C above the pre-industrial baseline.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Rates of surface ocean warming</strong>, particularly in the <strong>eastern Mediterranean Sea, the Baltic and Black Seas, and the southern Arctic</strong> were more than three times the global average.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wind and solar power generated</strong> over 22% of European Union (EU) electricity in 2022, overtaking fossil gas (20%).</li>
<li><strong>The record-breaking heat stress</strong> that Europeans <strong>experienced in 2022</strong> was one of the main drivers of weather-related excess deaths in Europe</li>
