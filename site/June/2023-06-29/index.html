<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Geomorphology/Climate/ Conservation, Environmental Pollution and Degradation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/climate-change/rockies-alps-himalayas-more-rain-less-snow-in-northern-hemisphere-mountains-as-temperatures-rise-says-report-90308"><strong>DTE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> According to a new study, a rise in temperature due to climate change could cause a shift in snowfall to rainfall in mountain regions across the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p><strong>Findings of the study:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The mountains across the Northern Hemisphere are likely to see <strong>15% more rain for every 1-degree Celsius rise in temperature</strong> due to climate change.</li>
<li><strong>For 2 degrees and 3 degrees rise</strong>, the world would see a 30 and 45% increase in rain, respectively.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Most vulnerable:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Himalayas and the North American Pacific Mountain ranges</strong>, including the Cascades, Sierra Nevada, and coastal ranges from Canada to Southern California are more threatened than the Rockies or the Alps.</li>
<li><strong>The Himalayas</strong> is one of those hotspot regions where an increased risk (due to changes in atmospheric dynamics) of rainfall extremes is witnessed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A change in air temperature will shift snowfall in these regions to rainfall and <strong>could increase the risk of disasters</strong> such as floods, landslides, and soil erosion<strong>.</strong></li>
<li><strong>26% of the global population</strong> living in or directly downstream of these mountainous regions is going to be directly affected by this risk.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Concerns raised in the Water, Ice, Society, and Ecosystems in the Hindu Kush Himalaya (</strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/21/icimod-report-water-ice-society-and-ecosystems-in-the-hindu-kush-himalaya/"><strong>HI-WISE</strong></a><strong>) report:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The ICIMOD report found that the <strong>Hindu Kush Himalayas have seen a 65% faster loss of glacier mass.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Water availability</strong> in the Indus, Ganges, and Brahmaputra is set to <strong>increase</strong> (through 2050) in the short term and <strong>decrease</strong> in the long term (~80% by 2100).</li>
<li><strong>Climate change</strong> is severely affecting <strong>biodiversity</strong> in HKH<strong>. For example,</strong> the habitat of Himalayan ibex is likely to reduce by 33 to 64%.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead: Developing mountain-specific climate adaptation plans</strong> to protect the natural and built environments.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Union Cabinet, chaired by the PM of India, approved the National Research Foundation (NRF) Bill 2023, to give the nation’s scientific research a strategic direction.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights of the Bill: It will establish NRF</strong> and <strong>repeal the Science and Engineering Research Board</strong> (SERB) – subsuming it into the NRF.</p>
<ul>
<li>SERB is <strong>a statutory body</strong> under the <strong>Department of Science and Technology</strong> (DST) established in 2009 (by the SERB Act, 2008).</li>
<li>It was set up for <strong>promoting basic research in science and engineering</strong> and <strong>to provide financial assistance</strong> to scientists, academic institutions, R&amp;D laboratories, S&amp;T start-ups, etc.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> A study quoted by the <strong>World Resources Institute’s Global Forest Watch</strong> reveals that tropical areas experienced a <strong>significant decline in forest cover in 2022.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Key findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The loss amounted to <strong>4.</strong><strong>1 million hectares</strong>, equivalent to an area the size of 11 football fields disappearing <strong>every minute</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>The primary forest cover loss</strong> in tropical regions was <strong>10% higher in 2022</strong> compared to the previous year.</li>
<li><strong>The study highlights that the world is not on track to meet its forest-related commitments:</strong></li>
<li>Two key goals set by the World Resources Institute include <strong>ending deforestation by 2030</strong><ul>
<li>However, the global deforestation rate <strong>needs to decrease by at least</strong> <strong>10% annually</strong> to meet the 2030 target.</li>
<li>While deforestation rates reduced <strong>by 3.1% in 2022 compared</strong> to the 2018-2020 baseline, they still exceeded the necessary levels by over one million hectares, indicating a deviation from the 2030 goal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Restoring 350 million hectares of lost and degraded forests by 2030</strong>.<ul>
<li>The overall change in <strong>tree cover over the past two decades</strong> has been a <strong>net loss of 100 million hectares.</strong> This indicates that forests are still being lost instead of being restored at the required rate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Countries like <strong>Brazil and the Democratic Republic of Congo</strong>, with substantial tropical forest cover, <strong>experienced significant losses in 2022</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>India</strong>: The study also highlights <strong>India’s loss of 44 thousand hectares</strong> of humid primary forest between 2021 and 2022, accounting for <strong>17% of the country’s total tree cover</strong> loss during that period.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are Primary forests?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Primary forests, also known as old-growth forests or virgin forests</strong>, are mature and undisturbed natural forests that have not experienced significant human intervention or alteration in recent history. These forests have <strong>reached a stage of ecological maturity and exhibit a complex and diverse ecosystem</strong> with fully developed tree canopy layers, understory vegetation, and rich biodiversity.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Significance:</strong> They play a crucial role in <strong>storing carbon and supporting biodiversity</strong>. Once lost, the <strong>regrowth of secondary forests cannot match the ecological and carbon sequestration</strong> capabilities of primary forests.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Global Forest Watch (launched 2014) is an open-source web application</strong> to monitor global forests in near real-time. GFW is an initiative of the World Resources Institute, with partners including Google, USAID, the University of Maryland, Esri, Vizzuality and many other academic, non-profit, public, and private organizations.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Following the Union Budget 2023-24 announcement, the MoEFCC notified the draft ‘Green Credit Programme (GCP)’ implementation rules 2023.</p>
<p><strong>About the Green Credit Programme (GCP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Under this, individuals, industries, FPOs, ULBs, gram panchayats and private sectors, etc., will be able to <strong>earn “green credit” for undertaking environment-friendly actions</strong>.</li>
<li>The green credits will be <strong>tradable</strong> on a proposed domestic market platform.</li>
<li>It follows the principle of <strong>LiFE</strong> – Lifestyle for Environment – to encourage sustainable lifestyles by driving consumers/communities towards behavioural changes to incentivise environment-friendly practices.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The overall administration of the scheme:</strong> It will be under the <strong>Indian Council for Forestry Research and Education</strong> – an autonomous organisation/ governmental agency under the MoEFCC.</p>

<p><strong>Objectives of GCP:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To create a <strong>market-based</strong> (supply and demand) <strong>mechanism</strong> for incentivising voluntary environmental actions/ individual or community behaviour.</li>
<li><strong>To encourage the private sector</strong> as well as other entities to meet their existing obligations, stemming from other legal frameworks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>GCP vs carbon markets:</strong> Unlike carbon markets, where only greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were traded, the GCP accounts for a wide range of actions and <strong>nowhere in the world</strong> such a wide range of actions are considered.</p>
<p><strong>Significance of the GCP:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It’s a first-of-its-kind instrument that seeks to <strong>value and reward multiple ecosystem services</strong> to allow green projects to achieve optimal returns beyond just carbon.</li>
<li>The scheme will allow project proponents <strong>to also access carbon markets additionally.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Similar mechanisms elsewhere:</strong> In some countries (France, Germany and Sweden), <strong>social services generate credits</strong> – taking care of the elderly for a certain number of hours, for instance, gets one some credit that you can exchange in a salon.</p>
<p><strong>Concerns:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The draft was a good statement of intent but its <strong>implementation would be extremely challenging.</strong><ul>
<li>This is due to the difficulty in establishing the <strong>equivalence between various actions</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> how much water one saved is equivalent to a tonne of CO2 prevented from emissions is difficult to establish.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring, reporting and verification challenges.</strong></li>
<li><strong>A strong risk of greenwashing</strong> – the appearance of doing a lot without actually achieving much beneficial impact.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capacity needs to be built</strong> to monitor these systems and prevent fraud.</li>
<li><strong>It will save resources</strong> that could be diverted to more transformational pollution control and biodiversity protection efforts.</li>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>V.K. Pandian</strong>, an influential bureaucrat and the private secretary to Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, has become a target of criticism from the opposition and certain factions within the BJD party.</p>
<p>The complaint raised concerns about his u<strong>se of state transportation, public receptions, and announcements of new projects,</strong> suggesting a violation of All India Services (Conduct) Rules.</p>
<p><strong>The elaborate security measures and protocols accompanying Mr Pandian’s visits</strong> resemble those of <strong>chief ministers and union ministers</strong>, blurring the line between a politician and a bureaucrat.</p>

<p><strong>Example 2: Discrimination in Cricket</strong></p>
<p>The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has issued an <strong>apology following a report that revealed systemic discrimination within English cricket.</strong> The report, conducted by the Independent Commission for Equity in Cricket (ICEC), highlighted instances of <strong>racism, sexism, and class-based discrimination within the sport</strong>.</p>
<p>The ECB expressed remorse for failing to <strong>prevent these forms of discrimination and acknowledged the need for significant change</strong>s. The report made 44 recommendations for reform, including <strong>equal pay for male and female international players by 2030</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Ethical values highlighted:</strong> Inclusivity, Equality, Anti-discrimination, Accountability, and Reform and improvement</p>
<p><strong>Example 3: ‘Selflessness’ in Public Life</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Cricketer Tendulkar reported on national duty after his father’s death</li>
<li>Virat Kohli played a match-saving knock for his team after his father’s death</li>
<li>Anil Kumble bowled with a <strong>broken Jaw (2002)</strong> against West Indies. He said, “<strong>At least I can now go home with the thought that I tried my best.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>All these examples highlight the importance of ” <strong>selflessness ” when it comes to ethics in public life/service.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Example 4: Lessons on Emotional Intelligence in Cricket</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Test cricket, unlike most other sports, requires long-term</strong>, targeted behaviour and provides insights into how the <strong>mind experiences time, reward, threat, and anxiety</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding our ABCs (alarm-beliefs-coping)</strong> and managing our mind’s reaction to time is crucial in cricket and life alike. Being emotionally intelligent helps players better their performance and reduce anxiety.</p>
<p><strong>Values extracted:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Self-awareness</strong> (recognizing and understanding one’s own emotions)</li>
<li><strong>Self-regulation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Building resilience</strong> to anxiety through cognitive reattribution training (CRT);</li>
<li><strong>Being flexible and adaptable</strong> in response to changing circumstances, and developing strategies to cope with anxiety and negative emotions</li>
<li><strong>Recognizing how anxiety can elongate the perception of time</strong> and impact sleep, diet, and emotional stability, and managing it effectively.</li>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-edit-page/bad-billions-bff-socialism-data-across-developed-and-developing-countries-shows-how-socialist-tendencies-can-backfire-concentrating-rather-than-spreading-wealth-and-favouring-inheritors-ov/"><strong>TOI</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The article discusses <strong>how socialist tendencies</strong> can have <strong>unintended consequences</strong>, concentrating wealth rather than spreading it and favouring <strong>inheritors over entrepreneurs.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is Socialism?</strong></p>
<p>Socialism is an <strong>economic and political ideology</strong> that advocates for the <strong>collective ownership</strong> and control of resources, means of production, and wealth distribution. It aims to create a <strong>more equitable society by reducing inequality, promoting social welfare</strong>, and ensuring that resources are allocated based on societal needs rather than individual profit.</p>
<p><strong>Issues:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Countries with deep socialist roots, including France, Sweden, Russia, and India</strong>, are among those <strong>where the risk of protests against billionaires is high</strong>. This highlights the paradox that <strong>socialist-leaning countries can still experience a concentration of wealth</strong> and dissatisfaction with perceived inequality.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p><strong>France is a country vulnerable to anti-rich populist revolts</strong> due to the rapid rise of billionaire wealth, particularly in family firms like <strong>LVMH</strong>. Recent protests in France targeted billionaires, including LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault, who has become a symbol of the <strong>perceived wealth disparity.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Usage: The example can be used in Social Justice, Indian Society, PSIR and Sociology Paper</strong></p>
