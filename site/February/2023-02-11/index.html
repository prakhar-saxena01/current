<h4 id="gs-paper-1"><strong>GS Paper 1</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Modern Indian History from about the middle of the eighteenth century until the present- significant events, personalities, issues</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/treaty-of-alinagar-bengal-east-india-company-colonial-rule-significance-explained-8436147/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Treaty of Alinagar strengthened the position of the British in Bengal and laid foundations for the Battle of Plassey a few months later.</p>
<ul>
<li>The treaty was the prelude to the <strong>British seizure of Bengal</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Treaty of Alinagar:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It was signed on <strong>9 February 1757</strong> between the British East India Company (<strong>Robert Clive</strong>) and the Nawab of Bengal (<strong>Siraj ud-Daulah</strong>).</li>
<li><strong>Alinagar</strong> was the short-lived name given to Calcutta by the Nawab after it was captured by him.</li>
<li>Although the Nawab had taken control of the English fort in Calcutta, he signed the pact in response to the <strong>English military might and the threat posed by Afghans</strong> (under Ahmad Shah Abdali).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Terms of the treaty:</strong> The Nawab would recognize all the provisions of <strong>Mughal Emperor Farrukhsiyar’s farman of 1717</strong> – exempt from paying duties on goods passed through Bengal, can fortify Calcutta, mint coins in Calcutta, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Significance of the treaty:</strong>  The signing of the treaty was one of the events leading up to the famous Battle of Plassey, which set the stage for <strong>British colonial expansion in India</strong>.</p>
<p>Timeline of the initial phase of British Imperialism in India:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1600</strong> – The English East India Company was formed by a royal charter – A monopoly of all trade from England in the East.</li>
<li><strong>1613</strong> – A royal Farman from Mughal emperor <strong>Jehangir</strong> allowed the Company to open its factories and warehouses.<ul>
<li><strong>T</strong>he Company worked <strong>subservient</strong> to local rulers and established a thriving business.</li>
<li>The three primary trading towns where the British trade thrived were <strong>Bombay, Madras, and Calcutta</strong> (which account for 60% of all English imports from Asia).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>After 1707 (the death of Aurangzeb)</strong> – The Mughal emperor remained the symbolic head, however, his actual power was fast diminishing.</li>
<li><strong>1717</strong> – The Mughal emperor Farrukhsiyar’s farman gave favourable terms to the Company to trade in Bengal, this was met with local opposition.</li>
<li><strong>1717 -1727</strong> – Nawab Murshid Quli Khan, the new autonomous ruler of Bengal, refused to extend the 1917 farmaan.</li>
<li><strong>1755</strong> – Worried about French competition, the English began renovating the fortifications in Calcutta without Nawab’s permission.</li>
<li><strong>1756</strong> – Nawab Siraj ud Daula’s forces captured <strong>Fort William</strong>, Calcutta, and renamed it Alinagar.</li>
<li><strong>February 9, 1757:</strong> Treaty of Alinagar – the eventual rise of the East India Company as a political force to be reckoned with.</li>
<li><strong>June 23, 1757</strong> – Battle of Plassey. The Company began territorial control that would serve its economic interests.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Status of India with respect to these critical mineral resources</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>India imports almost all</strong> of its need for rare earth metals and of lithium, Cobalt (mostly from China)</li>
<li><strong>India’s demand</strong> for these critical resources has <strong>risen 6 fold</strong> in the last five years as it tries to be the electronic and solar manufacturing hub</li>
<li><strong>Recently, India’s first-ever Lithium deposit site was found in the</strong> igneous rocks located in the <strong>Marlagalla-Allapatna region</strong> of <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/02/04/lithium-deposits-in-mandya-district-of-karnataka/">Southern Karnataka’s Mandya district.</a></li>
<li>The thermonuclear application makes Lithium a “<strong>Prescribed substance</strong>” under <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2014/10/27/indias-energy-security-nuclear-power-sector/"><strong>the Atomic Energy Act, of 1962</strong></a> which permits AMD to the exploration of Lithium in various geological domains of the country</li>

<li>According to the <strong>Global E-waste Monitor 2020</strong>, the world dumped 53.6 million metric tons of e-waste in 2019<strong>. India produced 3.2 million metric tons</strong> of e-waste, much of which is dumped for dismantling and recycling in Seelampur with no regulations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About e-waste:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The term electronic and electrical waste (e-waste) refers to “<strong>electrical or electronic equipment, which is waste, including all components, subassemblies, and consumables, which are part of the equipment at the time the equipment becomes waste</strong> ”.</li>
<li>E-waste includes large, discarded appliances, such as <strong>refrigerators, air conditioners, and washing machines, as well as small personal items, including computers, televisions, mobile phones, and many other devices that are operated by electrical currents or batteries.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/toxic_1.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/toxic_1.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>What health risks are the children exposed to?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Toxic substances</strong>: Toxic substances such as <strong>lead, cadmium, mercury, and flame retardants, can be harmfu</strong>l if not properly disposed of. <strong>Serious skin diseases and chronic lung infections</strong> due to continuous exposure to these chemical-laden toxins.</li>
<li><strong>Disabilities</strong>: Even relatively <strong>low lead exposure in children</strong> can result in a <strong>reduction in total intelligence quotient (IQ) and several behavioural abnormalities</strong>, including a decrease in attention span and an increase in frustration and disruptive behaviour.</li>
<li><strong>Exposure to hazardous waste:</strong> Like Nickel, Mercury can cause long-term incurable diseases.</li>
<li><strong>Environmental contamination</strong>: Contaminated soil and water potentially affect the health of local populations, including children.</li>
<li><strong>Loss of access to educational opportunities</strong>: In some developing countries, e-waste dumping has caused environmental degradation and health problems, <strong>leading to school closures and limiting children’s access to education.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>India’s initiatives to tackle e-waste:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Extended Producer Responsibility; Design for Environment; (3Rs) Reduce, Reuse, Recycle technology platform</strong> for linking the market facilitating the <strong>circular economy</strong> aim to encourage consumers to <strong>correctly dispose of the e-waste.</strong></li>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/11/11/government-notified-e-waste-management-rules-2022/">E-waste (Management) rules 2022</a></li>
<li>India has tried to tackle this unregulated industry and <strong>introduced a series of laws in 2011 and 2016</strong> <strong>mandating the authorization and registration of all e-waste recycling facilities</strong>, along with directives for workers to use protective equipment while dismantling the waste.</li>
<li>India’s first e-waste clinic to be set up in Bhopal</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way Forward:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recycling electronic devices through certified e-waste recycling programs</strong> or donating them to organizations that can reuse them can help reduce the issue of e-waste.</p>
