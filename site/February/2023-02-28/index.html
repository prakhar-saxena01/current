<p><strong>Context</strong>:  An intensive study of <strong>Earth’s deep interior</strong>, based on the <strong>behaviour of</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/world-geography/physical-geography-of-the-world/geomorphology/internal-forces-their-impact/earthquakes/earthquake-waves/">seismic waves</a> from large <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/world-geography/physical-geography-of-the-world/geomorphology/internal-forces-their-impact/earthquakes/earthquake-waves/">earthquakes</a>, confirmed the existence of a <strong>distinct structure inside our planet’s inner core</strong> – <strong>a hot innermost solid ball of iron and nickel about 800 miles (1,350 km) wide.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/world-geography/physical-geography-of-the-world/geomorphology/interior-structure-of-the-earth/layers-of-the-earth/">Layers of the Earth:</a></p>
<ul>
<li>The planet’s internal structure comprises four layers: <strong>a rocky crust on the outside, then a rocky mantle, an outer core made of magma, and a solid inner core.</strong></li>
<li>The inner core’s outer shell and its newly confirmed innermost sphere both are hot enough to be molten but are a <strong>solid iron-nickel alloy because the incredible pressure at the centre of the Earth renders it a solid state.</strong></li>
<li>The inner core is <strong>slowly growing in size at the expense of the outer core</strong> by solidifying molten materials as Earth gradually cools.</li>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: According to a new study, <strong>the mantle — a 2,900 km thick layer of solid rock</strong> sandwiched between the <strong>Earth’s upper crust and lower core</strong> — <strong>has been hiding two layers</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>One is the “<strong>low viscosity” zone</strong> in the upper mantle.</li>
<li>The other layer is the <strong>low-velocity zone, which is also a part of the upper mantle</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance of this layer:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Affects how Earth <strong>transports heat and mixes materials</strong> between the crust, core, and mantle over time.</li>
<li>The mantle’s <strong>viscous properties govern convection — the transfer of heat between areas of different temperature</strong>s, enabling plate tectonics.</li>
<li>The viscosity of the rocks in the transition zone between the upper and the lower mantle determines whether a <strong>plate sinks below another one (subduction) through</strong></li>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240068759"><strong>WHO</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Every day in 2020, approximately 800 women died (a woman every two minutes) globally from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3</strong> (target 3.1) is <strong>to reduce maternal mortality to less than 70 deaths per 100 000 live births by 2030.</strong></li>
<li>The report has been published by the United Nations Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-Agency Group (<strong>MMEIG</strong>) – comprising WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, the WB Group and the UNDESA/Population Division has collaborated on a new round of estimates (2000 to 2020).</li>
<li>The report presents <strong>global, regional and country-level estimates</strong> and trends for maternal mortality (between 2000-2020).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>India</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As per the Sample Registration System (SRS) report by the Registrar General of India (RGI), the <strong>Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) of India</strong> has <strong>reduced</strong> from 130 per 100,000 live births in 2014-16 to <strong>113 per 100,000 live births</strong> in 2016-18.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The global MMR in 2020 was estimated at <strong>223</strong> maternal deaths per 100 000 live births, down from 227 in 2015 and 339 in 2000 – a reduction of one-third (34.3%) over the full 20-year period.</li>
<li>Three countries had more than 10 000 maternal deaths in 2020:<ul>
<li><strong>India</strong> (24 000)</li>
<li>DR Congo (22 000)</li>
<li>Ethiopia (10 000)</li>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: The Supreme Court <strong>refused to entertain a PIL about menstrual leave for workers</strong> and students across the country, calling it a policy matter.</p>
<p><strong>About Menstrual leave/period leave:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Menstrual leave refers to <strong>all policies that allow employees or students to take time off</strong> <strong>when they are experiencing menstrual pain or discomfort</strong>. In the context of the workplace, it refers to policies that allow for both <strong>paid or unpaid leave, or time for rest.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples from India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Zomato in 2020,</strong> announced a <strong>10-day paid period of leave per year</strong>, and <strong>Swiggy and Byjus have also followed suit.</strong></li>
<li>Among State governments, <strong>Bihar and Kerala are the only ones to introduce menstrual leave to women.</strong></li>
<li>The Bihar government, then headed by <strong>Lalu Prasad Yadav, introduced its menstrual leave policy in 1992</strong>, allowing employees <strong>two days of paid menstrual leave every month.</strong></li>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/24/kerala-announces-menstrual-leave-time-to-talk-period/">Kerala</a> <strong>announced that the State’s Higher</strong> <strong>Education department grants menstrual and maternity leaves for students in universities that function under the department</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Global Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spain became the first European country</strong> to grant paid menstrual leave to workers, among a host of other <strong>sexual health rights</strong>.</li>
<li>Japan introduced <strong>menstrual leave as part of labour law in 1947</strong> after the idea became popular with labour unions in the 1920s. At present, under <strong>Article 68, employers cannot ask women who experience difficult periods to work during that time.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Indonesia introduced a policy in 1948, amended in 2003</strong>, saying that workers experiencing menstrual pain are not obliged to work on the first two days of their cycle.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Philippines</strong>, workers are permitted two days of menstrual leave a month.</li>
<li><strong>Taiwan</strong> has an Act of <strong>Gender Equality in Employment in place.</strong> Under Article 14 of the Act, employees have the <strong>right to request a day off as period leave every month, at half their regular wage.</strong></li>
<li>South Korea takes a slightly different route, allowing for <strong>monthly physiologic leave under Article 73 of their labour law, allowing all female workers to get a day off every month</strong>.</li>
<li>Among the African nations, <strong>Zambia introduced one day of leave a month without needing a reason or a medical certificate, calling it Mother’s Day.</strong></li>
<li>Companies across nations, such as <strong>Nike and Coexist, have introduced menstrual leave as an internal policy.</strong></li>

<p><strong>Context: Individual Forest Rights (IFR),</strong> without which forest dwellers stand to be evicted from their native habitations, have been awarded to very few applicants across the country.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/09/16/the-scheduled-tribes-and-other-traditional-forest-dwellers-recognition-of-rights-act/">The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act 2006 (FRA</a><strong>)</strong>, recognizes the rights of the forest-dwelling communities to forest resources.</li>
<li>The Act encompasses –<ul>
<li><strong>Individual rights:</strong> Rights of Self-cultivation and Habitation</li>
<li><strong>Community Rights</strong>: Grazing, Fishing and access to Water bodies in forests, access to biodiversity, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It also provides <strong>rights to the allocation of forest land for developmental purposes</strong> to fulfil the basic infrastructural needs of the community.</li>
<li>In conjunction with the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/09/29/right-to-fair-compensation-and-transparency-in-land-acquisition-rehabilitation-and-resettlement-act-2013/">Land Acquisition Rehabilitation and Settlement Act 2013</a>, <strong>FRA protects the tribal population from eviction</strong> without rehabilitation and settlement.</li>
<li><strong>The Gram Sabha</strong> is a highly empowered body under the Act, enabling the tribal population to have a decisive say in the determination of local policies and schemes impacting them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The procedure for granting the IFR:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Gram Sabha → sub-divisional-level committee (SDLC) → district-level committee (DLC)</li>
<li><strong>The Forest Rights Committee</strong> (FRC) is elected from Gram Sabhas in order to assist a Gram Sabha in the process of vesting the rights/reviewing the decision of the above committees.</li>
<li>As per the FRA, <strong>IFR claims cannot be rejected because of a lack of documents.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/12/29/insights-into-editorial-looking-beyond-the-forest-rights-act/#:~:text=The%20Scheduled%20Tribes%20and%20Other,right%20to%20life%20and%20livelihood.">High rate of IFR claim rejection</a><strong>.</strong> According to the MoTA, <strong>almost half</strong> the IFR applications that were previously rejected and sent for review were rejected once again.</li>
<li>In 2019, the SC directed the states to evict (1,191,273 tribals across 20 states) those FRA claimants whose IFR claims were rejected.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The SC (in 2019), while staying its eviction order asked states:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To supply information on the number of rejections,</li>
<li>Procedure followed,</li>
<li>Reasons for rejection and</li>
<li>If the tribals had been given the chance to produce evidence before the rejection of claims.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Conservation, Environmental Pollution and Degradation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/unpacking-the-new-set-of-e-waste-rules/article66560850.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> In a time of increased urbanisation, digitalisation and population growth, the problem of <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/environment-pollution-and-control/waste-management/e-waste/">managing e-waste</a> is an ongoing challenge.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The first set of <strong>e-waste Rules</strong> (2011) introduced <strong>Extended Producer Responsibility</strong> (EPR) – which made ‘producers’ responsible for the safe disposal of e-waste once the consumer discards them.</li>
<li><strong>E-waste rules 2016</strong> (amended in 2018) included provisions to promote <strong>‘authorisation’</strong> and <strong>‘product stewardship’</strong>, stakeholders such as the ‘<strong>Producer Responsibility Organisations</strong>’ (PRO) were also introduced in these rules.<ul>
<li>PROs acted as an <strong>intermediary</strong> between producers (bidding for contracts) and formal recyclers (arranging for ‘certified and authorised’ recycling).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The MoEFCC notified a new set of e-waste rules – <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/11/11/government-notified-e-waste-management-rules-2022/">E-Waste (Management) Rules 2022.</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/disposing.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/disposing.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Key provisions of the E-Waste (Management) Rules 2022:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike the earlier rules (seeking authorisation by stakeholders), the new rules provide for the <strong>‘Registration of Stakeholders’</strong> (manufacturer/producer/refurbisher/recycler).</li>
<li>A ‘<strong>digitalised systems approach</strong>’ may now standardise the e-waste value chain through a common digital ‘portal’.</li>
<li>The above provisions <strong>will reduce the frequency of ‘false trail’</strong> – falsely revealing 100% collection on paper while collecting/weighing ‘scrap’ to meet targets.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/08/01/new-e-waste-rules-threaten-jobs/">Issues with the 2022 rules</a><strong>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Weak monitoring system</strong> and a <strong>lack of transparency</strong>. <strong>For example,</strong> many recyclers undertake activities only up to the pre-processing/segregation stage and channelise e-waste to the informal sector, which is a pure violation of the law.</li>
<li>Two important stages of efficient e-waste recycling – <strong>component recovery and residual disposal</strong> – are briefly touched upon.</li>
<li><strong>It does away with PRO and dismantlers</strong> and vests all the responsibility of recycling with authorised recyclers.</li>
<li><strong>The informal sector</strong>, which plays a crucial role (95% of e-waste is channelised) in e-waste handling, draws no recognition in the new rules.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ensuring the requirement of the <strong>recovery tangent.</strong></li>
<li>The activities of the recyclers must be recorded → tracing the quantity of <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/10/19/international-e-waste-day/">e-waste</a> that went for recycling.</li>
<li><strong>A robust collection and</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/05/25/60-e-waste-recycling-likely-by-2023/">recycling</a> <strong>system</strong> on the ground.</li>
<li>Stakeholders <strong>must have the right information and intent</strong> to safely dispose of e-waste.</li>
<li>There is a need for <strong>increased consumer awareness</strong>, strengthening reverse logistics, building capacity, improving existing infrastructure, adopting green procurement practices, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best practice:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>‘Karo Sambhav’</strong>, a Delhi-based PRO, has integrated informal aggregators in its collection mechanism → e-waste entered a safe and structured system → informal sector has an advantage in terms of financial and legal security.</li>
<li><strong>IIT Hyderabad</strong> launched M.Tech courses in e-Waste Resources.</li>

<p>Engineers are developing <strong>CO2-infused concrete</strong> that <strong>sequesters greenhouse gases</strong> and is stronger, and even <strong>bendable</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the USA, states like New York and New Jersey are promoting policies for use of such concretes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Issues with Concrete:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cement production accounts for <strong>7% of global carbon dioxide emissions.</strong></li>
<li>Concrete is one of the <strong>most-used resources on Earth, with an estimated 26 billion tons</strong> produced annually worldwide. It has a high carbon footprint.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is Bendable Concrete?</strong></p>
<p>Unlike conventional concrete, bendable concrete can <strong>bend under pressure without rupturing</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bendable concrete makes infrastructure safer, extends its service life and reduces maintenance costs and resource use.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Usage</strong>: This innovative example can be used in Environment/Disaster management paper as a way to sequester carbon as well as make buildings safer from the earthquake.</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: The recent <strong>U.S. Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act 2.0</strong> has approved computer-based and experimental alternatives to animals to test new drugs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Although using animals, as drug testbeds, will continue</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are Organ-on-a-Chips?</strong></p>
<p>They are <strong>small devices containing human cells</strong> that are used to <strong>mimic the environment in human organs,</strong> including blood flow and breathing movements, serving as synthetic environments in which to test new drugs.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Boost the research and development</strong> of Organ chips</li>
<li><strong>Reduce the cost</strong> of R&amp;D of drugs</li>
<li><strong>Animal models often poorly mimic human diseases</strong>, which has led scientists to develop alternative models</li>
<li><strong>Reduce the chances of contamination</strong> and spread of disease from animals being experimented on.</li>
<li><strong>Organ chips</strong> can be used to <strong>develop personalised therapies</strong> for individual patients</li>
<li><strong>Minimize ethical dilemmas associated</strong> with the use of animals for testing (treatment of animal and their well-being)</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>About the Disease:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) (or simply Mad Cow Disease)</strong> is a degenerative, transmissible, slowly progressive, and fatal infection that affects the central nervous system of adult cattle.</p>
<p><strong>How is it caused?</strong></p>
<p>It is caused by a <strong>protein called a ‘prion’</strong> normally found on the cell surfaces of cattle. However, the normal prion protein changes into an abnormal prion protein and these proteins destroy the nervous system tissue- the brain and spinal cord.</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: The <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2018/12/14/atacama-large-millimeter-array-alma/">Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA)</a> — a radio telescope comprising <strong>66 antennas</strong>— is set to get software and hardware upgrades that will help it collect much more data and produce sharper images than ever before.</p>
<p>ALMA is operated under a partnership among the <strong>United States, 16 countries in Europe, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Chile</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2018/12/14/atacama-large-millimeter-array-alma/">What is ALMA</a><strong>?</strong></p>
<p>ALMA is a <strong>state-of-the-art telescope that studies celestial objects at millimetre and submillimetre</strong> wavelengths — they can <strong>penetrate through dust clouds and help astronomers</strong> examine dim and distant galaxies and stars out there. It also <strong>has extraordinary sensitivity, which allows it to detect even extremely faint radio signals.</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/alma.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/alma.jpg?is-pending-load=1" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Why Chile:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The millimetre and submillimetre waves observed by it are very <strong>susceptible to atmospheric water vapour absorption on Earth</strong>.</li>
<li>The desert is the <strong>driest place in the world, meaning most of the nights here are clear of</strong> clouds and free of light-distorting moisture — making it a perfect location for examining the universe.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are some of the notable discoveries made by ALMA?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One of the earliest findings came in 2013 when it discovered <strong>starburst galaxies earlier in the universe’s history than they were previously thought to have existed.</strong></li>
<li>ALMA provided <strong>detailed images of the protoplanetary disc surrounding HL Tauri — a very young T Tauri</strong> star in the constellation <strong>Taurus</strong>, approximately 450 light years from Earth</li>
<li>In 2015, the telescope helped scientists observe a phenomenon known as <strong>the</strong> <a href="https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/2005/32/1788-Image.html">Einstein ring</a><strong>, which occurs when light from a galaxy or star passes by a massive object en route to the Earth</strong>, in extraordinary detail.</li>
