<p><strong>Context</strong>: Three <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/world-geography/physical-geography-of-the-world/geomorphology/internal-forces-their-impact/earthquakes/">earthquake</a>s measuring — <strong>7.8, 7.6, and 6.0</strong> — magnitude on the <strong>Richter scale have devastated Turkey and Syria,</strong> while impacting regions as far away as Cyprus, Lebanon, Israel, and Egypt.</p>
<p><strong>Turkey</strong> has announced a <strong>Level 4 alert calling for international aid</strong>; U.S., European Union, Russia, and Azerbaijan have reportedly dispatched aid.</p>
<p><strong>Why is Turkey prone to</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/world-geography/physical-geography-of-the-world/geomorphology/internal-forces-their-impact/earthquakes/"><strong>Earthquakes</strong></a><strong>?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In the region of <strong>Turkey, Syria, and Jordan</strong>, <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/world-geography/physical-geography-of-the-world/geomorphology/first-order/">tectonics</a> are dominated by complex interactions between the <strong>African, Arabian, and Eurasian tectonic plates, and the Anatolian tectonic block.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Other factors:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Red Sea Rift</strong>, the spreading centre between the African and Arabian plates;</li>
<li><strong>Dead Sea Transform</strong>, a major strike-slip fault that also accommodates Africa-Arabia relative motions;</li>
<li><strong>North Anatolia Fault</strong>, a right-lateral strike-slip structure in northern Turkey accommodating much of the translational motion of the Anatolia block westwards with respect to Eurasia and Africa;</li>
<li><strong>Cyprian Arc,</strong> a convergent boundary between the African plate and the Anatolia block.</li>

<p><strong>What are aftershocks and why do they occur?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Aftershocks are a <strong>sequence of earthquakes that happen after a larger main shock on a fault</strong>. They occur near the fault zone where the main shock rupture occurred and are part of the “readjustment process” after the main slip on the fault.</li>
<li>While they become less frequent with time, they can continue for days, weeks, months, or even years for a very large main shock.</li>

<p><strong>Direction:</strong>  This is from ‘The Hindu Podcast’, it discusses the advantages and disadvantages of India becoming the world’s most populous nation in 2023.</p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> 2023 is set to be a landmark year for India’s <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/society/population-and-associated-issues/">population</a> trajectory, as the country is predicted to overtake China to become the world’s most populous nation.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>

<li>According to the <strong>UN World Population Prospects 2022</strong>, India is projected to <strong>overtake China</strong> as the world’s most populous country in</li>
<li>India’s population stands at <strong>412 billion in 2022</strong> and is projected to have a population of 1.668 billion in 2050.</li>
<li>India is expected to reach <strong>1,428.6 million in 2023</strong>. On the other hand, China’s population fell to 1,411.8 million in 2022 (from 1,412.6 million in 2021).</li>

<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>

<li>India must shift its lens from ‘population control’ to <strong>‘</strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/08/14/editorial-analysismoving-policy-away-from-population-control/"><strong>population development</strong></a><strong>’.</strong></li>
<li>For this, India must frame policies and strategies to effectively unleash the full potential of its young people.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Data from the Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MoTA) revealed that the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST) is currently functioning with <strong>less than 50% of its sanctioned strength</strong></p>
<p><strong>Issues with the staffing in the commission:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The sanctioned strength of the ST panel is</strong> one Chairperson+ one Vice-Chairperson+ three Members= <strong>total of Five members</strong> (two among V-C and Members must be from the ST community and one member must be a woman).<ul>
<li>However, currently, it just has a <strong>Chairperson</strong> (Harsh Chouhan) and <strong>one Member</strong> (Ananta Nayak) with all other positions, including that of the mandatory ST Member, vacant for the <strong>last three years</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Posts under Group A, B and C:</strong> Against total sanctioned posts of 124; 70 posts are vacant<ul>
<li><strong>Among the group A posts:</strong> Sanctioned posts of one Superintendent of Police, one Law Officer and one Accounts Officer are vacant since 2004.<ul>
<li><strong>While Group A posts in the NCST</strong> are filled by the Ministry, Groups B and C posts are the NCST’s responsibility</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The recruitment rules</strong> for the posts are yet to be framed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Posts of Research Officers</strong>, Investigators and Directors are vacant</li>
<li><strong>Lack of applicants</strong>: The Ministry claimed that the <strong>eligibility bar</strong> was set too high for the entry of applicants</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other concerns:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fewer meetings:</strong> In the financial year 2021-22, it has met only four times.</li>
<li><strong>High rate of pendency of cases</strong>: Its rate of pendency of resolution of complaints and cases that it receives is also close to 50%</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About NCST:</strong></p>
<p>NCST is a constitutional body set up by amending <strong>Article 338</strong> and by inserting a new article 338A in the Constitution (89th Constitution Amendment Act, 2003) in 2004.</p>
<p>Erstwhile <strong>National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes</strong> was replaced by <strong>two separate Commissions namely:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC)</li>
<li>The National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST)</li>

<p><strong>Direction:</strong> The article highlights the drug menace in India, its impact and steps taken by the government of India.</p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> In 2022, Kerala saw a high increase in cases involving drugs, liquor, and prohibited tobacco items, suggesting that drugs have become a new problem for the state.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Data show that the police registered 26,629 cases under the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/12/07/ndps-bill-2021/">Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act</a> in 2022 – <strong>a jump of over 300%</strong> when compared to 2016.</li>
<li>While there was a fall in the quantity of ganja seized in 2022 over the previous year, seizures of <strong>heroin, charas and hashish</strong> have gone up.</li>
<li><strong>Bengaluru and Goa remain</strong> major hubs from where the drugs are sourced and <strong>cannabis</strong> is the main drug used by teenagers.</li>
<li>The steady rise in drug-related cases in Kerala is <strong>a factor of both strict enforcement and raids and easier access to contraband</strong>.</li>
<li>Youngsters are now aware of the availability of synthetic/recreational drugs (MDMA and LSD). There is also <strong>peer pressure</strong> to explore these drugs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scale of the Drug Addiction problem in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The UNODC’s <strong>World Drug Report 2022</strong> estimates that around <strong>284 million people use drugs worldwide</strong>.</li>
<li>The report also claims <strong>India is one of the world’s single-largest opiate markets</strong> and most addicts are between the <strong>age group of 15 and 35</strong> and many are <strong>unemployed</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>More than 60%</strong> of all illicit drugs seized in India are from <strong>Punjab</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/heroin.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/heroin.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Impact on individual, economy, society and national security:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Drug addiction poses a <strong>high risk of unintentional injuries, accidents, domestic violence incidents</strong>, medical problems and death.</li>
<li><strong>Impacts on Mental Health:</strong> Drug dependence leads to low self-esteem, and hopelessness and can lead to <strong>criminal activities</strong>/law and order challenges and even <strong>suicidal tendencies</strong>.</li>
<li>Drug abusers’ <strong>economic potential gets severely impacted</strong>. <strong>For example</strong>, they fail to become part of the workforce.</li>
<li><strong>Money earned from the illegal drug trade</strong> is used to aid terrorist organisations, which <strong>threatens the defence and security</strong> of many countries.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Measures taken by the government:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The NDPS Act, 1985</strong>: Under the act, the <strong>Narcotics Control Bureau</strong> (NCB) was constituted in 1986 with the prime responsibility of <strong>fighting drug trafficking and drug abuse</strong>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/06/29/nasha-mukt-bharat-annual-action-plan-2020-21/"><strong>Nasha Mukt Bharat Abhiyaan (NMBA)</strong></a><strong>:</strong> In 2020, the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment launched NMBA in 272 most vulnerable districts of India to address the problem.</li>
<li>The MoSJ&amp;E has begun the implementation of a <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/01/17/national-action-plan-for-drug-demand-reduction-2018-2023/">National Action Plan for Drug Demand Reduction</a> (<strong>NAPDDR</strong>) for 2018-2025.</li>
<li>The government constituted the Narco-Coordination Centre (<strong>NCORD</strong>) in 2016.</li>
<li>The government has constituted a fund called the “<a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/10/25/national-fund-to-control-drug-abuse/"><strong>National Fund for Control of Drug Abuse</strong></a>” to meet the expenditure incurred in combating illicit traffic in Narcotic Drugs, rehabilitating addicts, educating the public against drug abuse, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best Practice:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>The Portuguese model:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In 2001, <strong>Portugal became the first country in the world</strong> to decriminalise the possession and use of all illegal drugs.</li>
<li>Instead of sending people to court for drug possession, its model focuses on <strong>education, treatment and harm reduction.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Operation “Gear Box”</strong> was started by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) to combat the smuggling of heroin by detecting the hidden drugs in the gearboxes.</p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-3"><strong>GS Paper 3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Conservation, environmental pollution and degradation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/water/long-term-groundwater-storage-in-ganga-basin-declining-at-2-6-cm-per-year-study-87492"><strong>DTE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Direction:</strong> The article highlights that groundwater in the Ganga basin has been declining. The article includes a best practice (infographics) of groundwater conservation in India.</p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>According to new estimates, <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/04/06/insights-into-editorial-making-groundwater-visible/">groundwater</a> storage levels have been <strong>declining by 2.6 centimetres per year</strong> in the Ganga basin.</li>
<li>The impacts were more pronounced in <strong>Rajasthan, Haryana and Delhi</strong>, with average storage declines of roughly 14 cm/year, 1, 7.5 cm/year and 7.2 cm year−1, respectively.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ganga.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ganga.jpg?is-pending-load=1" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A recent <strong>Central Groundwater Board yearbook</strong>, which monitors groundwater levels four times a year, found that the water levels in 2021-2022 rose compared to the 2011-2020 average.</li>
<li><strong>The Brahmaputra basin</strong>, which was not a part of the study, shows more groundwater level reduction than the Ganga and Indus basins.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Findings of the study:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Ganga Basin’s <strong>aquifers are one of the largest reservoirs of groundwater</strong> in the world.</li>
<li>Researchers <strong>used three different methods</strong> to study long-term groundwater storage across six states.<ul>
<li>Data between 1996 and 2017 from the <strong>Central Groundwater Board.</strong></li>
<li>Data from the <strong>Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE)</strong> – satellites launched in 2002 to assess Earth’s water reservoirs over land, ice and ocean.</li>
<li>A model to study <strong>groundwater dynamics and storage</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All three analyses depicted that groundwater in the Ganga basin is declining. The new study included western <strong>Delhi, Haryana and Rajasthan under the Ganga basin.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Rajasthan</strong>, whose groundwater reserves contribute about 90% of the drinking water and 60% of the irrigation, <strong>is showing an improvement in groundwater levels in the recent past.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impacted Regions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Agriculturally intensive regions and urban areas</strong> (like Delhi and Agra) took the biggest hit.</li>
<li><strong>Delhi and Haryana</strong> have high groundwater abstraction rates (<strong>Groundwater abstraction</strong> refers to the process of removing water from underground aquifers for various purposes such as irrigation, drinking water supply, industrial use, or for recharging depleted aquifers.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reasons highlighted by the WMO’s – first State of Global Water Resources 2021:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The worsening impact of climate change/global warming</strong> – more water flowing in the river channels due to glacial melt, however, <strong>total water storage declined in 2021.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Over-abstraction</strong> of groundwater for irrigation.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Rajasthan Model of Open Prison</strong>: The open prison model adopted in Rajasthan, with convicts staying on community land without high walls or strict surveillance, has promoted a <strong>reformative form of punishment</strong> and succeeded in transforming the lives of inmates.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reformative form of punishment:</strong> It is premised on the humane concept that a wrongdoer does not simply cease to be a living human being just because he commits crimes. In contrast, Retributive justice focuses on punishing an offender</li>
<li><strong>Lower expenses</strong>: As minimum security facilities, the open prisons need 92% less staff than closed jails, and incur monthly costs of only ₹500 per prisoner; no reports of prisoner escapes or repeat offences</li>
<li>Rajasthan has now proved the concept with <strong>40 such open camps</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, open prisons can offer a <strong>more ethical approach to imprisonment</strong> by promoting rehabilitation, reducing overcrowding, improving human rights, and potentially reducing costs.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Markets regulator Sebi has strengthened the <strong>framework for</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/02/07/green-bonds-4/"><strong>green bonds</strong></a> (green debt securities) by introducing the concept of ‘blue’ and ‘yellow’ bonds as new modes of sustainable finance.</p>
<p><strong>What are Green debt securities?</strong></p>
<p>Sebi broadly defines green debt security as one that is issued for the purpose of raising capital to be used for the cause of sustainable development or furthering energy efficiency</p>
<p><strong>Under the sub-categories of green debt securities:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blue bonds</strong>: It is a debt instrument issued by governments, development banks or others to raise capital to finance <strong>marine and ocean-based projects</strong> that have positive environmental, economic and climate benefits</li>
<li><strong>Yellow</strong> bonds pertain to solar energy</li>
<li><strong>Transition</strong> bonds: To fund a firm’s transition or to reduce their carbon emissions</li>
</ul>
<p>These measures have been taken to align India’s framework for green debt securities with the updated <strong>Green Bond Principles (GBP</strong>) recognised by IOSCO. </p>
<p><strong>About IOSCO:</strong></p>
<p>The International Organization of Securities Commissions <strong>(Est. 1983, HQ: Madrid (Spain))</strong> is an association of organizations that regulate the world’s securities and futures markets. SEBI is a member of it.</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: Jointly <strong>developed by NASA and the ISRO</strong>, an Earth-observation satellite, called <strong>NISAR (NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar</strong>), got a send-off ceremony at the <strong>American space agency’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/science-technology/space-technology/nisar/"><strong>NISAR</strong></a><strong>?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The satellite consists of <strong>both L-band and S-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR)</strong> instruments, which makes <strong>it a dual-frequency imaging radar satellite.</strong></li>
<li>While <strong>NASA has provided the L-band radar, GPS, a high-capacity solid-state recorder to store data, and a payload data subsystem, ISRO has provided the S-band radar, the GSLV launch system, and spacecraft</strong>.</li>
<li>It has a large <strong>39-foot stationary antenna reflector</strong> made of a <strong>gold-plated wire mesh</strong>, the reflector will be used to focus “<strong>the radar signals emitted and received by the upward-facing feed on the instrument structur</strong>e”.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Petrol blended with 20% ethanol was rolled out at select petrol pumps in 11 states and UTs as part of a programme to increase the use of <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/science-technology/biotechnology/biofuels/">biofuels</a> to cut emissions as well as dependence on foreign exchange-draining imports.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>At present, 10% ethanol</strong> is blended in petrol (10% ethanol, 90% petrol) and the government is looking to <strong>double this quantity by 2025</strong> (advanced by 5 years).</li>
<li>Ethanol blending in petrol increased from <strong>5%</strong> (in 2014) to 10% and is now progressing towards 20% blending.</li>
<li>The PM launched the higher 20% <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/science-technology/biotechnology/ethanol-blending-programme-in-india/">ethanol-blended petrol</a> (E20) at the <strong>India Energy Week (IEW) 2023</strong>, two months ahead of the planned rollout.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance of rolling out E20:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>India currently is <strong>85%</strong> (the world’s third-largest oil consumer and importer) <strong>dependent on imports</strong> for meeting its oil needs.</li>
<li>The use of ethanol will <strong>cut its imports and save forex.</strong> India spent USD 120.7 billion on the import of crude oil in the 2021-22 fiscal. In the current fiscal, USD 125 billion have been spent in the first nine months (April to December) alone.</li>
<li>The use of ethanol, extracted from sugarcane as well as broken rice and other agri produce, will also be a boost to</li>
<li><strong>Also, it cuts carbon emissions.</strong> Estimated reduction of CO emissions by about 50% in 2-wheelers and about 30% in 4-wheelers compared to E0.</li>
