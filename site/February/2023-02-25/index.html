<h4 id="gs-paper-1"><strong>GS Paper 1</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Post-independence consolidation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/amritpal-singh-khalistan-movement-punjab-history-8465056/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Hundreds of followers of a radical preacher and <strong>pro-Khalistan leader</strong> (Amritpal Singh) clashed violently with police near Amritsar, demanding the release of one of their colleagues.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Amritpal Singh is a follower of the slain Sikh militant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, and took the reins of the ‘<strong>Waris Punjab De</strong>’ organisation following the death of its founder (Deep Sidhu).</p>
<p><strong>What is the Khalistan movement?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is <strong>a Sikh separatist movement</strong> seeking to create a homeland for Sikhs by establishing a sovereign state, called Khalistan (‘Land of the Khalsa’), in the Punjab region.</li>
<li>Its origins have been traced back to <strong>India’s independence and subsequent Partition along religious lines</strong>.<ul>
<li><strong>The Punjab province</strong>, which was divided between India and Pakistan, witnessed communal violence and generated millions of refugees.</li>
<li>The historic Sikh Empire’s capital, <strong>Lahore</strong>, as well as sacred Sikh sites like Nankana Sahib, the birthplace of Guru Nanak, went to Pakistan.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>While most Sikhs found themselves in India, they were a small minority (2% of the population) in the country.</li>
<li>The political struggle for greater autonomy began with the <strong>Punjabi Suba Movement</strong> for the creation of a Punjabi-speaking state.</li>
<li><strong>The States Reorganisation Commission report (1955)</strong> rejected this demand, but the state of Punjab was reorganised (<strong>trifurcated</strong> into the Hindi-Hindu-majority HP and Haryana, and Punjabi-Sikh-majority Punjab) in <strong>1966</strong>.</li>
<li>The Punjabi Suba movement had galvanised the Akali Dal, which concluded the <strong>Anandpur Sahib Resolution</strong> (1973) demanding autonomy (not secession from India) for the state of Punjab.</li>
<li>This demand had gone global by <strong>1971</strong> – when an advertisement in The New York Times proclaimed the <strong>birth of Khalistan.</strong></li>
<li>By the 1980s, the appeal of <strong>Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale</strong> had started creating trouble for the government.</li>
<li>He and his followers (mostly from the lower rungs of the social ladder) were getting increasingly violent.</li>
<li>In 1982, with support from the Akali Dal’s leadership, he launched a civil disobedience movement called the <strong>Dharam Yudh Morcha</strong> and took up residence inside the Golden Temple, directing demonstrations and clashes with the police.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/scarred-1.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/scarred-1.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What was Operation Blue Star?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Khalistan movement was crushed in India following <strong>Operation Blue Star</strong> (by the Indian Army to flush out militants from the Golden Temple and neutralise Bhindranwale in <strong>1984</strong>) and <strong>Operation Black Thunder</strong> (1986 and 1988).</li>
<li>While the operations were ostensibly successful in their aims, they <strong>gravely wounded</strong> (by the desecration of the Golden Temple) the Sikh community around the world and also <strong>galvanised the demand for Khalistan</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Aftermath of the Operation Blue Star:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>PM <strong>Indira Gandhi</strong> was assassinated (on October 31, 1984), triggering the worst communal violence since Partition.</li>
<li>Punjab became the hub of a <strong>long drawn-out insurgency</strong> (allegedly supported by Pakistan) that lasted till 1995.</li>
<li>The movement <strong>continues to evoke sympathy and support</strong> among sections of the Sikh population, especially in the Sikh diaspora.</li>
<li>Today, the movement is fuelled by <strong>vote bank politics, social issues</strong> (unemployment, <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/06/28/rstv-the-big-picture-fighting-drug-menace/">drug menace in Punjab</a>), dissatisfaction among the Sikh diaspora and support from non-state actors.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> In order to curb the Khalistan movement and ideology, the Indian government needs to address the above-mentioned issues.</p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-2"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Issues Relating to Development and Management of Social Sector/Services relating to Education</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1901882"><strong>PIB</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The 2nd edition of the Foundational Literacy and Numeracy (FLN) report was released by Dr Bibek Debroy, Chairman EAC-PM.</p>
<p><strong>FLN:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is the ability of a child (between the ages of 3 and 8 years old) <strong>to read basic texts and do basic mathematical problems</strong> such as addition and subtraction.</li>
<li>It is one of the main elements of the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/issues-related-to-education-sector/new-education-policy/">National Education Policy <strong>(NEP) 2020.</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About the FLN report:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is <strong>a benchmark for states and UTs</strong> to track their performance in achieving <strong>universal foundational learning by 2026-27.</strong></li>
<li>Its findings cover the role <strong>of nutrition, access to digital technology and language-focused</strong> instructional approach.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>It captures:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>role of language in education</strong> and highlights distinct challenges faced in a multilingual environment.</li>
<li>The <strong>fundamental concepts children require</strong> to become skilled readers.</li>
<li><strong>Improving the learning outcomes</strong> using appropriate assessments and medium of instruction.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Need to integrate</strong> the medium of instruction and teaching in languages familiar to children.</li>
<li>Undertake various assessments pertaining to the –<ul>
<li>Linguistic system (includes phonology, vocabulary/lexicon, and syntax),</li>
<li>Orthographic system (includes symbols and mapping principles), and</li>
<li>Writing mechanisms</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Need for data monitoring along with clearly defined <strong>outcome-based indicators on pedagogical</strong> framework and education in India.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/11/15/editorial-analysis-where-no-child-is-left-behind/"><strong>Initiatives to promote FLN:</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://diksha.gov.in/about/"><strong>DIKSHA or Digital Infrastructure for Knowledge Sharing</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Launched in 2017, it is a national platform of the NCERT, where teachers can find interactive and engaging teaching material to make their classes interesting.</li>
<li><a href="https://nipunbharat.education.gov.in/"><strong>NIPUN Bharat Mission</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Launched in 2021 for ensuring that every child in the country necessarily attains foundational literacy by the end of the third grade by the year 2026-27.</li>
<li><a href="https://itpd.ncert.gov.in/"><strong>NISHTHA</strong></a><strong>:</strong> A new training program (in FLN) for the teachers, as well as the heads of the school launched by the NCERT.</li>
<li><a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1884943"><strong>The National Curriculum Framework for Foundational Skills 2022</strong></a><strong>:</strong> To meet a key focus area of the NEP 2020, to improve the foundational skills of students.<ul>
<li>Under this, ‘<strong>jadui pitara</strong>’ – learning and teaching material for the foundational stage of schooling, has been launched recently.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best practice:</strong> Haryana Government Initiative – Saksham Haryana</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/saksham.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/saksham.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> FLN is linked to the <strong>health and economic growth of a nation</strong>. So, developing curriculum, phonological awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension, is the need of the hour.</p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-2_1"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Functions and Responsibilities of the Union and the States</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/section-153a-its-use-and-misuse-pawan-khera-arrest-supreme-court-8465400/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The SC granted interim bail to a Congress leader (Pawan Khera) arrested for alleged <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/04/07/hate-speech/">hate speech</a> (booked under Section 153A of the IPC) by Assam Police.</p>
<p><strong>Section 153A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC): What the law says?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It penalises</strong> (with imprisonment up to 3 years/fine/both) <strong>promoting enmity</strong> between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc., and <strong>committing offences against the maintenance of peace</strong>.</li>
<li>The provision was enacted in <strong>1898</strong> and was not in the original penal code. In <strong>1969</strong>, the offence was amended (made cognisable – arrest without a warrant) to enlarge its scope to prevent communal tensions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The application of the law:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hate speech laws</strong> have been invoked under different regimes <strong>to crack down on criticism</strong> of public functionaries and to arrest individuals.</li>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> a Marathi actor was arrested (booked under Section 153A of the IPC) last year, for a Facebook post allegedly defaming an NCP leader.</li>
<li>According to the NCRB data, the rate of conviction for Section 153A is <strong>very low.</strong> In 2020, 1,804 cases were registered (six times higher than in 2014), however, the conviction rate was <strong>2%</strong>.</li>
<li>Also, the registration of multiple FIRs across different states <strong>drains the resources of the accused to secure legal representation.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Safeguards against misuse:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Section 153A requires prior sanction</strong> (before the trial begins, not at the stage of preliminary investigation) from the government for initiating prosecution.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Arnesh Kumar v State of Bihar case (2014)</strong>, <strong>the SC laid down a set of guidelines</strong>. For instance, the police <strong>cannot automatically arrest a suspect before investigation</strong> for crimes that carry a punishment of less than seven years.</li>
<li>In 2021, the SC ruled that the state will have to prove <strong>intent</strong> (to cause disorder or incite people to violence) for securing a conviction under Section 153A.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> <strong>Hate speech strikes at the foundational values</strong> of society. However, the suspected unlawful speech should be evaluated using the standards of reasonableness.</p>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/environmental-costs-russia-ukraine-war-846312/"><strong>Indian Express</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: The <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/11/editorial-analysis-lessons-from-russias-ukraine-war/">conflict in Ukraine</a> has racked up environmental costs that will far outlive the actual fighting.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/toxic-legacy-ukraine-war"><strong>How is the war affecting the environment</strong></a><strong>?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fighting-induced destruction: N</strong>uclear power plants and facilities, energy infrastructure, including oil storage tankers, oil refineries, drilling platforms and gas facilities and distribution pipelines, mines and industrial sites, and agro-processing facilities are getting destructed.</li>
<li><strong>Pollution</strong>: Air pollution and potentially serious contamination of <strong>ground and surface waters</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Deforestation</strong>: More than 2 <strong>million hectares of forest have been destroyed</strong>, wrecking ecosystems and putting rare endemic species at risk.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/02/22/what-is-carbon-watch-indias-1st-app-to-assess-ones-carbon-footprint/"><strong>Carbon footprint</strong></a>: Ukraine estimates the emissions from Russia’s invasion to be roughly around <strong>33 million tonnes of CO2 from the conflict and 23 million tonnes of CO2 from fires caused by the conflict.</strong> </li>
<li><strong>Nuclear radiation:</strong> Russian troops <strong>dug up deep trenches in the protected Chornobyl sanctuary,</strong> thereby releasing nuclear wastes and radiation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Solutions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reduce military activities:</strong> This requires the parties involved in the conflict to agree to a ceasefire and pursue diplomatic solutions to resolve their differences.</li>
<li><strong>Restore damaged ecosystems</strong>: This can include replanting forests, cleaning up polluted water sources, and rehabilitating habitats for wildlife.</li>
<li><strong>Implement environmental regulations</strong>: The private sector should also be held accountable for any environmental damage caused by their activities.</li>
<li><strong>Promote renewable energy</strong>: Governments should invest in renewable energy infrastructure, which will not only reduce carbon emissions but also create jobs and promote sustainable development.</li>
<li><strong>Raise public awareness:</strong> This can include organizing protests, writing articles and reports, and using social media to raise awareness.</li>
<li><strong>Provide support for affected communities</strong>: Governments and civil society organizations should provide support for these communities, including access to clean water, healthcare, and education.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Overall, mitigating the environmental costs of the Russia-Ukraine War requires a concerted effort from all stakeholders involved. By prioritizing the environment and taking concrete actions, we can reduce the long-term impact of the conflict on the planet and its inhabitants.</p>

<p>[The concepts of mitigation and adaptation](https://climate.nasa.gov/solutions/adaptation-mitigation/#:~:text=Mitigation%20%E2%80%93%20reducing%20climate%20change%20%E2%80%93%20involves,these%20gases%20(such%20as%20the) are at the <strong>heart of international climate discourse.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/climate-change-and-associated-issues/"><strong>Adaptation measures for climate change</strong></a></p>
<p>Adaptation refers to <strong>adjustments in ecological, social, or economic systems</strong> in response to actual or expected <strong>climatic stimuli and their effects or impacts. It focuses on</strong> assisting countries that are most vulnerable to the effects of <strong>climate change (coastal states, island nations) with finance and infrastructural assistance</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reason for Focusing on the adaptation of climate Change</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Can help manage the risks from climate disasters such as floods and droughts</strong></li>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Sponge-Cities.pdf"><strong>Sponge cities</strong></a> <strong>concept to increase storing of water</strong> in city spaces to adapt to urban floods</li>
<li><strong>Protection of ecosystems</strong></li>
<li><strong>Protecting agriculture and food security</strong></li>
<li><strong>Can allow populations to benefit from opportunities for climatic change.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mitigation measures for climate change</strong></p>
<p>Mitigation refers to actions <strong>taken to lower the concentration of greenhouse gasses</strong> in the atmosphere and thereby <strong>reduce the extent to which the global climate system changes</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reason for Focusing on Mitigation of Climate Change</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To stabilize greenhouse gas levels in a sufficient time frame</strong></li>
<li><strong>Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (</strong><a href="https://unfccc.int/topics/land-use/workstreams/redd/what-is-redd"><strong>REDD+)</strong></a></li>
<li><strong>Avoid significant human interference with the earth’s climate</strong></li>
<li><strong>Enable economic development</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why India is pushing to focus on Adaptation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Timeframe</strong>: Mitigation measures can take <strong>decades to have a significant impact</strong> but the impacts of climate change are <strong>already being felt and will continue to worsen</strong> in the short to medium term, making <strong>adaptation measures more urgent.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The scale of impact:</strong> Adaptation measures can <strong>help reduce vulnerability and minimize the negative impacts of climate change.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Political will</strong>: Adaptation measures, can <strong>be implemented at a local level and may be more feasible to achieve.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Co-benefits</strong>: improving public health, enhancing ecosystem services, and increasing resilience to other natural disasters.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>While adaptation is important, it should not be seen as a substitute for mitigation. Both <strong>strategies are needed to address the challenges of climate change and ensure a sustainable future for our planet</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="water-sensitive-cities-framework"><strong>Water-Sensitive Cities Framework</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Issues</strong>: There is a <strong>crisis of water supply, wastewater, and stormwater management</strong> in urban areas, especially in the global south, due to inequity in urban settlements.</p>
<p><strong>How to make our urban areas’ water secure in a just and inclusive way?</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Water conservation, groundwater recharge</strong> and decentralised non-sewered septage treatment systems need to be prioritised in planned settlements in a city</li>
<li>Cities commit to a <strong>“Just and Equitable Access, Use, Reuse”</strong> of water supply to sewerage/septage and stormwater management.</li>
<li><strong>‘Design thinking’</strong>: It assumes that cities need <strong>more green-blue infrastructure and not grey infrastructure,</strong> coupled with smart urban design elements.<ul>
<li>Integration of <strong>water planning and city planning</strong>g., Building roads and drains as per hydrogeography of a place</li>
<li>Green places as <strong>recharge areas</strong>g., Parks, and open spaces.</li>
<li><strong>Reuse of adequately treated wastewater</strong> for irrigation purposes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Water Sensitive Urban Design and Planning (WSUDP):</strong> WSUDP aims at combining groundwater recharge besides several accompanying measures that reduce runoff and increase infiltration.<ul>
<li>It integrates urban water cycle, water supply, wastewater, stormwater and groundwater management with spatial and urban design. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Usage:</strong> This can be used as an example/Way forward in Governance questions.</p>
<h3 id="8r-ethical-guidelines-for-use-of-traditional-knowledge"><strong>8R Ethical guidelines for use of Traditional Knowledge</strong></h3>
<p>A group of experts has <strong>proposed a set of ethical guidelines</strong> to guide practices on the use of traditional indigenous medicines and knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Current Issues</strong>:  Cultural appropriation, traditional indigenous medicine is not widely protected by law, there is no mechanism to provide reparation and share benefits with indigenous communities, USA is not part of <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/06/access-and-benefit-sharingabs-mechanisms/">CBD and ABS.</a></p>
<p><strong>8R principles:</strong> Respectful, Reverence, Relevant, Regulation, Reparation, Reconciliation, Responsibility, Restoration</p>
<ul>
<li>As of 2022, only the constitutions of <strong>Bolivia and Ecuador</strong>include regulations specific to Indigenous traditional medicine</li>
<li><strong>CBD’s Nagoya Protocol on Access and benefit-sharing (ABS):</strong> It mentions indigenous rights to the use and development of their traditional medicines and related practices</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mnemonic to remember 8R</strong> “<strong>R</strong>espectful <strong>R</strong>everence requires <strong>R</strong>elevant <strong>R</strong>egulation, <strong>R</strong>eparation, and <strong>R</strong>econciliation with <strong>R</strong>esponsibility for <strong>R</strong>estoration.”</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: Researchers, for the first time, have used the body’s <strong>own chemistry to develop electrodes in</strong> the <strong>tissues of zebrafish (a small freshwater fish).</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>They used the <strong>body sugars of the fish to transform an injectable gel</strong> into a flexible electrode while <strong>causing no damage to the tissues of the organism.</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>gel is built from a mixture of chemicals and enzymes</strong>, which are inactive. Interactions with body sugars such as <strong>lactose and glucose induce them to become electrically conductive.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Possible benefits of this:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If successful in future tests, the <strong>gel could one day replace conventional materials</strong> that help restore <strong>brain, eye, ear, spinal cord, nerve, and muscle functions</strong>. It could also help treat <strong>Parkinson’s disease</strong>, <strong>epilepsy, dystonia (a movement disorder), and depression.</strong></li>
<li>The gel was also tested in <strong>leeches and muscle tissues of cows</strong>, pigs, and chickens, <strong>showing encouraging results</strong>.</li>
<li>These findings, pave the way for <strong>creating soft electronics in various biological tissues and environments.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Zebrafish:</strong></p>
<p>The zebrafish is a freshwater fish belonging to the minnow family of the order <strong>Cypriniformes</strong>. <strong>Native</strong> to South Asia, it is a popular aquarium fish, frequently sold under the trade name zebra danio. It is also found in private ponds.</p>
