<p><strong>Context</strong>: A team of scientists from <strong>Ahmedabad-based Physical Research Laboratory (PRL),</strong> <strong>the United States, and Japan</strong> has found a unique group of ancient <strong>lunar basaltic meteorites</strong>, suggesting a new scenario for the <strong>origin of lunar basalts</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>More about the findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Apollo, Luna, and</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/09/25/change-5-probe-4/">Chang’E-5</a> <strong>missions</strong> have brought to Earth an extensive <strong>collection of mare basalts.</strong><ul>
<li>Mare basalts are <strong>formed by the partial melting of the lunar mantle, made of mostly pyroxene and olivine</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Apollo mare basalts are <strong>highly rich in potassium, rare earth elements, and phosphorous known as Procellarum KREEP Terrane (PKT</strong>).</li>
<li>KREEP is the acronym for a place that has deposits of <strong>potassium (chemical symbol – K), rare earth elements (REE), and phosphorus (chemical symbol – P)</strong>.</li>
<li>These are rich in radioactive elements that provide the <strong>heat to melt rocks resulting in KREEP-rich basalts</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>ISRO stated that the result shows that <strong>these basalts must be a result of low-pressure melting on the Moon, similar to those in other terrestrial bodies</strong>, such as Earth and Mars.</li>
<li>They also reveal that these basalts <strong>originated from a cool, shallow, and compositionally distinct part of the lunar interior</strong>.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Recently several interfaith couples <strong>including some celebrities chos</strong>e to marry under a secular personal law i.e. through the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/02/10/special-marriage-act/#:~:text=What%20is%20Special%20Marriage%20Act,solemnized%20by%20way%20of%20registration.">Special Marriage Act, of 1954.</a></p>
<p><strong>About Special Marriage Act, 1954:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Special Marriage Act of 1954 (SMA) was passed by <strong>Parliament on October 9, 1954. It</strong> governs a civil marriage where the <strong>state sanctions the marriage rather than the religion</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Need for such an act:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Laws, such as the <strong>Muslim Marriage Act, of 1954, and the Hindu Marriage Act, of 1955</strong>, require either <strong>spouse to convert to the religion of the other before marriage.</strong></li>
<li>However, the SMA enables marriage between <strong>inter-faith or inter-caste couples without them giving up their religious identity or resorting to conversion.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Who can get married under the Special Marriage Act?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The applicability of the <strong>Act extends to the people of all faiths, including Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, Sikhs, Jains, and Buddhists, across India</strong>.</li>
<li>The minimum age to get married under the <strong>SMA is 21 years for males and 18 years for females.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the procedure for a civil marriage?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As per Section 5 of the Act, the parties to the marriage are r<strong>equired to give a notice, in writing, to a “Marriage Officer”</strong> of the district in which at least one of the parties has resided for at least 30 days immediately preceding the notice.</li>
<li>The parties and three witnesses are required to sign a declaration form before the Marriage Officer.</li>
<li>Once the declaration is accepted, the parties will be given a “<strong>Certificate of marriage</strong>” which is essentially proof of the marriage.</li>

<h4 id="gs-paper-2"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>International Relations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/worldview-with-suhasini-haidar-bbc-adani-is-indian-diplomacy-on-the-defensive/article66521414.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The article will focus on India’s Defensive diplomacy. </p>
<p><strong>Recent developments worrying India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>BBC</strong> documentary raising questions about the current PM’s role in the <strong>Gujarat riots of 2002</strong>, and accusing the central government of <strong>instigating and condoning majoritarian violence.</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>Hindenberg Research</strong> accused Adani Enterprises Limited of several share market manipulations and false filings.</li>
<li>India came under criticism for increasing its imports of Russian oil.</li>
<li>The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) reacted to the above developments by calling them western hypocrisy, <strong>a colonial mindset,</strong> and <strong>a conspiracy to break Indian democracy.</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are the major worries for the MEA/Government?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The larger trend of criticism in the year of <strong>G20</strong></li>
<li><strong>Will dent India’s image</strong>, and make diplomacy much more difficult</li>
<li><strong>Will hurt India’s economic growth</strong>, which is just recovering from Covid, the Ukraine War, and the global recession</li>
<li><strong>Come from a colonial mindset</strong> and could lead to racist attacks on India and the diaspora</li>
<li>Worry about <strong>other international mechanisms</strong> being used like the FATF, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Some bright spots for India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NSA’s visit to Washington-UK-Moscow</strong>: Many agreements on technology cooperation, strategic issues, Afghanistan</li>
<li>MEA’s visit to Australia, Fiji</li>
<li>The upcoming visit of German Chancellor Scholz</li>
<li><strong>SCO Summit in June, G20 Summit in September</strong></li>
<li>Therefore, little to indicate that Western countries are trying to target India in any way or isolate it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How does Defensive diplomacy work?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Public statements, <strong>engaging media in foreign countries,</strong> embassies lobbying with Parliamentarians.</li>
<li><strong>Visa Bans/ Deportations/</strong> Restricting western NGOs from working or funding projects in India in a specific field.</li>
<li><strong>Punitive actions:</strong> Actions like raiding the BBC offices in India.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> According to Kenneth Waltz (Book – Theory of International Politics), <strong>defensive diplomacy encourages states to undertake defensive and moderate policies</strong> as their first concern is not to maximize power but to maintain their position in the system.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The following books can help an aspirant (especially with PSIR optional) to understand not only defensive diplomacy but also <strong>India and the World –</strong></p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-3"><strong>GS Paper 3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Science and Technology- Developments and their Applications and Effects in Everyday Life</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/explained-what-are-hallucinating-chatbots/article66520383.ece#:~:text=are%20hallucinating%20chatbots%3F-,Hallucination%20in%20AI%20chatbots%20is%20when%20a%20machine%20provides%20convincing,to%20queries%20with%20madeup%20answers."><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Google warned of the pitfalls of artificial intelligence (AI) in chatbots, as it can sometimes lead to “hallucination”.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> These reports emerged as <strong>OpenAI (ChatGPT), Google (Bard), and Microsoft (Bing’s beta)</strong> were opening up their AI-enabled chatbots for test users.</p>
<p><strong>What are hallucinating chatbots?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI chatbots</strong> are trained to have human-like conversations using a process known as <strong>natural language processing (NLP).</strong><ul>
<li>With NLP, they can <strong>interpret human language as it is written,</strong> which enables them to <strong>operate more or less on their own.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hallucination in AI chatbots is when a <strong>machine provides convincing but completely made-up answers (</strong>untrue facts<strong>)</strong>. It is not a new phenomenon.</li>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> after being live on Twitter for just 24 hours in 2016, Microsoft’s chatbot <strong>Tay</strong> started parroting racist and misogynistic slurs back at users.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why do AI chatbots start hallucinating?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Because these models require the <strong>capability to rephrase</strong>, summarise and present intricate tracts of text without constraints.</li>
<li>Facts, not being sacred, can be <strong>treated in contextual form</strong> when sifting through the information, as these models are <strong>unable to distinguish between</strong> contextual information and facts.</li>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> when asked, “What does Albert Einstein say about black holes?” AI models can return a quote made famous on the Internet rather than factual information.</li>
<li>The problem becomes acute when <strong>complex grammar source material is used.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The biggest challenge:</strong> Identification of hallucinated texts</p>
<p><strong>Way forward:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A method to recognize hallucinated output and include filters in AI models to recognize and eliminate such texts is being researched.</li>
<li><strong>Tabulate and collect</strong> hallucinated texts from AI models.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>The mandates</strong> of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) and the Food Fortification Resource Centre (FFRC) – an industry-led organisation under the FSSAI, <strong>are the opposite.</strong></li>
<li><strong>FSSAI</strong> – a statutory body, is supposed to be <strong>guided by principles of food safety</strong>, which include risk assessment, transparent public consultation, protection of consumer choice, etc.</li>
<li><strong>FFRC</strong>, on the other hand, has a sponsored promotional role – co-implementing fortification programmes, providing funding and advisory services, etc.</li>
<li>The presence of FFRC within FSSAI deserves <strong>further investigation and intervention to avoid conflict of interest.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Food Fortification:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Meaning:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is defined as the practice of <strong>adding vitamins and minerals</strong> to commonly consumed foods during processing to increase their nutritional value.</li>
<li>The Copenhagen Consensus ranked food fortification as one of the <strong>most cost-effective development priorities.</strong></li>
<li>It has been identified as the strategy by the WHO and FAO for <strong>decreasing the incidence of nutrient deficiencies</strong> at the global level.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scenario in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2022 placed <strong>India at 107th position</strong> (out of 121 nations) and the <strong>undernourished population</strong> is one of the primary reasons for this poor performance of India.</li>
<li>The momentum of food fortification accelerated in <strong>2016</strong> when the FSSAI established standards for the fortification of rice, wheat flour, edible oil, double-fortified salt (DFS) and milk.</li>
<li><strong>FFRC developed the ‘+F’ logo</strong> and helped build capacity for food producers.</li>
<li>The pilot – public food fortification programme, was launched in <strong>2019</strong> by the government (FSSAI) in partnership with external non-profits, who are also associated with the nutraceutical industry.</li>
<li>Fortified foods are now being <strong>included in public food schemes</strong> like PDS, ICDS, Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana and Mid-Day Meal Scheme/Poshan, helping to address the <strong>challenge of malnutrition.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Major issues with food fortification in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The one-sided portrayal</strong> of fortification as a ‘cure-all’ without any significant scientific perspective and evidence on fortification.</li>
<li><strong>No independent risk analysis:</strong> FSSAI’s statutory regulations caution against consuming iron-fortified food by patients with thalassemia and sickle cell anaemia.</li>
<li><strong>Conflict of interest:</strong> The studies which FSSAI relies on to promote fortification are sponsored by food companies.</li>
<li>Evaluation studies are still not publicly available.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fortification should be pushed for in a transparent manner by the decision-making body (FFRC) and the regulatory body (FSSAI).</li>
<li>To treat undernutrition in India, all three – dietary diversity, higher protein consumption and fortification, are essential.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Context</strong>:  The Apatanis (one of the major ethnic groups of the eastern Himalayas), practise integrated rice-fish farming (rice and fish are grown together)</p>
<ul>
<li>These farmers have been <strong>practising integrated rice-fish farming</strong> in their mountain terraces of <strong>Arunachal Pradesh</strong> since the 1960s.</li>
<li>This integrated rice-fish cultivation is a <strong>low-input and eco-friendly practice</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Azolla and Lemna</strong> are also grown in the field water as nitrogen fixers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Fish enhances rice productivity</strong> (by 10-15 per cent) by controlling the growth of algae, weeds and insects, providing nutrient input through fish excreta and promoting tillering of the rice through the movement of fish inside the field.</li>
<li>Further, <strong>the mineralization of organic matter, puddling of mud and soil aeration by other benthos enhances</strong> rice yield here.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Usage</strong>: It can be used to <strong>show traditional eco-friendly organic</strong> agriculture practices.</p>
<p><strong>Related Information:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Apatani tribe of Arunachal Pradesh lives <strong>at Ziro,</strong> the headquarters of the lower Subansiri district</li>
<li>They speak a local language called <strong>Tani</strong>and worship <strong>the sun and the moon.</strong></li>
<li>They follow a <strong>sustainable social forestry system</strong>.</li>
<li>The major festivals of Apatanis are the <strong>Myoko, Dree, Yapung and Murung</strong>.</li>
<li>Apatani Plateau has a climate ranging from <strong>humid subtropical to temperate</strong></li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> A preliminary report by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Commission of Nepal on the crash of a Yeti Airlines ATR 72-500 brought to light that the propellers of the plane <strong>were found in an unusual “feathered” position.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is ‘feathering’?</strong></p>
<p><strong>In simple terms,</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes an aeroplane’s engine stops working while it’s flying. In an aeroplane with a propeller, the pilot can change the angle of the propeller blades so they cut through the air more efficiently. This is called “<strong>feathering</strong>” the propellers.</p>
<p>Feathering helps the <strong>aeroplane glide farther and stay at a safe speed</strong>. When pilots have to make an emergency landing, they often use feathering to help them. If the propellers keep spinning even when the engine is off, it can be dangerous if the aeroplane is flying low, but it can actually help restart the engine if the aeroplane is flying high.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Central government will not consider demands for “special category status” for any state.</p>
<ul>
<li>States such as <strong>Odisha (vulnerability to natural disasters), Andhra Pradesh and Bihar (backwardness)</strong> have been pushing for <strong>“special category status”</strong> for some years now.</li>
<li><strong>The 14th Finance commission</strong> has clearly said no special status can be given.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Special Category Status (SCS):</strong></p>
<p>It is a classification given by the Centre to assist the development of states that face geographical and socio-economic disadvantages (on the <strong>recommendations of the 5th Finance Commission</strong> in 1969 and is the <strong>Gadgil formula</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>The parameters for SCS were:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hilly Terrain</li>
<li>Low Population Density And/Or Sizeable Share of Tribal Population</li>
<li>Strategic Location along Borders with Neighboring Countries</li>
<li>Economic and Infrastructure Backwardness</li>
<li>Nonviable Nature of State finances</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Currently, 11 states enjoy SCS.</strong> There is no provision for SCS in the Constitution. <strong>The 14th Finance Commission</strong> has done away with <strong>the ‘special category status’ for states</strong>, except for the northeastern and three hill states.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits to States with SCS:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>States with SCS, avail 90% of funds</strong> in centrally sponsored schemes, instead of the present arrangement of 60%</li>
<li><strong>Unspent money</strong> does not lapse and is carried forward.</li>
<li><strong>Significant concessions</strong>are provided to these states in <strong>excise and customs duties</strong>, income tax and corporate tax.</li>
