<p><strong>Direction: This article is in continuation of our previous article on</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/23/unusual-february-heat-and-the-normal-abnormal-in-global-weather-heat-dome/"><strong>heat waves in northern India.</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context: T</strong>he <strong>India Meteorological Department (IMD)</strong> warned that the <strong>maximum temperatures</strong> over <strong>northwest, west, and central India would be 3-5° C higher</strong> than the long-term average.</p>
<p><strong>What is heat wave?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>According to the IMD, a region has a <strong>heat wave if its ambient temperature deviates by at least 4.5-6.4° C</strong> from the long-term average. There is also a heat wave if the <strong>maximum temperature crosses 45° C (or 37° C at a hill-station).</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Origin of Heat Wave in India:</strong></p>
<p>A study published in <strong>Nature Geoscience</strong> offers some clues as to <strong>how different processes contribute</strong> to the <strong>formation of a heat wave.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In spring, India typically <strong>has air flowing in from the west-northwest</strong>. The Middle East is warming faster than other regions in latitudes similarly close to the equator, and <strong>serves as a source of the warm air that blows into India.</strong></li>
<li>Air flowing in from the <strong>northwest rolls in over the mountains of Afghanistan and Pakistan</strong>, so some of the compression also happens on the leeward side of these mountains, entering India with a bristling warmth.</li>
<li>The air flowing in over the <strong>oceans is expected to bring cooler</strong> air, but the <strong>Arabian Sea is warming faster than most other ocean regions.</strong></li>
<li>The strong upper atmospheric westerly winds that come in from the Atlantic Ocean over to India during spring control the near-surface winds. The energy to run past the earth near the surface, against the surface friction, can only come from above. This <strong>descending air compresses and warms up to generate some heat waves.</strong></li>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/climate-change-and-associated-issues/what-causes-global-warming/">Global warming</a> tends to warm the upper atmosphere faster than the air near the surface. This in turn means that the <strong>sinking air is warmer due to global warming, and thus produces heat waves as it sinks and compresses.</strong></li>

<h4 id="gs-paper-2"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Government Policies and Interventions for Development in various sectors and Issues arising out of their Design and Implementation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lack-of-protection-officers-for-domestic-violence-cases-intrigues-sc-about-mission-shakti/article66557250.ece#:~:text=The%20Supreme%20Court%20has%20sought,deal%20with%20domestic%20violence%20cases."><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The SC has sought more information about <a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1841498"><strong>Mission Shakti</strong></a> because it is concerned about a persistent lack of protection officers to handle <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/11/29/editorial-analysis-still-a-nightmare-for-domestic-violence-survivors/">domestic violence</a> cases.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Appointment of protection officers (ideally women) is mandated under Section 8 of <strong>the</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/11/28/sansad-tv-acts-facts-the-protection-of-women-from-domestic-violence-act-2005/"><strong>Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005.</strong></a></li>
<li>These officers have a pivotal role:<ul>
<li><strong>Help victims file complaints</strong>,</li>
<li>Give Information to the police,</li>
<li>Provide immediate protection and support,</li>
<li>Inform victims about their legal rights and</li>
<li>Support them through the court proceedings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>With <strong>4.4 lakh cases pending</strong> in 801 districts, <strong>a protection officer in each of these districts would be saddled with over 500 cases.</strong></li>
<li>Even though Mission Shakti provided for the “<strong>one-stop centers</strong>” in most of these districts to receive victims, it is unclear how many of them employ protection officers.</li>
<li>The government has also been asked about whether Mission Shakti will serve as an umbrella scheme for implementing the Domestic Violence Act.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The law, which is overseen by the Union Ministry of Women and Child Development (<strong>MWCD</strong>), provides a definition of <strong>“domestic violence”</strong> <strong>for the first time</strong>.</li>
<li>Domestic violence <strong>includes not only physical violence</strong>, but also <strong>emotional, verbal, sexual and psychological abuse.</strong></li>
<li>It is a <strong>civil</strong> law meant primarily for protection orders, rather than criminal enforcement.</li>

<h4 id="gs-paper-2_1"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/towards-transparency-in-ott-regulation/article66556360.ece">The Hindu</a></p>
<p><strong>Context: Even after</strong> two years of issuing the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/05/26/the-information-technology-guidelines-for-intermediaries-and-digital-media-ethics-code-rules-2021/">Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules</a> there has not been much improvement in the regulation of OTT platforms.</p>
<ul>
<li>India’s approach can be termed as a <strong>light-touch ‘co-regulation’</strong> model where there is ‘<strong>self-regulation’ at the industry level and final ‘oversight mechanism’ at the Ministry level.</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Issues plaguing OTT regulation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of awareness:</strong> The Rules mandate the display of contact details relating to grievance redressal mechanisms and grievance officers on OTT websites/interface. <strong>However, compliance is very low.</strong> </li>
<li>While the Rules require disclosure of grievance details by publishers and self-regulating bodies, the reporting formats <strong>only capture the number of complaints received and decided</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ambiguity around content regulation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Jurisdictional issues</strong>: Many OTT platforms are based outside India, which makes it difficult to enforce regulations and hold them accountable.</li>
<li><strong>Freedom of expression concerns.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Solutions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The OTT industry associations could be mandated to run periodic <strong>campaigns in print and electronic media about the grievance redressal mechanism</strong></li>
<li>The interpretation of age rating (UA 13+, for example) and the content descriptors ( ‘violence’, for instance) could be in the <strong>respective languages of the video (apart from English).</strong></li>
<li>An <strong>independent body</strong> may undertake a periodic audit.</li>
<li>The Ministry could consider facilitating a dedicated <strong>umbrella website wherein the details of applicable</strong> <strong>Rules, content codes, advisories, contact details</strong> for complaints/appeals, etc. <strong>are published.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples from other countries:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Singapore</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Infocomm Media Development Authority</strong> is the common regulator for different media. Apart from instituting a statutory framework and promoting industry self-regulation, its <strong>approach to media regulation emphasizes on promoting media literacy through public education.</strong></li>

<p><strong>Context: Digital technology</strong> is playing an important role in achieving <strong>India’s G20 Presidency goal (“Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” or “One Earth, One Family, One Future”).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Indian Presidency’s priority is to make the <strong>digital financial system more efficient, secure, and stable</strong>.</li>
<li>For this to happen, f<strong>inancial sector regulatory</strong> reforms are essential.</li>
<li>However, there is <strong>no comprehensive global policy framework for</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/science-technology/communication-and-it-technology/cryptocurrency/"><strong>crypto assets</strong></a><strong>,</strong> despite the rapid evolution of the crypto universe.</li>
<li>The global standard-setting bodies (such as the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/02/22/fatf/">FATF</a>, Financial Stability Board (FSB), Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), etc) have been <strong>coordinating the regulatory agenda.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Probable benefits of crypto assets:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cheaper and faster cross-border payments</li>
<li>More integrated financial markets</li>
<li>Increased <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/07/16/financial-inclusion/">financial inclusion</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Greater interconnectedness</strong> between crypto assets and the traditional financial sector</li>
<li><strong>Complexity and volatility</strong> around crypto assets</li>
<li>Critical digital infrastructure/platforms</li>
<li>Global information gaps pertaining to the crypto asset</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p><strong>How can the Indian G20 Presidency shape Global Policy Dialogue on Crypto Assets?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Broaden the discussion on crypto assets:</strong> Beyond financial integrity concerns and capture the macroeconomic implications and widespread crypto adoption in the economy.</li>
<li><strong>Inform policymakers</strong>: On the broader macroeconomic and financial stability implications of crypto assets.</li>
<li><strong>Highlight the consequences of crypto adoption:</strong> On the internal and external stability of a country’s economy as well as on the structure of its financial system.</li>
</ul>

<p>Farmers belonging to the <strong>Chuktia Bhunjia tribe (a PVTG) in Sunabeda</strong>, <strong>Odisha</strong> (in the tropical deciduous forest of the <strong>Sunabeda Wildlife Sanctuary</strong>) have <strong>successfully</strong> cultivated strawberries as part of a <strong>government-sponsored program</strong>.</p>
<p>Thanks to a climate similar to that of <strong>Mahabaleshwar in Maharashtra, where 80% of India’s strawberries are produced</strong>, farmers in Sunabeda have been able to cultivate strawberries that bear fruit continuously.</p>
<p><strong>Usage</strong>: The case study/example can be used to show successful government intervention for creating sustainable farming and income for PVTGs, empowering women (as women are heavily involved in the cultivation process), and the importance of SHGs in creating income-generating assets.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/what-solar-geoengineering">Solar geoengineering, also called solar radiation modification</a>, involves cooling the earth by radiating <strong>absorbed sunlight back into space</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Types of solar geoengineering</strong>   </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI)</strong><ul>
<li>SAI includes <strong>spraying large quantities of tiny particles (e.g. of Sulphur Dioxides)</strong> into the earth’s stratosphere to reflect sunlight The <strong>concept of SAI is derived from sulphur clouds released during volcanic eruptions</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Marine cloud brightening</strong><ul>
<li>Marine cloud brightening proposes spra<strong>ying sea salt into low-lying clouds to increase their brightness and the ability to reflect sunlight.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why is it controversial?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>SAI is particularly controversial because the <strong>reflective effect of aerosols wears off after some time, leading to a net heating effect.</strong></li>
<li>According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, solar geoengineering can be a “<strong>moral hazard” and slow efforts towards emission reduction as it does not address the root cause of climate change</strong>.</li>
