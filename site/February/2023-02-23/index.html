<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/unusual-feb-heat-and-the-normal-abnormal-in-global-weather-8459137/#:~:text=Average%20global%20temperatures%20in%202022,of%20the%20La%20Ni%C3%B1a%20event."><strong>Indian Express</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: Over the past week, maximum temperatures have been <strong>5-11 degrees C higher than normal in</strong> <strong>most parts of northern and western India.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reasons for abnormal heat:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>According to the IMD, <strong>an anticyclonic formation over south Gujarat is one of the main reasons</strong> for the warming on the west coast.</li>
<li>Around Maharashtra and Goa, a <strong>weaker-than-usual sea breeze along the Konkan coast was aggravating</strong> the effects of the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/world-geography/physical-geography-of-the-world/climatology/cyclones-and-anticyclones/anti-cyclone/#:~:text=An%20anticyclone%20is%20a%20weather,(opposite%20to%20a%20cyclone).">anticyclone.</a></li>
<li>This year is widely expected to be a little hotter than the previous two years, mainly because of the <strong>expected end of the strongest-ever</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/10/22/what-is-la-nina-2/">La Niña</a> <strong>event.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/07/03/what-is-the-heat-dome-causing-record-temperatures-in-parts-of-north-america/"><strong>heat domes</strong></a><strong>?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A heat dome is a <strong>meteorological phenomenon that occurs when a high-pressure system traps hot air</strong> in a region, <strong>causing temperatures to rise and creating a dome of hot air</strong>. This dome of hot air can persist for several days or weeks, leading to prolonged periods of extreme heat and heat waves.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/heat_dome.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/heat_dome.png" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Effects of Heat Dome:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>They are dangerous for human health,</strong> especially for vulnerable populations such as <strong>the elderly, children, and those with preexisting health conditions.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Impacts food production</strong></li>
<li><strong>Increasing wildfires.</strong></li>
<li>Lead to <strong>droughts and other environmental impacts</strong></li>
<li>Increased <strong>energy demand</strong> and strain on <strong>the power grid due to increased use of air conditioning.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What can be done?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Staying hydrated, avoiding outdoor activities</strong> during the hottest parts of the day, and providing cooling centres for vulnerable populations.</li>
<li>Governments and policymakers can also take steps to <strong>reduce greenhouse gas emissions</strong> and mitigate the impacts of <strong>climate change to prevent the frequency and intensity of heat domes</strong> from increasing further.</li>

<h4 id="gs-paper-3"><strong>GS Paper 3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus: Energy: Renewable Solar Energy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/opinion/rooftop-solar-for-poverty-alleviation-123022101397_1.html"><strong>BS</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> A new white paper proposes a scheme for rooftop solar photovoltaics (RTPV) for <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-economy-3/poverty-and-unemployment/poverty/">poverty alleviation.</a></p>
<p><strong>Significance of RTPV for poverty alleviation in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Access to Electricity:</strong> Solar energy can provide access to electricity in remote areas that are not connected to the power grid, thus improving the quality of life for people living in poverty.<ul>
<li>In China, RTPV is one of the identified <strong>10 initiatives rolled out</strong> by the government to lift rural households out of poverty.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cost Savings:</strong> For people living in poverty, who spend a significant portion of their income on energy, solar energy can help reduce their energy bills and save money.</li>
<li><strong>Job Creation:</strong> at the lower and middle level</li>
<li><strong>Improved Health:</strong> Solar energy can help reduce <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/environment-pollution-and-control/air-pollution/">indoor air pollution</a> and improve the health of people living in poverty.</li>
<li><strong>Climate Change Mitigation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>High initial cost</strong>: Currently, the rooftop-subsidy programmes run by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy require consumers to bear about 60 per cent of the costs.</li>
<li><strong>Roof Availability</strong>: For many poor, having roof space is a luxury.</li>
<li><strong>Dependence on Weather</strong>: In areas with low sunlight, or during monsoon season, solar energy production may be limited, which can be a challenge for those relying on it for electricity.</li>
<li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Solar panels require regular maintenance, which can be a challenge for people living in poverty who may not have the resources or knowledge to maintain them.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation issues:</strong> India had achievedjust 7.9 GW of installed rooftop solar capacity as of June 2022 (against a previous target of 40 GW by 2022).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Government measures:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>National level:</strong><ul>
<li>The government has extended the timeline for achieving its target of <strong>40000 MW (40 GW)</strong> rooftop solar (RTS) capacity addition, by March 2026.<ul>
<li><strong>Gujarat, Maharashtra and Haryana states</strong>are leading the way</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the proposed scheme for RPTVs?</strong></p>
<p><strong>The report proposes a Central government-sponsored scheme in the field of RTPV.</strong> It could be called <strong>Sooraj Se Rozgaari</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Under the proposed scheme, IREDA will purchase RTPV modules in bulk and transfer them to states at a cheaper cost. Low-income households do not have to pay for any share of the costs of RTPV installation and maintenance. Social/institutional/small businesses bear 80 per cent of the costs, and households with regular incomes bear 60 per cent.</li>

<li>That’s why government officials from 51 countries want to negotiate the <a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/governance/fresh-negotiations-on-un-high-seas-treaty-begin-in-new-york-here-s-what-to-expect-87830#:~:text=Published%3A%20Tuesday%2021%20February%202023%20Photo%3A%20iStock%20A,%28BBNJ%29%20began%20in%20New%20York%20February%2020%2C%202023.">High Seas Treaty at the UN in New York.</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why is a global treaty essential for the conservation of the high seas?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While the high seas (beyond national jurisdiction) make up <strong>more than 60% of the world’s oceans</strong>, they have drawn far less attention than coastal waters.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple organisations</strong> control fishing, shipping, tourism and ocean protection, however, their regulations apply to <strong>200 nm</strong> (370 km) from the coast.</li>
<li>The entire <strong>sea industry is equivalent to 5% of the world’s GDP</strong> (<strong>~ $3 trillion</strong>) sustaining not just coast dwellers, <strong>but almost 3 billion people worldwide</strong>.</li>
<li>The oceans generate <strong>sustainable wave/tidal energy,</strong> as well as key for the production of some commodities/medicine.<ul>
<li>For instance, a shallow water sponge called <strong>Tectitethya crypta</strong> (in the Caribbean waters) is used to <strong>fight leukaemia</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>More than half of the total amount of oxygen</strong> is created by creatures in the ocean, which also <strong>stores 50 times more CO2</strong> than found in the atmosphere.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How can we protect ocean ecosystems?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Preventing bad fishing practices and processing, and building sustainable sewage systems</strong> (80% of global wastewater is currently being diverted into oceans).</li>
<li><strong>India’s approach to biodiversity management</strong> is congruent with three globally accepted principles: <strong>conservation, sustainable usage, and equitable benefit sharing.</strong></li>
<li><strong>India’s legislative framework</strong> – <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/biodiversity/">the Biodiversity Act 2002</a><strong>,</strong> Marine Protected Areas, Marine Genetic Resources, <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/environment-impact-assessment/">Environmental Impact Assessment</a> – bears witness to these values.</li>
<li>According to the UNEP, <strong>international treaties</strong> are one of the best ways to stop the destruction of oceans.<ul>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> the EU is pushing for the implementation of the historic <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/22/a-new-global-biodiversity-framework/">2022 Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The adoption of the BBNJ agreement is essential for the conservation and preservation of the oceans and their biodiversity, to ensure sustainable development.</li>
<li>For this, <strong>equitable benefit sharing, capacity building and transfer of marine technology</strong> should be at the core.</li>
<li><strong>If nothing changes, half of all sea dwellers will be critically endangered by the end of this century (UNESCO).</strong></li>

<p><strong>Context: India currently hosts 17% of the planet’s human population and 17% of the global area in biodiversity hotspots</strong>, placing it at the helm to guide the planet in becoming <strong>biodiversity champion</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Programmes launched in India towards biodiversity conservation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/02/union-budget-2023-24/#:~:text=The%20total%20receipts%20other%20than,to%20be%209%25%20of%20GDP.">The Union Budget 2023</a><strong>:</strong> It mentioned “<strong>Green Growth</strong>” as one of the seven priorities/<strong>Saptarishis</strong>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/02/03/green-india-mission-2/">The National Mission for a Green India</a><strong>:</strong> It aims to increase forest cover on degraded lands and protect existing forested lands.</li>
<li><strong>The Green Credit Programme:</strong> It <strong>incentivises environmentally sustainable and responsive actions</strong> by companies, individuals and local bodies.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/06/why-have-mangroves-got-a-budget-push/">The Mangrove Initiative for Shoreline Habitats &amp; Tangible Incomes (MISHTI)</a>: It is significant because of the importance of mangroves and coastal ecosystems in mitigating climate change.</li>
<li><strong>The PM Programme for Restoration, Awareness, Nourishment, and Amelioration of Mother Earth (PM-PRANAM):</strong> It aims to reduce inputs of synthetic fertilisers and pesticides, which is critical for sustaining agriculture.</li>
<li><strong>The Amrit Dharohar scheme:</strong> It is expected to <strong>encourage optimal use of wetlands</strong> and enhance biodiversity, carbon stock, eco-tourism opportunities and income generation for local communities.<ul>
<li>The recent intervention by the Union Ministry of Environment to stop the draining of <a href="https://rsis.ramsar.org/ris/2463">Haiderpur, a Ramsar wetland in UP</a>, to safeguard migratory waterfowl is encouraging.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All the above initiatives are critical, as the country is facing <strong>serious losses of natural assets such as soils, land, water, and biodiversity.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>International initiative:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>At the <strong>UN Biodiversity Conference (2022</strong>) in Montreal, Canada, 188 country representatives adopted an agreement known as the <strong>30×30 pledge.</strong></li>
<li>It aims to <strong>“halt and reverse”</strong> biodiversity loss <strong>by conserving 30% of the world’s land and 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges faced by India:</strong> Climate change → Global warming → Increases pest attack and diseases in crops/higher demands for water → reducing farm yields</p>
<p><strong>Way ahead for these programmes to address the current state of biodiversity:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Evidence-based implementation:</strong> It is critical not only for the success of these efforts but also for the documentation of <strong>lessons learnt</strong> for replication.</li>
<li><strong>New programmes:</strong> Should effectively use modern concepts of <strong>sustainability and valuation of ecosystems</strong> that consider <strong>ecological-cultural-sociological aspects of our biological wealth</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Reduction in water use in key sectors:</strong> Such as agriculture by encouraging –<ul>
<li>Changes to less-water-intensive crops such as millet</li>
<li>Investments in water recycling in urban areas using a combination of grey and blue-green infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ecological restoration rather than tree plantation:</strong> As far as the Green India Mission is concerned, choosing sites to ensure <strong>ecological connectivity in landscapes</strong> fragmented by linear infrastructure.</li>
<li><strong>Local community involvement:</strong> Traditional knowledge and practices of these communities (local and nomadic) should be integrated into the implementation plans.</li>
<li><strong>Each programme should include significant educational/research funding:</strong> To critically appraise and bring awareness to India’s biological wealth.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The sum and variation of our biological wealth/biodiversity are essential to the future of this planet.</li>
<li>With this in mind, the Indian govt. is planning to launch <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/06/07/insights-into-editorial-saving-biodiversity-securing-earths-future/">the National Mission on Biodiversity and Human Wellbeing</a> soon<strong>,</strong> using the power of interdisciplinary knowledge for greening India and its economy.</li>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/environment/new-policy-to-help-indian-communities-displaced-by-annual-river-coastal-erosion-drafted-87862"><strong>DTE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/09/29/national-disaster-management-authority/">The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA)</a> received the final inputs on the draft of <strong>India’s first national policy</strong> for the mitigation and rehabilitation of the people affected by river and coastal erosion.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Union Ministry of Home Affairs had directed NDMA to draft a policy based on the <strong>15th</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/functions-and-responsibilities-of-the-union-and-the-states-issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure-devolution-of-powers-and-finances-up-to-local-levels-and-challenges-therein/issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure/centre-state-relations/finance-commission/#:~:text=It%20is%20required%20to%20make,respective%20shares%20of%20such%20proceeds"><strong>Finance Commission’s</strong></a> report (2021).</li>
<li>Until now, most policies in the country only address displacement after sudden rapid-onset <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/disaster-management/">disasters</a> such as floods and cyclones.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Highlights of the 15th Finance Commission’s report:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It introduces mitigation measures</strong> to prevent erosion under the National Disaster Mitigation Fund (NDMF), with an allocation of Rs 1,500 crore for 2021-26.</li>
<li><strong>For the resettlement of displaced people</strong> affected by erosion, it allocates R 1,000 crore for the same period under the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/10/05/national-disaster-response-fund-ndrf/">National Disaster Relief Fund (NDRF).</a></li>
<li>The total allocation of Rs 2,500 crore, not just for structural (construction of sea walls and embankments) but also for non-structural solutions (rehabilitation), is a <strong>national recognition of the problem</strong>.</li>
<li>For both funds, <strong>state governments will have to avail resources</strong> on a cost-sharing basis, contributing 25% (NE states – 10%) to the costs of mitigation and resettlement.</li>
<li><strong>NDMA</strong> will coordinate the allocations and expenses under NDRF and NDMF at the national level.</li>
<li><strong>The states must follow timelines</strong> for mitigation and rehabilitation projects without delays.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Highlights of the NDMA’s draft policy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It put in place some institutional mechanisms to manage displacement, which can be enacted under <strong>the</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/disaster-management/national-disaster-management-act-2005/"><strong>Disaster Management Act 2005.</strong></a></li>
<li><strong>Mapping</strong> coastal and river erosion impacts and coming up with a database of diverse challenges confronted by the affected and vulnerable habitations.</li>
<li><strong>District disaster management authorities (DDMA)</strong> would be the <strong>nodal agency</strong> to implement the measures, aided by other district agencies and a specific panchayat-level committee.<ul>
<li>The DDMA will prepare mitigation and rehabilitation plans → SDMAs → NDMA → the home ministry will approve the disbursal of funds.</li>
<li><strong>A qualified disaster management professional</strong> must be included in all teams.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Projects under NDRF and NDMF should be sanctioned in such a manner that they <strong>can be completed within the award period</strong> of the Commission.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Concerns:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The policy considers only erosion-linked displacement, <strong>but there is displacement owing to the deposition of eroded materials.</strong></li>
<li>It is not clear <strong>what the financial allocation</strong> (on a first-come, first-serve/on population density basis) will be under the policy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Detailed hazard assessments</strong> carried out by central agencies such as the National Centre for Coast Research, etc., be made available to the SDMAs.</li>
<li><strong>Mapping of fallow areas</strong> must be taken up for rehabilitation.</li>
<li>These should be made available in <strong>easy-to-access geographic information systems</strong> (GIS) formats by the NDMA.</li>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: Recently, an <strong>IPS officer and an IAS officer</strong> from Karnataka were involved in a <strong>verbal debate on</strong> <strong>Social media</strong> this has put the focus on a larger issue of how <strong>civil service ethos is undergoing through participation in social media.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The issue of lowering the efficiency of Civil Servants:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Less manpower:</strong> The parliamentary standing committee said that there <strong>are 22% fewer IAS</strong> <strong>officers in the country than</strong> the sanctioned strength.</li>
<li><strong>Not enough reforms and incentives:</strong> The government’s lack of reforms in incentives and penalties have helped <strong>incapacity, indifference, and corruption creep in.</strong></li>
<li>Lack of <strong>functional independence</strong></li>
<li><strong>Social media addictions</strong>: The self-aggrandizement stimulated <strong>by social media addictions is a new challenge to the All India Services (Conduct) Rules, 1968.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Unattractive private sector:</strong> The private sector still isn’t attractive and big enough for breaking the charm of government services such as prestige, power, and job security.</li>

<li><strong>Breach of confidentiality</strong></li>
<li><strong>Inappropriate behaviour</strong></li>
<li><strong>Risk to reputation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Lack of accountability</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to tackle this issue:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Training:</strong> Civil servants should be provided with <strong>training on the appropriate use of social media.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Code of conduct</strong>: A code of conduct should be <strong>established for civil servants’ use of social media.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Separation of personal and professional accounts</strong></li>
<li><strong>Monitoring and enforcement</strong>: Government departments should <strong>monitor civil servants’ social media use and enforce the code of conduct</strong></li>
<li><strong>Transparency and accountability</strong></li>
<li><strong>Time management:</strong> Civil servants should be provided with clear guidelines on the appropriate amount of <strong>time that should be spent on social media and encouraged to prioritize their official duties.</strong></li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Family courts</strong> should direct a <strong>DNA test to ascertain the paternity</strong> of a child only as a last resort.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact of such test:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Not knowing who one’s father is <strong>creating mental trauma in a child</strong></li>
<li>Allowing DNA tests would also <strong>harm the reputation and dignity</strong> of the mother</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is a DNA paternity test?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A DNA paternity test uses DNA</strong>, usually taken from a <strong>cheek swab</strong>, to determine whether a man is the child’s biological father.</p>
<ul>
<li>The lab compares the tissue samples from the mother, the child, and the man to see what special characteristics – <strong>known as “genetic markers” –</strong> the child shares with the mother and the man. These tests are very accurate in showing whether or not the man is the biological father of a child.</li>

<li>Flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) is a <strong>set of technologies used to remove sulfur dioxide (SO2)</strong> from exhaust flue gases of <strong>fossil-fuel power plants</strong> and from the emissions of other sulfur oxide emitting processes such as <strong>waste incineration, petroleum refineries, cement and lime kilns.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Some methods of FGD</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wet scrubbing</strong>using a slurry of alkaline sorbent, usually limestone or lime, or seawater to scrub gases;</li>
<li><strong>Spray-dry scrubbing</strong> using similar sorbent slurries;</li>
<li><strong>Wet sulfuric acid process</strong>recovering sulfur in the form of commercial quality sulfuric acid;</li>
<li><strong>SNOX Flue gas desulfurization</strong>removes sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulates from flue gases;</li>
<li><strong>Dry sorbent injection systems</strong> that introduce powdered hydrated lime (or other sorbent material) into exhaust ducts to eliminate SO2 and SO3 from process emissions</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Context</strong>:  <strong>National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and the Department of Fertilizers</strong>, Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers are going to take up field trials on NHAI projects for <strong>use of Phosphor-Gypsum (Phosphogypsum) in National Highway construction to achieve a circular economy in the use of Gypsum.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>About Phosphogypsum:</strong></p>
<p>Phosphogypsum (PG) is the <strong>calcium sulfate hydrate</strong> formed as a <strong>by-product of the production of fertilizer from phosphate rock</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>What are Anti particles?</strong></p>
<p>In particle physics, every type of particle is associated with an antiparticle with the same mass but with opposite physical charges. For example, the antiparticle of the electron is the positron.</p>
<ul>
<li>If a particle and its anti-particle meet, they will destroy each other in a flash of energy.</li>
<li><strong>Neutrinos have anti-neutrinos</strong> as antiparticles but since both don’t have any charge, it is really difficult to differentiate them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance of the findings:</strong></p>
<p>It can help to decipher the properties of Neutrinos, which can offer insight into the structure of the universe.</p>
