<p><strong>Syllabus</strong><strong>: Ancient India: Vijayanagara Kingdom</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/victory-city-vijayanagara-8432471/"><strong>Indian Express</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: Salman Rushdie released a new novel <strong>“Victory City”</strong> – a fictionalized story of the Vijayanagara Kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>About</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/medieval-indian-history/vijayanagara/"><strong>Vijaynagara</strong></a> <strong>Kingdom: 1336 AD – 1646 AD</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Founded by <strong>Harihara I of the Sangama dynasty,</strong> Vijayanagara expanded from a strategic position on the banks of the <strong>Tungabhadra river with Hampi as its capital.</strong></li>
<li>The kingdom reached its <strong>peak under</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/02/26/sri-krishnadevaraya/"><strong>Krishna Deva Raya</strong></a> <strong>(reign 1509-1529),</strong> a period in which it enjoyed military superiority to its rival kingdoms such as the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/medieval-indian-history/bahamani-kingdom/"><strong>Bahmani Sultanate</strong></a><strong>, the Golconda Sultanate, and the Gajapatis of Odisha.</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Economy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Largely dependent on agriculture</strong>, trade thrived in its many ports on either coast.</li>
<li>Traveller <strong>Abd al-Razzaq Samarqandi</strong> chronicled how “<strong>the ports of Mangalore, Honavar, Bhatkal, Barkur, Cochin, Cannanore, Machilipatnam, and Dharmadam saw traders from Africa, Arabia, Aden, the Red sea, China and Bengal and also served as shipbuilding centres</strong>”.</li>
<li>The empire’s principal <strong>exports were pepper, ginger, cinnamon, cardamom, myrobalan, tamarind, timber, anafistula, precious and semi-precious stones, pearls, musk, ambergris, rhubarb, aloe, cotton cloth, and porcelain.</strong></li>
<li>Coins were minted by the state as well as by merchant guilds using <strong>gold, silver, copper, and brass, and their value depended on material weight.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Architecture and Literature:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Literature in <strong>Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, as well as Sanskrit</strong>, was produced in the kingdom, with new writing styles and methods emerging.</li>
<li>Vijayanagara architecture is “<strong>a vibrant combination and blossoming of the</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/10/14/chalukya-dynasty/"><strong>Chalukya,</strong></a> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/medieval-indian-history/southern-dynasties/hoysalas/"><strong>Hoysala</strong></a><strong>, Pandya and</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/10/13/the-grandeur-of-the-chola-empire/"><strong>Chola styles</strong></a><strong>,”</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>Prasanna Virupaksha temple of Bukka I and the Hazara Rama temple of Krishna Deva Raya</strong> are striking examples of Vijayanagara’s characteristic style and intricate artistry.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Vijayanagara’s capital</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/02/12/hampi/"><strong>Hampi</strong></a> <strong>is a UNESCO World Heritage Site</strong> known for its sophisticated fortifications as well as innumerable temples and other architectural marvels. From accounts of foreign travellers, by the beginning of the 16th century, <strong>Hampi-Vijayanagara was probably the second-largest urban settlement on the planet (after Beijing)</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>RBI has projected GDP growth for the <strong>next fiscal (FY2024) at 6.4%</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact of raising the Repo rate:</strong></p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Over 43% of the total loans</strong> are linked to the Repo rate and are expected to rise now</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Lower Inflation</strong>: The hike in the Repo rate is expected to help moderate <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-economy-3/inflation/#:~:text=Inflation%20targeting%20is%20a%20monetary,inflation%20target%20to%20the%20public.">inflation</a> in the country as the cost of borrowing will increase and the demand of people will thus decrease.</li>

<p><strong>Reason for RBI’s hawkish stance:</strong> It could be due to its outlook on India’s slower economic growth and higher inflation in 2023-24.</p>
<p>This is box title</p>
<ul>
<li>Monetary policy deals with the <strong>supply and cost of money</strong> in an economy.</li>
<li><strong>The primary objective of the RBI’s monetary policy</strong> is to maintain <strong>price stability</strong> while keeping in mind the <strong>objective of growth</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>The amended</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-economy-3/the-reserve-bank-of-india-and-monetary-management/definition-of-monetary-policy/"><strong>RBI</strong></a> <strong>Act, 1934</strong>provides for the <strong>inflation target (4% +-2%)</strong> to be set by the Government of India, in consultation with the Reserve Bank, <strong>once every five years</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>The latest monetary policy review</strong> was significant because it was made to bring inflation back to the <strong>target level of 4%.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This is box title</p>
<p><strong>As per the Amended (in 2016) RBI Act, 1934</strong>: The central government is empowered to constitute a <strong>six-member Monetary Policy Committee</strong> (MPC) to determine the Policy Rate required to achieve the inflation target”.</p>

<li>Its decisions are <strong>binding</strong> on the Bank.</li>

<p><strong>India’s efforts in pushing millets:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FSSAI</strong>: It will formulate guidelines to include <strong>millets in the food menu of schools, hospitals, and government canteens.</strong></li>
<li><strong>“Millets canteen” to produce millets-based foods (in hospitals)</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Youth Affairs Ministry</strong>: Webinars and conferences with leading athletes, nutritionists, and dieticians on millets through the <strong>Fit India app</strong></li>
<li>Ministry of Food Processing Industries: It has organized <strong>millet fair-cum-exhibition</strong>s in different states.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are the benefits of millet?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Eco-friendly:</strong> They require <strong>much less water than rice or wheat</strong> and can be <strong>grown in rain-fed areas without irrigation</strong>. They belong to the <strong>grass family</strong> &amp; tend to be <strong>more tolerant to drought and extreme weather and can grow in poor soil and hilly areas.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Healthy:</strong> Millets can be a <strong>healthier option to keep lifestyle diseases</strong> such as obesity and diabetes at bay.</li>
<li>Millets have a <strong>much lower glycemic index</strong> — a measure of how much blood sugar levels spike after consuming a food item — than processed rice or wheat.</li>
<li>Millets are also <strong>high in fibre content</strong> which is known to <strong>improve gut microbiota</strong>.</li>
<li>They are <strong>rich in micronutrients such as iron and zinc</strong>, which can help <strong>reduce the country’s burden of anaemia.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Millets also contain niacin,</strong> which is linked to <strong>lowering triglycerides and increasing HDL or good cholesterol.</strong></li>
<li>Millets contain <strong>no gluten and suit people with gluten allergy and irritable bowel syndrome.</strong></li>

<p><strong>GS Paper 3</strong></p>
<p><strong>Syllabus</strong><strong>: Agriculture: Farm Mechanization</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1897076#:~:text=The%20MoS%20said%20that%20the,more%20affordable%20to%20end%20users."><strong>PIB</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context: NCAER</strong> (National Council of Applied Economic Research) has released a report <strong>on “Making India a Global Power House on Farm Machinery Industry”.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The report analyzed the <strong>non-tractor farm machinery industry from both demand and supply side perspectives</strong> and <strong>provides recommendations for reforms based on global practices.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Farm Mechanization:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It refers to the <strong>use of machinery and equipment in</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-economy-3/agriculture/indian-agriculture-in-the-present-times/"><strong>agricultural</strong></a> <strong>operations</strong>. It involves the <strong>integration of various tools and</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/09/24/indian-agri-tech/"><strong>technologies</strong></a> to automate and streamline various farming processes, including <strong>planting, tilling, harvesting, and transporting crops.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key highlights of the report:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Recommends measures and reforms for India to <strong>become a production and export hub for non-tractor farm machinery in the next 15 years.</strong></li>
<li>The farm power availability in India is <strong>much lower compared to other countries like Korea, Japan, and the USA.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Issues with Farm Mechanization:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Power supply:</strong> Availability of adequate <strong>farm power is very crucial</strong> for timely farm operations for increasing production and productivity and reducing losses.</li>
<li><strong>Uneven distribution</strong></li>
<li><strong>A mismatch between the needs</strong> of Indian farmers and what the farm machinery sector is producing.</li>
<li><strong>Banks are reluctant</strong> to lend to farmers.</li>

<p><strong>Direction:</strong> The article highlights how India should use the recent <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/08/turkey-earthquake/">earthquake in Turkey</a> as a lesson and get ready for the future.</p>
<p><strong>Why is Indian terrain prone to great earthquakes?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The political boundaries roughly follow the <strong>tectonic divides</strong> in the west, the north and the east.</li>
<li>The 2,500-km-long <strong>Himalayan</strong> plate boundary from the northwest to the northeast.</li>
<li>The historical release of geological tension doesn’t fully account for the strain that has built up.<ul>
<li><strong>For instance</strong>, the Central Himalayas has been historically deficient in earthquakes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>New dams</strong> at the foothills of the Himalayas.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The trend in annual losses from disasters:</strong> Has been <strong>markedly upward,</strong> mainly due to an <strong>increase in the aerial extent of habitation</strong> in vulnerable areas.</p>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Undertake <strong>a comprehensive study of the vulnerability</strong> of buildings and structures.</li>
<li><strong>To ensur</strong>e –<ul>
<li>All <strong>new</strong> <strong>constructions</strong> (especially in high-risk zones) can resist shaking and</li>
<li>All <strong>existing buildings</strong> are protected by retrofitting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In areas where traditional structures are more common, bolster traditional <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/world-geography/physical-geography-of-the-world/geomorphology/internal-forces-their-impact/earthquakes/earthquake-hazard-mitigation/">earthquake resistance</a></li>
<li><strong>Must overhaul town and municipal planning</strong> by-laws to accommodate hazard-safety measures.</li>
<li>Use the <strong>appropriate building codes</strong>, developed by the Bureau of Indian Standards.</li>
<li><strong>Develop an environmental land zonation scheme</strong> for urban and rural areas.</li>
<li>Translate detailed scientific knowledge on earthquake safety into a format that is easily <strong>available, accessible, and actionable</strong></li>
<li><strong>Real-time and free data-sharing</strong> should become a norm.</li>

<li><strong>The empanelment committee</strong> selects the panel of three officers based on merit.</li>
<li>UPSC shall not put in the panel <strong>any officer with less than 6 months to retirement</strong></li>
<li>DGP should have a fixed tenure of two years in the post, irrespective of retirement date</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>UPSC guidelines on the appointment process:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The list of <strong>eligible officers</strong> must have <strong>at least 30 years of service</strong> and be submitted to the UPSC <strong>six months before the incumbent DGP</strong> is to retire.</li>
<li><strong>The 30-year rule</strong> may be relaxed to 25 years in certain states with the consent of the Centre</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Issue:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The process of appointment has <strong>faced challenges with at least four states</strong> having interim police chiefs and some cases of the Centre not following the Prakash Singh judgment.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Indian government’s <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Disinvestment-in-India.pdf">disinvestment</a> target for <strong>2023-24 is ₹51,000 crore, down 21%</strong> from the previous year and the lowest target in seven years.</p>
<p><strong>Status of</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Disinvestment-in-India.pdf"><strong>disinvestment</strong></a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The government has met its <strong>disinvestment targets only six times</strong> in the last three decades. The last time the government met its target was in <strong>2018-19</strong></li>
<li><strong>In 2021-22,</strong> the government missed its high target of <strong>₹1.75 lakh</strong> crore by a significant margin.</li>
<li><strong>The planned privatisation</strong> of the Shipping Corporation of India, Container Corporation of India, and NMDC Steel are among the state-owned companies that will be divested in 2023-24.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: Disinvestment refers to the sale of government assets or subsidiaries.</p>
<p><strong>Need for disinvestment</strong>: The government may disinvest to reduce fiscal burden, finance the fiscal deficit, or encourage private ownership of assets.</p>

<p><strong>More about Quasicrystals:</strong></p>
<p>It is challenging to create quasicrystals in a laboratory, and the way they form has always been a mystery. Scientists have found natural quasicrystals in three different sources:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Khatyrka meteorite</strong> (found in 2011 in Russia)</li>
<li>In the remains of the <strong>first atomic bomb detonated</strong> (the Trinity test, part of the <strong>Manhattan</strong> <strong>Project</strong>)</li>
<li>In a metallic fragment in the <strong>Sand Hills dunes in northern Nebraska</strong> (USA)</li>
</ul>
<p>These three sources suggest that quasicrystals are formed under <strong>extreme conditions such as high pressure, high temperature, and heavy electric currents</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Usage:</strong> Quasicrystals have been used in surgical instruments, LED lights and nonstick frying pans. They have poor heat conductivity, which makes them good insulators</p>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/business/rbi-announces-pilot-for-qr-code-based-coin-vending-machine/article66484385.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> To improve the distribution of coins, the RBI is preparing a pilot project on QCVM in collaboration with a few leading banks</p>
<p><strong>What is the QCVM?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is a <strong>cashless coin dispenser</strong> that dispenses coins <strong>in exchange for a bank account debit via the</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/12/09/unified-payments-interface-upi-2/"><strong>Unified Payments Interface (UPI).</strong></a></li>
<li>Unlike traditional cash-based Coin Vending Machines, <strong>the QCVM would not require banknote tendering or validation.</strong></li>
<li>This will offer ease and ready access to coins for customers via the UPI facility.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The ongoing <strong>fifth International MPA Congress</strong> discusses solutions to address funding gaps that <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/world-geography/physical-geography-of-the-world/oceanography/coral-reefs/protection-measures-of-coral-reefs/">marine protected areas (MPA</a>) are facing.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nations agreed to protect <strong>30% of the planet’s lands and oceans by 2030</strong> at the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/20/cop15-montreal-3-days-of-ministerial-talks-on-post-2020-gbf-end-with-limited-success/">COP15 to the CBD</a> held in 2022.</li>
<li><strong>70% of MPAs</strong> are underfunded.</li>
<li>Most current MPAs are located in coastal areas, <strong>while only 2% of the high seas are</strong> protected.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MPAs in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>They are regarded as one of the <strong>most potent conservation tools for the</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Marine-Ecological-Crisis.pdf"><strong>protection of marine habitats</strong></a> <strong>and their resources.</strong><ul>
<li>Climate-smart MPAs can shield biota from <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/climate-change-and-associated-issues/">global warming</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are a total of <strong>31 major MPAs in India</strong> (as of Feb 2022) covering coastal areas that have been notified under <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/01/22/environment-ministrys-proposed-changes-to-wildlife-act/"><strong>Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Funding options like <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/02/05/unep50/"><strong>UNEP</strong></a> <strong>FI (Finance Initiative)</strong> can be accessed.</li>
<li><strong>Founded in 1992,</strong> UNEP FI was the first organisation to engage the finance sector on sustainability and incubated the Principles for Responsible Investment.</li>
