<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Government policies and interventions for development in various sectors and issues arising out of their design and implementation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/sc-junks-challenge-to-jk-delimitation-what-did-the-petitioner-centre-argue-8442254/">IE</a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The SC dismissed a plea challenging the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/02/07/delimitation-panel-2/">delimitation exercise</a> to redraw Lok Sabha and Assembly constituencies in the Union Territory of J&amp;K.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/01/why-constitutional-validity-of-jk-reorganisation-act-cause-went-unchallenged-sc/">challenge to the J&amp;K Reorganisation Act, 2019</a>, is pending before the apex court, along with other petitions challenging the abrogation of <strong>Article 370</strong> of the Indian Constitution.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/02/18/delimitation-of-constituencies-2/">Delimitation</a> is the act of redrawing boundaries of an Assembly or LS seat <strong>to represent changes in population over time</strong>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/03/30/delimitation-commission/">A commission</a> set up by the Central government submitted its final report for delimitation in J&amp;K last year.</li>
<li>It has been recommended that the number of seats in the J&amp;K Assembly should be raised <strong>from 83 to 90.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Arguments of the petitioner:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After the notification of the Parliamentary and Assembly Constituencies <strong>Delimitation Order, 2008</strong>, <strong>only the Election Commission of India</strong> could have undertaken the exercise.</li>
<li>The delimitation exercise violates <strong>Article 170 of the Constitution</strong>, under which constituencies shall remain frozen till the first census is conducted after the year 2026.</li>
<li>The increase in seats violates provisions of <strong>Articles 81, 82, 170, 330, and 332</strong> of the Constitution, and Section 63 of the 2019 Act.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Arguments of the Centre:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The J&amp;K Reorganisation Act 2019 mandates the setting up of a commission for the exercise.</li>
</ul>
<p>Delimitation exercise:</p>
<p><strong>Legal/constitutional provisions:</strong></p>
<p>●        <strong>Article 82:</strong> Following each census, the allocation of Lok Sabha seats to the states, as well as the division of each state into territorial constituencies, shall be readjusted by such authority as <strong>Parliament may by law determine.</strong></p>
<p>●        <strong>Section 8A of the</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/governance/elections-in-india/acts-associated-with-elections-in-india/salient-features-of-the-representation-of-peoples-act-1950/">Representation of the People Act, 1950:</a> It allows for delimitation of Parliamentary and Assembly constituencies in Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur or Nagaland.</p>
<p>●        <strong>Article 170</strong> (Composition of the Legislative Assemblies): Census figures (2001) shall be used for the purpose of readjustment of constituencies in the State.</p>
<p>●        <strong>Reservation of seats</strong> for the SCs/STs will be provided as per Articles 330 (Lok Sabha) and 332 (State Assemblies) of the Constitution.</p>
<p><strong>Delimitation Commission:</strong></p>
<p>●        Delimitation is the responsibility of a high-level body known as the Delimitation Commission or a Boundary Commission, whose orders have the force of law and <strong>cannot be challenged in court.</strong></p>
<p>●        <strong>Article 82</strong> of the Indian Constitution provides for the establishment of such a commission through a <strong>Parliamentary act.</strong></p>
<p>●        The orders will take effect on a date to be determined by India’s <strong>President</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong>  NHRC in a recent report flagged the <strong>“inhuman and deplorable</strong>” condition of <strong>all 46 government-run mental healthcare institutions</strong> across the country (3 Central Run and the rest of state-run Institutions)</p>
<p><strong>What is Mental Health?</strong></p>
<p>It is a state of well-being in which every individual realizes his or her own potential, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively, and is able to make a contribution to her or his community. (WHO Definition)</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Mental Healthcare Act, 2017(MHA)</strong> has been called a “<em>watershed moment for the right to health movement in India</em>”. </p>
<p><strong>Provisions of MHA</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It <strong>discourages long-term institutionalization</strong> of patients and reaffirms the rights of people to live independently, and within communities.<ul>
<li>This right is doubly guaranteed under <strong>the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act of 2016</strong></li>
<li>The previous act — <strong>the Mental Healthcare Act, 1987</strong>—<strong>prioritized the long-term institutionalization</strong> of mentally-ill people and provided disproportionate authority to judicial officers and mental health establishments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Attempt to Commit Suicide, not an Offence</strong>: A person who attempts to commit suicide will be presumed to be “<strong>suffering from severe stress’’</strong> and shall not be subjected to any investigation or prosecution.</li>
<li><strong>Promotes community living:</strong> The government was made responsible for <strong>creating opportunities to access less restrictive options</strong> for community living — such as halfway homes, sheltered accommodations, rehab homes, and supported accommodations.</li>
<li><strong>Discourages using physical restraints</strong> (such as chaining), objects to unmodified electro-convulsive therapy (ECT)</li>
<li>Establishment of <strong>Central Mental Health Authority and State Mental Health Authority</strong></li>
<li><strong>It provides the following rights:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Right to Make an Advance Directive</strong> about how to be treated or not to be treated for the illness during a mental health situation.</li>
<li>Right to Appoint a Nominated Representative</li>
<li>Right to access mental health care</li>
<li><strong>It pushes for the rights to hygiene</strong>, sanitation, food, recreation, privacy, and infrastructure.</li>
<li>Right to get free medicines</li>
<li>Right to protection from cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment</li>
<li>Right to live in an environment, safe and hygienic, having basic amenities</li>
<li>Right to legal aid </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are the challenges to the implementation of the Act? (as highlighted by the NHRC report)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Violation of Rights:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Illegal Confinement:</strong> The facilities are “illegally” keeping patients long after their recovery<ul>
<li>NHRC found that <strong>almost 36.25%</strong> of residential service users in state psychiatric facilities were living there for one year or more</li>
<li>It violates <strong>Article 21 of the Constitution</strong> (which protects personal liberty)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Infringement of the human rights</strong> of mentally ill patients</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure issues:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Shortage of facilities:</strong> There are issues of shortage of doctors, lack of infrastructure, lack of community homes, homes for assisted living and socio-economic opportunities</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Procedural Issues:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Non-compliance to MHA regulations</strong> by the institutions</li>
<li>A majority of the States have not established <strong>Central Mental Health Authority and State Mental Health Authority</strong></li>
<li><strong>Many States have not notified minimum standards</strong> which are meant to ensure the quality of MHEs</li>
<li><strong>State Mental Health Authority</strong> – which was required to meet at<strong>least four times</strong> every year, remained inactive <strong>until August 2022</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Societal Issues:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>The social stigma</strong> that looks at a person with mental illness as a “criminal” deserving of incarceration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Poor budgetary allocation</strong>and utilization of funds: It leads to Shelter homes remaining underequipped, understaffed, and undertrained</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Initiatives taken:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Global Initiatives:</strong><ul>

<p><strong>The Central Government:</strong> Issues advisories from time to time and has enacted the Protection of Human Rights Act (PHR), 1993, which stipulates the establishment of the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/statutory-regulatory-and-various-quasi-judicial-bodies/national-human-rights-commission/">NHRC</a> <strong>and SHRCs to look into alleged human rights violations by public servants.</strong></p>
<p><strong>NHRC:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>A magisterial inquiry (within 3 months) in all cases of deaths in the course of police action.</li>
<li>Prompt prosecution and disciplinary action against delinquent officers.</li>
<li>Denial of out-of-turn promotion, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SC (in the PUCL vs State of Maharashtra case 2014):</strong> Laid down <strong>16-point guidelines</strong> for a thorough, effective and independent investigation in the cases of death during police encounters.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of these are – An independent investigation &gt; disciplinary action &gt; <strong>compensation</strong> to be granted to the dependents of the victim.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Amend the Evidence Act to place the onus of proof on the police (Law Commission).</li>
<li><strong>To sensitize public servants</strong> (through NHRC’s workshops, and seminars) for a better understanding of the human rights of persons in custody.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Police and public order are <strong>State subjects as per the</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/functions-and-responsibilities-of-the-union-and-the-states-issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure-devolution-of-powers-and-finances-up-to-local-levels-and-challenges-therein/functions-and-responsibilities-of-the-union-and-the-states/7th-schedule/">7th Schedule</a> of the Indian Constitution. Hence, it is primarily the responsibility of the state government concerned to ensure the protection of persons in custody.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/09/24/insights-into-editorial-sea-level-rise-is-certain/">Sea level rise varies</a> <strong>regionally</strong></li>
<li>It will encroach upon Infrastructure and coastal communities will be encroached upon</li>
<li><strong>It affects a number of major cities on every continent</strong>: Shanghai, Dhaka, Bangkok, Jakarta, Mumbai, Copenhagen, New York, Buenos Aires, Santiago, etc.</li>
<li>Poses a significant <strong>economic, social, and humanitarian problem</strong> (threatens coastal farmlands, water reserves, the resilience of infrastructures, food-nutrition security, human lives and livelihoods), especially in vulnerable areas.</li>
<li>Along with other climate concerns, it will affect coastal ecosystems, related development and <strong>beyond 1 billion people by 2050</strong></li>
<li>Growing <strong>Urbanization</strong> in exposed areas will exacerbate the effects.</li>
<li>It is reinforced by storm surges and tidal variations as seen during the landfall of hurricane <strong>Sandy (New York) and Cyclone Idai (Mozambique)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reasons</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/07/06/mission-2023-mindmap-sea-level-rise/">behind sea-level rise</a><strong>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Increase in average global temperature (by over 1°C since 1880)</li>
<li><strong>Thermal expansion of seawater</strong> (leading to mean sea level increasing by ~20 cm)</li>
<li>Glacier and ice-sheet melt</li>
<li><strong>Changes in groundwater storage.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>According to the IPCC, melting ice sheets (the largest contributor to sea level change) <strong>are hard to predict</strong>.</li>
<li>By 2150, global sea level rise is estimated to rise by roughly <strong>4, 0.5 and 0.2 m</strong> under high, mid and low-emission scenarios, respectively.</li>
<li>Limiting 21st-century global surface temperature rise to 2 °C above the pre-industrial level (<a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/07/08/financial-and-technological-commitments-under-unfccc-and-paris-agreement/">Paris Agreement</a><strong>’s target</strong>) would be insufficient.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A low greenhouse gas emission scenario, with temperatures staying <strong>below 1.5 °C</strong></li>
<li><strong>Reaching net zero carbon emissions before 2060</strong>.</li>
<li>Particularly along the coast, urban systems must enable <strong>climate-resilient development</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="transfer-pricing-rules"><strong>‘Transfer Pricing’ rules</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: The IT Department surveys were conducted at the BBC office, in view of the BBC’s <strong>“deliberate non-compliance with the transfer pricing rules</strong>” and its “vast diversion of profits”</p>
<ul>
<li>BBC has not followed the <strong>“arm’s length arrangement”</strong> in the allocation of profit</li>
<li>Transfer pricing laws in India are codified in the <strong>Income-tax Act, 1961</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is Transfer Pricing?</strong> </p>
<p>Transfer pricing refers to prices of transactions or transfers of goods, services and technology between related enterprises or between unrelated parties but controlled by a common entity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Companies use transfer pricing to <strong>reduce the overall tax burden of the parent company</strong>. The effect of transfer pricing is that the parent company <strong>tends to produce insufficient taxable income</strong> or excessive loss on a transaction. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How does transfer pricing work?</strong></p>
<p>Suppose a company <strong>A purchases goods for 100 rupees</strong> and sells them to its <strong>associated company B</strong> in another country for 200 rupees, who in turn sells in the open market for 400 rupees.</p>
<p>Had A sold it (the good) direct, it would have made a profit of 300 rupees. But by routing it through B, it (A) restricted it (profit) to 100 rupees, permitting B to appropriate the balance. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/transferpricing.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/transferpricing.jpg?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What is the ‘arm’s length price’?</strong></p>
<p>The price at which a <strong>willing buyer and a willing unrelated seller</strong> would freely agree to transact or trade between related parties is conducted as if they were unrelated so that there is no conflict of interest in the transaction. </p>
<p><strong>Difference between an IT Survey and Raid?</strong> </p>
<p>Tax officials during a survey can not remove any cash, stock or other valuable article or thing. During searches or raids, officials can seize accounts or valuable articles.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> India has asked <strong>China to take a haircut on its loans to poor countries</strong> and assist their economic recovery.</p>
<ul>
<li>India has specified that <strong>International Monetary Fund [IMF] taking a haircut</strong> to settle Chinese debt is unsustainable.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is a Haircut in the Economy?</strong> </p>
<p>When a bank or creditor country takes a ‘haircut’, it means <strong>it accepts less than what was due in a particular loan accoun</strong>t. For example: if a bank (e.g. IMF) was owed Rs 10,000 cr by a borrower (e.g. Pakistan) and it agrees to take back only Rs 8,000 cr, it takes a 20% haircut (or loss).</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> A new research suggests that some of the <strong>well-known volatiles, which form the basic part of Earth, may have come from beyond</strong> the inner solar system.</p>
<p><strong>About Volatiles:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Volatiles are elements or compounds that <strong>change from a solid or liquid state into vapour at relatively low temperatures.</strong></li>
<li>The most common volatiles — <strong>carbon dioxide, nitrogen, ammonia, hydrogen, methane, sulphur dioxide, and water</strong>—are abundant in nature and necessary to living organisms.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About the research:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The researchers <strong>examined 18 meteorites</strong> — <strong>eleven from the inner Solar System, known as non-carbonaceous meteorites, and seven from the outer Solar System, known as carbonaceous meteorites.</strong></li>
<li>For each meteorite, they measured the relative abundances of the five different forms — <strong>or isotopes — of zinc.</strong></li>
<li>They then compared each isotopic fingerprint with Earth samples to estimate how much each of these materials contributed to Earth’s zinc inventory. <strong>The results suggest that while the Earth only incorporated about ten per cent of its mass from carbonaceous bodies, this material supplied about half of Earth’s zinc.</strong></li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Central African nation <strong>Equatorial Guinea</strong> confirmed its first outbreak of the highly infectious <strong>Marburg virus disease or MVD.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the Marburg virus disease?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Marburg virus disease is a highly <strong>virulent disease</strong> that causes <strong>haemorrhagic fever</strong>, with a fatality ratio of up to 88 per cent. It is in the same family as <strong>the virus that causes Ebola virus disease.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Symptoms:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Illness caused by the Marburg virus begins abruptly, with <strong>high fever, severe headache, and severe malaise.</strong> Many patients develop <strong>severe haemorrhagic symptoms within seven days.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How does Marburg’s disease spread?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Like <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/02/13/ebola/">Ebola</a>, the Marburg virus is <strong>transmitted to primates from fruit bats</strong>, which are considered natural hosts of the virus.</li>
<li>It spreads <strong>among humans via direct contact with the bodily fluids</strong> of infected bats, or surfaces contaminated with fluids, like bedsheets.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is there any vaccine/treatment for Marburg disease?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There are <strong>no vaccines or antiviral treatments</strong> approved to treat the virus. However, supportive care – <strong>rehydration with oral or intravenous fluids – and treatment of specific symptoms, improve survival.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> A new beetle species ‘<strong>Omorgus Khandesh’</strong> has been discovered in India recently.</p>
<ul>
<li>The beetle is important for forensic science as it <strong>helps detect the time of death of an animal or human.</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Omorgus Khandesh:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Omorgus Khandesh is <strong>necrophagous and is, therefore, also called a keratin beetle</strong>.</li>
<li>The new species belongs to the <strong>Trogidae family</strong>. With the addition of this new species, now there are a <strong>total of 14 extant species of this family in India.</strong></li>
<li>During the decomposition of a body, <strong>blowflies are amongst the first ones to arrive in the early stages</strong>. Meanwhile, the <strong>final successional stage is with the arrival of the keratin feeders</strong>, thus their importance in forensic science.</li>
