<p><strong>Direction:</strong> The article discusses the state of the Indian economy, its future prospects, and its challenges, as highlighted by the Economic Survey 2023.</p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Economic Survey 2023, presented by the Finance Minister in Parliament, <strong>painted an optimistic picture of the Indian economy’s prospects</strong>, claiming that the pandemic-induced blues are over.</p>
<p><strong>What is the Economic Survey?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It provides <strong>a detailed report of the state of the national economy</strong> (from agriculture to unemployment to infrastructure) for the year that is coming to a close (2022-23) with forecasts of the upcoming financial year (2023-24).</li>
<li>It is prepared by the Economic Division of the <strong>Department of Economic Affairs</strong> (DEA), Ministry of Finance, under the guidance of the chief economic adviser (CEA).</li>
<li>Once prepared, the Survey is <strong>approved by the Finance Minister</strong> and the comments or policy solutions contained in the Survey are <strong>not binding</strong> on the government.</li>
<li><strong>The first Economic Survey</strong> was presented for 1950-51 and until 1964, it was presented along with the Budget.</li>

<p><strong>Challenges ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Uncertainty remains:</strong> The Survey signals that vulnerabilities to India’s growth mainly stem from external factors, while domestic drivers remain strong.<ul>
<li><strong>For example</strong>, there are upside risks to commodity prices from external factors such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, China rapidly reopening its economic activity, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>2023 = 2003:</strong> The Survey argued that the situation in 2023 is similar to 2003, as the period between 2014 and 2022 is analogous to 1998-2002 when despite transformative reforms by the government, <strong>the Indian economy lagged in growth returns</strong>.<ul>
<li>This was due to <strong>temporary shocks</strong> such as the US sanctions after India’s nuclear test, two successive droughts, the collapse of the tech boom, etc. But once these shocks faded, the structural reforms paid growth dividends from 2003.</li>
<li>Similarly, the successive shocks in recent years, such as the ILFS collapse, the COVID-19 pandemic, etc., <strong>have led to a lag in the growth effects of sweeping reforms across multiple dimensions</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vigilant on inflation, and deficit:</strong> Monetary and fiscal authorities will need to stay proactive and vigilant on inflation as well as the worsening CAD front, which is facing multiple risks due to slowing exports, rising import bills, etc.</li>
<li><strong>The private sector should take the lead:</strong> Though the fiscal policy has supported public investments for infrastructure projects, the time has probably come for the private sector to take on the baton of contributing to economic growth.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Despite challenges, the Indian economy has almost “recouped” what it lost in 2022–2023 and has “renewed” and “re-energized” what had slowed down due to the pandemic.</p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-3_1"><strong>GS Paper 3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/21st-century-india-needs-a-real-time-fiscal-data-portal-11675100578417.html"><strong>Live Mint</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Former Economic Adviser, Arvind Subramanian, in his book mentioned that the <strong>accounting techniques(‘creative accounting’)</strong> used made it <strong>difficult to gauge the precise extent of the fiscal deficit.</strong></p>
<p>Hence, the government should <strong>make efforts to draft a more transparent and accessible budget for India’s citizens and investors.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Issues with present fiscal data:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Not Comprehensive:</strong> Fiscal data in India is <strong>fragmented, incomplete, and often comes with lags</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Data mismatch:</strong> The data shown in various sources as a <strong>transfer by the higher tier (Union or state government) often does not match the amount shown as receipt by the lower tier (state or local government).</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Need for Real-time fiscal data portal:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A real-time fiscal data portal that tells us how funds are <strong>flowing across the three tiers of government—Centre, state, and local governments</strong>—would be an invaluable resource to understand the Indian economy.</li>
<li>Greater scrutiny of public finances would in turn improve the <strong>quality of reporting, driving up the efficiency of public spending.</strong></li>
<li>Such a portal would also <strong>allow government vendors and related businesses to plan their purchases and inventories better.</strong></li>
<li>Financial institutions would be able to <strong>estimate the borrowing needs of different levels of government accurately.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Committee recommendations that demand a real-time fiscal data portal:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A 2018 committee on fiscal statistics appointed by the <strong>National Statistical Commission (NSC) argued for a complete overhaul of India’s fiscal database.</strong></li>
<li>The committee found that a) <strong>local government accounts were simply unavailable for most states, b) India’s fiscal data lacks compilation, classification into suitable categories, and eventual publication on a website or in printed form.</strong></li>
<li>The report mentions that <strong>as many parts of the financial system have been digitized</strong>, it is possible to build a comprehensive real-time fiscal data warehouse.</li>
<li>A number of Finance Commission reports <strong>have advocated the setting up of an apex fiscal council to aggregate fiscal data</strong>. Such a council can help <strong>clean up public finance statistics and provide a more accurate view of the flow of public funds across the country.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>A federal fiscal organization can help bring about more <strong>consistent reporting standards</strong>. A transparent fiscal data portal that provides granular real-time data can bring <strong>about economy-wide efficiency gains, and pre-empt fiscal crises in the future.</strong></p>
<p><strong>InstaCurious:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Off-Budget financing:</strong> It refers to expenditure that’s not funded through the budget. For instance, the government may set up a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to borrow money for a particular task such as constructing a bridge. Since the loan is not taken directly by the govt, it does not reflect in the budget document. Since such off-budget financing is not mentioned in the Budget document, the numbers also do not reflect in the fiscal deficit. Such financing tends to hide the actual extent of government spending, borrowings, and debt and increase the interest burden.</p>

<p><strong>Rabindra Nath Tagore: “ Let life be beautiful like summer flowers and death be like autumn leaves</strong></p>
<p><strong>Usage:</strong> The quotes can be used to show the continuum of life and death in a philosophical essay. Death is as necessary as life is.  It is said that <strong><em>” Live life so completely that when death comes to you like a thief in the night, there will be nothing left for him to steal</em></strong>. ”These are various perspectives about life and <strong>death.</strong></p>

<h3 id="visakhapatnam-to-be-andhra-pradeshs-new-capital"><strong>Visakhapatnam to be Andhra Pradesh’s new capital</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Source</strong><a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/visakhapatnam-to-soon-become-andhra-pradesh-capital-cm-8415160/">: Indian Express</a></p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: Andhra Pradesh government has announced that <strong>Visakhapatnam</strong> would become the capital of the state soon, even as the <strong>matter of developing Amaravati</strong> as the capital of Andhra Pradesh lies pending in the Supreme Court.</p>
<p><strong>The background of the issue:</strong></p>
<p>In 2019, Jagan Mohan Reddy first proposed the idea of <strong>“decentralized development</strong>” and advocated for the establishment of three capitals in the state- <strong>Amaravati</strong> (Legislative capital); <strong>Visakhapatnam</strong> (Executive Capital), and <strong>Kurnool</strong> (Judicial Capital).</p>
<ul>
<li>However, the state government later changed its views in 2021.</li>
<li>In March 2022, Andhra Pradesh High Court directed the state government to develop the proposed capital <strong>Amaravati</strong>.</li>
<li>Andhra Pradesh government challenged the High Court’s order in the Supreme Court. The SC stayed the HC order and the matter is in SC currently.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act of 2014 (</strong>Telangana Act, on 2nd June 2014) bifurcated the state of Andhra Pradesh into Telangana and the residuary Andhra Pradesh state, as an outcome of the Telangana movement.</p>
<p><strong>Sivaramakrishnan committee</strong> constituted by the Union Government to suggest the place to build the capital city of Andhra Pradesh submitted its report on 27 August 2014 to Home Minister Rajnath Singh in New Delhi.</p>
<ul>
<li>This committee had also opposed creating a <strong>Single ‘Super Capita’ like Amaravati</strong></li>
<li><strong>Insta curious:</strong> 13 countries in the world have more than 1 capital. Example – <strong>South Africa</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Who are High Net Worth Individuals (HNIs)?</strong></p>
<p>Individual investors or institutions (large trusts, big companies, and similar institutions) who are willing to invest more than ₹2 lakh are categorized as High Net Worth Individuals.</p>
<p><strong>What is an FPO?</strong></p>
<p>FPO (Follow on Public Offer) is a process by which a company, which is already listed on an exchange, issues new shares to the investors or the existing shareholders, usually the promoters</p>
<p><strong>What is FPO oversubscription?</strong></p>
<p>An FPO oversubscription is a condition when an FPO receives more applications from investors than the total number of shares offered. For example, Adani’s FPO was oversubscribed <strong>1.12 times</strong>, meaning there were 112 interested investors for 100 shares of the company.</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: In its recent update of the <strong>World Economic Outlook (WEO) report</strong>, the <strong>IMF has marginally improved the forecast for global growth in 2023</strong> — a relief, given the fears of a global recession in 2023.</p>
<p>The IMF releases the <strong>WEO twice every yea</strong>r, in April and October, <strong>apart from updating it twice — in January and July.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Global growth will bottom out in 2023</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>IMF rules out a global recession: “<strong>Negative growth in global GDP or global GDP per capita—which often happens when there is a global recession—is not expected</strong>.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Global inflation has peaked but relief will be slow</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Inflation, which destabilized the global economy, is expected to have <strong>peaked in 2022 but the disinflation (the fall in inflation rate) will be slow and take all of 2023 and 2024.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The price rise is slowing for two main reasons</strong>. One is <strong>monetary tightening all across the world</strong> — higher interest rates reduce overall demand for goods and services and that, in turn, slows down inflation. Two, in the <strong>wake of faltering demand, prices of different commodities — both fuel and non-fuel — have come down from their recent highs</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>India will stay the world’s fastest-growing major economy in 2023 and 2024</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>India’s GDP growth rate is <strong>expected to be significantly higher than all its comparable economies, especially China (which is set to grow at 5.4% in 2023 and 4.5% in 2024).</strong></li>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: An international team of scientists has made a breakthrough in <strong>retaining the quantum coherence of quantum dot spin qubits</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The research has improved the storage of quantum information beyond <strong>hundreds of microseconds.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The issues with quantum coherence:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Quantum coherence</strong> refers to the ability of a quantum state to maintain its entanglement and superposition in the face of interactions. Quantum dots are needed for the <strong>storage of information</strong> and for its transmission to <strong>longer distances. Spin-photon allows</strong> it to do so. However, extending its storage time beyond a few microseconds has puzzled physicists.</p>
<p><strong>Significance of the breakthrough:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It will enable <strong>practical quantum networks and quantum computers</strong></li>
<li>The technologies will alter a wide range of enterprises and research initiatives, from information security to the search for novel materials and chemicals, to measurements of sensors</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are Quantum dots?</strong></p>
<p>Quantum dots <strong>are tiny particles or nanocrystals of a semiconducting material</strong> with diameters in the range of 2-10 nanometers (10-50 atoms). They are used for LEDs, displays, and various other applications (see the below image)</p>

<p><strong>What is Quantum technology?</strong> </p>
<p>Until the early 20th century, it was thought that classical physics – two objects cannot occupy the same space at the same moment. However, the <strong>principles of quantum mechanics allow</strong> it, and quantum technologies are based on it. It is exhibited by <strong>microscopic particles</strong> (photons, electrons, atoms, etc).</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Scientists have discovered the <strong>first gamma-ray eclipses</strong> from a special type of binary star system using data from <strong>NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>These so-called <strong>spider systems each contain a pulsar</strong> – the superdense, rapidly rotating remains of a star that exploded in a supernova – that slowly erodes its companion.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Spider systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Spider systems <strong>develop because one star in a binary evolves more swiftly than its partner</strong>. When the <strong>more massive star goes supernova, it leaves behind a pulsar</strong>. This stellar remnant emits beams of multiwavelength light, including gamma rays, that sweep in and out of our view, creating pulses so regular they rival the precision of atomic clocks.</li>
<li>Early on, a <strong>spider pulsar “feeds” off its companion by siphoning away a stream of gas</strong>. As the system evolves, the feeding stops as the pulsar begins to spin more rapidly, generating <strong>particle outflows and radiation that superheat</strong> the companion’s facing side and erode it.</li>
<li>Scientists divide spider systems into two types named after <strong>spider species whose females sometimes eat their smaller mates.</strong> <strong>Black widows</strong> contain companions with <strong>less than 5% of the Sun’s mass</strong>. <strong>Redback systems host bigger companions</strong>, both in size and mass, weighing <strong>between 10% and 50% of the Sun.</strong></li>
<li>One of the most important goals for studying spiders is to <strong>try to measure the masses of the pulsars</strong></li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Researchers have unearthed a <strong>“strikingly colorful” new genus of wasp from the forests of Biligiri Rangana Hills in Karnataka</strong> and other locations.</p>
<p><strong>About Soliga ecarinata</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The wasp has been named <strong>‘Soliga ecarinata’ after the indigenous community that resides in BR Hills and Male Mahadeshwara Hills in Chamarajanagar.</strong></li>
<li>The wasp belongs to the subfamily <strong>Metopiinae of the Darwin wasps family Ichneumonidae.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Metopiinae has 862 species across 27 genera</strong>, most of which are seen only in the <strong>Palaearctic, Neotropical, and Nearctic regions.</strong></li>
<li>The species’ name ‘ecarinata’ denotes the absence of ridges in some of its body regions.</li>
<li>The entomologists described the insect as “<strong>strikingly colorful and distinct from all its relatives”.</strong> </li>
