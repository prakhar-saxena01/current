<p><strong>Concerns:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A disconnect</strong> between the speeches in the parliamentary record and the publicly available version online.</li>
<li>It also means that every individual (including MPs) who shared the speech as was delivered by an MP on the floor of the House is in <strong>breach of the privilege of Parliament.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/parliament-and-state-legislatures/">The Parliament</a> is the “<strong>platform to fix the accountability of the Executive</strong>” and criticism of the government amounts neither to an allegation against an individual Member nor to an attack on the dignity of the House/s.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> To make Indian cities smarter, <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/07/14/the-scale-of-municipal-finances-is-inadequate/">the health of municipal finances</a> must be improved.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> The WB suggests that India will need to <strong>invest approximately $840 billion</strong> in <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-economy-3/infrastructure/urban-infrastructure/">urban infrastructure</a> over the next 15 years.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/central_gov.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/central_gov.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/08/municipal-mess-from-mcd-to-bmc-paralysis-of-urban-local-bodies-undermines-local-governance-and-democracy/"><strong>The health of municipal finances in India</strong></a><strong>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Urban local bodies’ (ULBs) <strong>own revenue is only 47%</strong> of their total revenue and the <strong>property tax accounts for approximately 29%</strong> of it.<ul>
<li>As per the RBI, at least <strong>141 municipal corporations</strong> (in FY21) saw a sharp decline in revenue (by more than 25%) or a significant increase in expenditure (by over 75%).</li>
<li>There was a decline in projected growth in <strong>property tax.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>GST implementation and the pandemic</strong> added to these revenue losses.</li>
<li><strong>Disbursal of external grants</strong> from the state and Centre is a concern. The CAG’s performance audit (2020) noted a saving of Rs 5,000 crore due to the non-disbursal of grants in Karnataka.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact of shortfall in revenue:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cuts in essential services</strong> – for example, sewerage services were affected.</li>
<li><strong>Delayed salary and pension disbursements</strong>. For example, 18,000 primary school teachers under the DMC are yet to receive their past few month’s salaries.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead – A multi-pronged strategy to bridge the gap:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Many ULBs and municipal corporations need a <strong>fiscal stimulus.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Additional funding needs to be explored.</strong> For example,<ul>
<li>A revolving fund along with an overdraft facility when revenues and fiscal transfers are delayed.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/02/07/green-bonds-4/"><strong>Green bonds</strong></a> along with a joint corpus funded by the Centre and states.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rationalisation of property tax.</strong> Updating existing databases, reassessing properties using digital tools and imposing taxes on non-compliers and defaulters.</li>
<li><strong>Concessions</strong> (free water and electricity) will need to be rationalised.</li>
<li><strong>Expenditure efficiency needs to be boosted</strong> by pushing for outsourcing (for garbage services) and exploring PPP models <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2018/11/17/4-critically-analyze-the-hybrid-annuity-model-which-has-recently-found-favour-with-the-government-for-road-construction250-words/">(hybrid annuity models</a>) <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/03/04/explain-the-concept-of-participatory-budgeting-also-discuss-its-relevance-in-budgeting-of-local-self-government-in-india/">and participatory budgeting</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Performance-linked incentives.</strong> For example, the Centre’s incentives to states to cover aspects like framing building bylaws, pushing for public transport, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Innovative financing mechanisms</strong> can be pursued. For example, asset monetisation, financing from carbon credit generation, etc.</li>
<li><strong>A push for user charges</strong> (levies like betterment, impact fees and tax increment financing should be explored) for public service delivery.</li>
<li>States and the Centre must ensure that disbursements are made on time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Some best practices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2017/02/16/insights-editorial-using-municipal-bonds-bolster-city-finances/"><strong>Municipal bonds</strong></a>: Municipal corporations have raised over Rs 6,250 crore since 2017.</li>
<li><strong>Tamil Nadu’s municipalities</strong> are utilising pooled finance and aggregating funds to raise funds from the market for multiple projects.</li>
<li><strong>Maharashtra</strong> seeks to implement land value capture in a range of forms, with municipalities charging property owners for a specific project.</li>
<li><strong>Gujarat</strong> offers an interesting example in land pooling systems – any increase in land value due to public investment or civic initiatives is taxed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Unlocking <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/welfare-schemes/schemes-under-ministry-of-housing-and-urban-affairs/smart-cities-mission-scm/">smart cities</a> will require rethinking urban financing.</p>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/explained-how-is-govt-ramping-up-border-infrastructure/article66498281.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> According to India’s External Affairs Minister, the government’s recent <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/09/02/elaborate-on-the-components-of-border-infrastructure-examine-what-is-the-state-of-border-infrastructure-in-india/">border infrastructure</a> projects focus on the north and east along India’s 3,488 km border with China (or LAC).</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reports claim that <strong>Indian forces have lost access to 26 of 65 patrolling points</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/07/08/in-bali-meeting-with-wang-jaishankar-raises-lac-issues/"><strong>along the LAC</strong></a> <strong>since 2020.</strong></li>
<li>The timing is crucial because of the upcoming meetings of the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/11/17/as-india-takes-g20-presidency-key-takeaways-from-the-summit-in-bali/">G-20</a> Foreign Ministers and the Foreign Ministers of <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/09/07/shanghai-cooperation-organisation-sco/">the SCO</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About the projects:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ramping up infrastructure in Ladakh, HP, UK, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh.</strong><ul>
<li>Many of these projects which have been in the pipeline for several decades have been expedited.</li>
<li><strong>For example</strong>, the length of roads constructed in the China border areas (6,806 km between 2014 to 2022) is almost double the length constructed from 2008-2014.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Projects connecting India to “friendly” neighbouring states</strong> such as Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and Myanmar.<ul>
<li>Improving cross-border connectivity via highways, bridges, inland waterways, railroads, electricity lines and fuel pipelines.</li>
<li>Modernising and constructing i<strong>ntegrated check posts</strong> (ICPs) at all the border crossings to smooth trade.</li>
<li><strong>Funding and constructing infrastructure projects</strong>. For example,<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2022/feb/01/bridge-over-mahakali-river-to-strengthen-relation-with-india-nepal-transport-minister-2414049.html">Mahakali motorable bridge</a> and the <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pm-modi-inaugurates-maitri-setu-between-india-and-bangladesh/article34026410.ece"><strong>Maitri</strong> Setu</a> between Tripura and Bangladesh,</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/03/18/kaladan-project/"><strong>Kaladan</strong> Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project</a> (KMTTP),</li>
<li>The <strong>Sittwe</strong> port project and the road to Mizoram, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Need for ramping up the border infrastructure:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strategic reasons:</strong> Successive skirmishes with the Chinese PLA in Chumar in 2014, <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/07/07/lesson-from-doklam-no-de-escalation-until-full-return-of-status-quo/">Doklam</a> in 2017, and the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/06/18/india-china-galwan-valley-standoff/">Galwan clashes in 2020</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Border preparedness:</strong> To update the quality of structures, the technology involved and their maintenance.</li>

<p><strong>Example 1: Justice S. Abdul Nazeer</strong></p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: He is a retired Supreme Court judge who recently became the Governor of Andhra Pradesh. </p>
<p><strong>Ethical learnings from his life:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hard work and determination</strong>: He started his life in difficult circumstances, even scavenging for fish to supplement his family’s income.<ul>
<li>He went on to become a successful lawyer and judge, demonstrating the importance of <strong>hard work and determination.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Perseverance</strong>: He compared it to the <strong>“duck syndrome</strong>,” with him paddling hard under the water to keep himself afloat.</li>
<li><strong>Respect for elders and sacrifices of parents</strong>: Justice Nazeer has spoken about the sacrifices of his mother for the family and has shown respect for his elders.</li>
<li><strong>Openness to diversity and inclusive mindset</strong>: Justice Nazeer has learned Sanskrit, demonstrates a diversity of interests and has an open mind.<ul>
<li>This teaches us the <strong>importance of being open to different cultures, traditions</strong> and perspectives.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ethical decision-making</strong>: As a judge, Justice Nazeer stood for what is right and placed the nation first.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ethical Issues with his appointment as Governor (after he retired from being SC judge)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Potential to raise questions about the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/07/23/independence-of-the-judiciary/#:~:text=The%20judicial%20independence%20ensures%20public%20confidence%20as%20an,of%20any%20kind%20of%20misconduct%20by%20the%20executive."><strong>independence of the judiciary</strong></a> and the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/separation-of-powers-between-various-organs-dispute-redressal-mechanisms-and-institutions/separation-of-powers-between-various-organs/"><strong>separation of powers</strong></a> between the branches of government</li>
<li>It undermines the <strong>impartiality</strong> of the judiciary and <strong>erodes the public’s trust</strong> in the justice system.</li>
<li>Gives an image of <strong>the quid pro quo</strong> between executive and judiciary</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Counterview</strong>: However, It is important to note that the appointment of judges as governors is not uncommon in India and in many other countries. In such cases, the individual must maintain their <strong>impartiality and avoid any actions</strong> that could be perceived as compromising the independence of the judiciary. </p>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Recently a Gurgaon couple have been arrested for brutally torturing their 17-year-old domestic help.</p>
<ul>
<li>Union Minister of Tribal Affairs has said <em>“<strong>Such barbaric acts in a civilised society are not only unfortunate but also a question of humanity</strong>”.</em> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ethical issues concerned in the case:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Human Rights Violation</strong>: The minor girl was subjected to torture, physical abuse, and exploitation by her employers.</li>
<li><strong>Child Abuse</strong></li>
<li><strong>Failure of the System</strong>: The minor girl was rescued only after someone tipped off the authorities</li>
<li><strong>Discrimination based on Caste and Tribe:</strong> The girl is from a Scheduled Tribe.</li>
<li><strong>Inadequate Support</strong> and Protection Mechanisms</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example 3: Journalist Shashikant Warishe</strong></p>
<p><strong>Shashikant Warishe,</strong> a 48-year-old journalist from the Rajapur area of Ratnagiri district in Maharashtra, died after being mowed down by a person against whom Warishe had written an article.</p>
<p><strong>Ethical issues related to the case:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/07/editorial-analysis-the-freedom-of-speech-and-an-adolescent-india/"><strong>Freedom of speech and expression</strong></a>: The journalist Shashikant Warishe was killed because of the articles he wrote (being critical of the government’s proposed Ratnagiri refinery project).</li>
<li><strong>Violence against journalists</strong></li>
<li><strong>Environmental concerns:</strong> Warishe was covering the issues about pollution and land acquisition from the proposed refinery, which highlights the importance of responsible reporting on environmental issues.</li>
<li><strong>Human rights violations</strong></li>
<li><strong>Responsibility of the government</strong>: It is the government’s responsibility to ensure the <strong>safety of journalists</strong> and to hold those who violate their rights accountable.</li>

<p><strong>The Delhi State Legal Services Authority (DSLSA</strong>) held the <strong>first National</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/09/25/lok-adalat/"><strong>Lok Adalat</strong></a> in Delhi’s trial courts this year. This year, the DSLSA included people from <strong>disenfranchised communities,</strong> trans people, and acid attack survivors as associate members, who help a judge settle cases.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Lok Adalat is an alternative dispute resolution</strong> forum where cases pending in court or at the pre-litigation stage can be settled amicably.</li>
<li>Previously in <strong>December 2022, after the Bombay HC order</strong>, the <strong>Maharashtra</strong> government had allowed police recruitment applications for <strong>third-gender candidates.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Usage of the example</strong>: It can be used for showing the judiciary as an inclusive platform to make marginalized communities visible and break away from negative stereotypes</p>

<p><strong>Reasons cited by the SC</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/01/06/judicial-review/">Judicial Review</a> of the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/05/10/what-is-the-collegium-system-and-how-it-works/">Collegium</a> decision <strong>violates the law as declared</strong>, as it would amount to <strong>evaluating and substituting</strong> the decision of the Collegium, with an <strong>individual or personal opinion</strong> on the suitability and merits of the person</p>
<p><strong>About JR:</strong></p>
<p>Judicial review in India refers to the <strong>power of the Indian courts (SC or HC)</strong> to review and <strong>potentially invalidate laws</strong> and governmental actions that conflict with the Constitution of India.</p>
<ul>
<li>The power of judicial review in India is derived from the <strong>principle of the rule of law</strong> and the <strong>idea that the Constitution</strong> is the supreme law of the land.</li>
<li>In India, the <strong>power of judicial review</strong> is exercised through <strong>writ petitions</strong></li>
<li><strong>Article 13</strong> expressively provides for the doctrine of JR</li>
<li>Indian Constitution provides for <strong>‘Procedure established by law’</strong> (narrower JR power) against the American Constitution which provides for <strong>‘Due process of Law’</strong> (broader interpretation of JR)</li>
