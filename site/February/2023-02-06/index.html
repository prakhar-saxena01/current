<h4 id="gs-paper-1"><strong>GS Paper 1</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Post-independence Consolidation and Reorganisation within the country</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/supreme-court-income-tax-order-on-sikkim-and-the-protests-it-has-triggered-8422930/"><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Direction:</strong> The article highlights Section 10(26AAA) of the IT Act 1961 and how it <strong>discriminates against women and outside Indians in Sikkim</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>According to the CM of Sikkim, <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/09/01/what-is-a-review-petition-2/">a <strong>review petition</strong></a> has been filed in the Supreme Court for rectification of the court’s observation on Sikkimese Nepalis.</li>
<li>Political parties in Sikkim have voiced opposition to the court’s finding that <strong>Sikkimese Nepalis are immigrants</strong> while granting income tax exemption (under Section 10(26AAA) of the IT Act 1961) to all long-term settlers regardless of ethnicity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Section 10 (26AAA)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The objective behind the section is t<strong>o reduce the taxpayer’s burden by providing exemptions.</strong></li>
<li>This section describes the income that does not form a part of the total income while calculating the tax for an individual/ <strong>exempted income</strong>.</li>
<li>It was inserted <strong>into the IT Act 1961 by the Finance Act 2008</strong> with retrospective effect from April 1, 1990, the date on which the IT Act was made applicable in Sikkim.</li>
<li>Before 1990, the <strong>Sikkim Income Tax Manual</strong> (SITM), promulgated by the Ruler of Sikkim or Chogya in 1948, was applicable.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why was it challenged?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The petitioners challenged the –<ul>
<li><strong>Proviso</strong> (a condition) <strong>excluding Sikkimese women</strong> married to non-Sikkimese men from the benefit of tax exemption.</li>
<li><strong>Explanation</strong>, which elaborated on the type of income falling under the category, along with a <strong>definition</strong> of ‘Sikkimese’</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Under the Explanation to Section 10 (26AAA), <strong>the definition of ‘Sikkimese’ is confined to</strong> –<ul>
<li>Individuals whose name is recorded in the <strong>register</strong> maintained under the Sikkim Subjects Regulation 1961, immediately before the 26th day of April 1975;</li>
<li>Individuals whose names were included in the Register of Sikkim Subjects by virtue of Government of India Orders 1990 and 1991; and</li>
<li><strong>Any individua</strong>l whose name does not appear in the Register, but the name of such individual’s father/husband, etc., has been in the register.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Association of the Old Settlers of Sikkim <strong>challenged the constitutional validity of the</strong> <strong>definition</strong>, as it excluded Indians (from tax exemption benefits) who settled in Sikkim before April 26, 1975 – the day Parliament approved the merger of Sikkim with India.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the SC’s ruling?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The benefit of tax exemption provided in Section 10 (26AAA) <strong>shall be extended to all Indian citizens</strong> domiciled in Sikkim on or before April 26, 1975.</li>
<li><strong>The court struck down</strong> the provision excluding Sikkimese women <strong>as violative of</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/indian-constitution/significant-provisions/fundamental-rights/fundamental-rights-articles-12-35/rights-to-equality/"><strong>Articles 14, 15</strong></a><strong>,</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/indian-constitution/significant-provisions/fundamental-rights/fundamental-rights-articles-12-35/rights-to-equality/"><strong>and 21</strong></a> of the Constitution.</li>
<li>A <strong>woman is not a commodity</strong> and has an identity of her own that cannot be taken away by marriage.<ul>
<li>This is in line with what the SC had earlier ruled in <strong>Sekar vs. Geetha &amp; Ors</strong> (2009).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The court’s observations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Under <strong>the Sikkim Income Tax Manual 1948</strong>, all persons engaged in business were subjected to tax irrespective of their origin.</li>
<li>Therefore, there was <strong>no difference made out</strong> between the original inhabitants of Sikkim (the <strong>Bhutia-Lepchas)</strong> and the <strong>persons of foreign origin</strong> who settled in Sikkim (Nepalis) or <strong>persons of Indian origin</strong> who had settled down in Sikkim generations back.</li>
<li>The judgement also recorded that the “Nepalese migrants”, were benefiting from <strong>Section 10(26AAA) of the IT Act 1961</strong>, while arbitrarily excluding settlers of Indian origin.</li>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: This year, the court is hosting the <strong>first-ever celebration of its anniversary</strong> with Singapore Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon as chief guest. The Supreme Court was established on <strong>January 28, 1950</strong>, two days after the Constitution.</p>
<p><strong>A brief overview of</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/structure-organization-and-functioning-of-the/judiciary/sc/"><strong>India’s Supreme court</strong></a><strong>:</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Court of India is the <strong>highest judicial body</strong> in the country and was established in 1950 after India gained independence from British rule. It evolved from the Federal Court of India, which was established in 1937.</p>

<p><strong>How has the</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/structure-organization-and-functioning-of-the/judiciary/sc/"><strong>Supreme Court</strong></a> <strong>changed over the years?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The number of judges</strong>: The original Constitution <strong>envisaged a Supreme Court</strong>with a Chief Justice and <strong>7 puisne judges</strong> – leaving it to Parliament to increase this number.<ul>
<li>Currently, there are <strong>32 judges</strong>(including the Chief Justice) (maximum possible strength is 34)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Sittings</strong>: In the early years, all the judges of the Supreme Court sat together to hear the cases presented before them.<ul>
<li>As the number of cases has increased, <strong>the SC sit in smaller benches of two and three</strong>– coming together in <strong>larger benches of 5 and more</strong> only when required to do so.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Expansion of its jurisdiction</strong>: Over the years, the Supreme Court has expanded its jurisdiction, taking on an increasingly active role in <strong>public interest litigation and providing judicial remedies</strong> for a wide range of social and economic issues.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance of SC:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Final appellate court</strong></li>
<li><strong>Defender of the Constitution</strong>: The Supreme Court is the ultimate interpreter of the Indian Constitution</li>
<li><strong>Leader in the development of</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Public-Interest-Litigation-PIL.pdf"><strong>public interest litigation</strong></a> in India, allowing citizens to bring cases to the court to address issues of public concern.</li>
<li><strong>Political Stability</strong>: It serves as a <strong>check on the power of the government and other institutions,</strong> helping to ensure political stability and the rule of law in the country</li>
<li><strong>Defender of rights:</strong> It has also established itself as a defender of the rights of marginalized groups, including women, children, and religious and ethnic minorities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Limitations of SC:</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/19/editorial-analysis-indias-crushing-court-backlogs-out-of-the-box-reform/">Case backlog</a>, <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/05/sansad-tv-perspective-justice-delivery-system/#:~:text=Shortage%20of%20judges%3A%20around%2035,recommended%2050%20judges%20per%20million.">shortage of judges</a>, staff, and funding, Political pressure, and Difficulty in enforcing judgments.</p>
<p>Top of Form</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Today, the Supreme Court of India continues to play a vital role in the development of Indian law and the protection of human rights. It remains one of the most respected and influential courts in the world.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In the Union Budget for 2023-24, the Finance Minister chose the path of <strong>relative fiscal prudence and projected a decline in</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-economy-3/fiscal-policy/deficit/types-of-deficit/#:~:text=Fiscal%20deficit%20indicates%20the%20additional,interest%20payment%20and%20loan%20repayment."><strong>fiscal deficit</strong></a> <strong>to 5.9%</strong> of GDP in FY24, compared with 6.4% in FY23.</li>
<li>The government is planning to continue on the path of <strong>fiscal consolidation</strong> (reducing deficits) <strong>and reach a fiscal deficit below 4.5% by 2025-26.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/deficits.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/deficits.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>The Union Budget 2023-24:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Different deficits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The fiscal deficit (FD) is pegged at <strong>5.</strong><strong>9%</strong> of GDP in FY24, down from <strong>6.4%</strong> in 2022-23 (Revised Estimates – RE) and 6.7% in 2021-22 (actual).<ul>
<li>To finance the FD in 2023-24, the net market borrowings from <strong>dated securities</strong> are estimated at ₹11.8 lakh crore.</li>
<li>The balance financing is expected to come from <strong>small savings and other sources</strong> and gross market borrowings are estimated at <strong>₹15.4 lakh crore</strong>.</li>
<li>It is also stated that the <strong>states</strong> will have to maintain a fiscal deficit of 3.5% of GSDP of which <strong>0.</strong><strong>5%</strong> will be tied to power sector reforms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <strong>revenue deficit</strong> is pegged at 2.9% of GDP, down from 4.1% of GDP in 2022-23 (RE).</li>
<li>The <strong>primary deficit</strong> is pegged at 2.3% of GDP, down from 3% of GDP in 2022-23 (RE).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>External debt:</strong> India’s external debt is pegged at ₹22,118 crore of the total fiscal deficit of ₹17,86,816 crore in 2023-24 (Budget estimate – BE), which is approximately about 1%.</p>
<p><strong>Fiscal consolidation – Lowering food, fertiliser and petroleum subsidies</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The food subsidy has been reduced to ₹1,97,350 crore (BE) (from ₹2,87,194 crore in 2022-23 (RE)).</li>
<li>The fertiliser subsidy has been reduced to ₹1,75,100 crore for FY24 (from ₹2,25,220 crore (RE)).</li>
<li>The petroleum subsidy has declined to ₹2,257 crore in 2023-24 (from ₹9,171 crore (RE)).</li>
<li><strong>The rationalisation of subsidies is important</strong> so that the government can move towards reaching a fiscal deficit target of 4.5% by 2025-26.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What needs to be done for reviving growth?</strong></p>

<li>Also, a high-interest rate regime can hurt the economic growth process.</li>
<li>Therefore, <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-economy-3/fiscal-policy/deficit/types-of-deficit/"><strong>fiscal policy</strong></a> <strong>measures are crucial to tackling mounting inflation.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal policy needs to remain “accommodative”:</strong><ul>
<li>This will go along with a focus on <strong>gross capital formation</strong> in the economy with enhanced capital spending, especially infrastructure investment.</li>
<li>In Budget 23-24, capital spending is expected to rise to 3.3% of GDP.</li>
<li>Infrastructure investment has a larger <strong>multiplier effect</strong> on economic growth and employment.</li>
<li><strong>The interest-free loan</strong> of ₹1.3 lakh crore for 50 years provided to States should help them spend and boost growth.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Policy coordination:</strong> Between RBI and the govt. is crucial for a sustained growth recovery process.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Can the govt. stick to fiscal consolidation?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>According to Moody, <strong>the ambitious goal to reduce the deficit to 4.5% of GDP by FY26 is unlikely to be me</strong>t, even when ongoing-gradual fiscal consolidation helps to stabilise the government’s debt burden and protects credit quality.</li>
<li>According to Fitch Ratings, the slow fiscal consolidation process in the wake of the pandemic <strong>could leave public finances exposed</strong> in the event of further major economic shocks – geopolitical risks, mounting inflation, energy price volatility, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What lies ahead?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Finance Minister is focusing on <strong>economic growth recovery through capex,</strong> as the <strong>infrastructure investment will boost private investment</strong>.</li>
<li>In the fiscal deficit-GDP ratio, if the denominator GDP expands, it will reduce the overall fiscal deficit-GDP ratio.</li>
<li>So the government is trying to maintain a <strong>Goldilocks balance</strong> (whereby the economy is not expanding/contracting by too much) between fiscal consolidation (reducing deficits) and economic growth recovery.</li>

<p><strong>Direction:</strong> We had already covered <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/12/generative-ai/">Generative AI previously</a>; the points given here are only the unique points that we didn’t cover previously.</p>
<p><strong>What is Generative AI:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Generative Artificial Intelligence refers to the <strong>capability of artificial intelligence-enabled machines to use existing text, audio files, or images to create new content.</strong></li>
<li>The software uses <strong>complex machine learning models to predict the next word based on previous word sequences, or the next image based on words describing previous images</strong>. “<strong>Large language model”</strong> – LLMs began at Google Brain in 2017, where they were initially used for the translation of words while preserving context.</li>
<li>Since then, <strong>large language and text-to-image models</strong> have proliferated at leading tech firms including <strong>Google (BERT and LaMDA), Facebook (OPT-175B, BlenderBot), and OpenAI, a nonprofit in which Microsoft is the dominant investor (GPT-3 for text, DALL-E2 for images, and Whisper for speech).</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefits of Generative AI:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automated content generation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Improved content quality</strong></li>
<li><strong>Increased content variety</strong></li>
<li><strong>Personalized content</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Generative Adversarial Network:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/AI_6.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/AI_6.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p>A generative adversarial network (GAN) is a <strong>machine learning (ML) model</strong> in which two <strong>neural networks compete with each other</strong> to become more accurate in their predictions. GANs typically run <strong>unsupervised and use a cooperative zero-sum game framework to learn.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/03/19/insights-into-editorial-responsible-ai-the-need-for-ethical-guard-rails/"><strong>Ethical concerns</strong></a> <strong>associated with Generative AI:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bias and Discrimination</strong>: AI models can perpetuate and amplify biases in their training data, leading to <strong>discriminatory outcomes and unjust decisions</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Responsibility and accountability</strong></li>
<li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Generative AI models have the <strong>potential to collect and generate vast amounts of personal data, which can raise privacy concerns.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ownership and control</strong></li>
<li><strong>Fairness and transparency</strong>: AI models can make decisions <strong>that lack transparency and fairness</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Job displacement</strong></li>
<li><strong>Misuse</strong>: AI models can be used for <strong>malicious purposes,</strong> such as <strong>creating fake news or deep fakes, or spreading hate speech.</strong></li>

<p><strong>Indian Initiatives for Generative AI:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Government has published the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/National-Strategy-for-Artificial-Intelligence-AI.pdf"><strong>National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence</strong></a> with the objective of <strong>developing an ecosystem for the research and adoption of</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/science-technology/robotics/artificial-intelligence-and-robotics/"><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong></a></li>
<li>Subsequently with a vision <strong>to ‘Make AI in India and Make AI work for India’,</strong> MeitY has approved the implementation of the <strong>‘National Program on Artificial Intelligence’</strong> for the development of AI-based solutions and ensure responsible and transformational use of <strong>#AI for All</strong>.</li>

<ul>
<li>Mangroves are <strong>salt-tolerant plant communities</strong> found in <strong>tropical and subtropical intertidal regions.</strong> They are <strong>important refuges of coastal biodiversity</strong> and act as <strong>bio-shields against extreme climatic events.</strong> </li>
<li>They are located in the intermediate zone between the land and the sea and <strong>represent one of the best examples of ecotone.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Threats to mangroves:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deforestation: Agriculture and aquaculture</strong>, <strong>urban development, and harvesting</strong>have caused the loss of more than a quarter of mangrove forests.</li>
<li><strong>Land reclamation for agriculture and industrial activities</strong> has occurred in areas, which are under the <strong>Coastal Regulation Zone.</strong></li>
<li>Increasing <strong>population in coastal areas</strong></li>

<p><strong>The issue with the</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/12/15/beyond-ops-vs-nps-the-question-of-indias-broken-pension-system/"><strong>New Pension Scheme</strong></a>: Employees who joined service post January 2004, and are part of the New Pension System have their contributions defined, but benefits depend on the market.</p>
<ul>
<li>On the other hand, the old pension scheme is <strong>fiscally unsustainable</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In the Andhra Pradesh model</strong>: This model is it combines the elements of both the OPS (defined benefit) and the NPS (defined contribution). It gives two options to employees:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Option 1</strong>: Employees can get a <strong>guaranteed pension of 33 per cent</strong> of their last drawn salary if they contribute <strong>10 per cent of their basic salary</strong> every month which is matched by a 10 per cent contribution by the state government.</li>
<li><strong>Option 2:</strong> Employees can get a <strong>guaranteed pension of 40 per cent</strong> of their last drawn salary if they are willing to <strong>contribute a higher 14 per cent</strong> of their salary every month, which will be matched by a 14 per cent government contribution.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Usage:</strong> This can be used as an example in governance questions to give a solution to the Old Pension Vs New Pension debate</p>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/vp-dhankar-parliament-north-star-8424016/"><strong>Indian Express</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: Recently ‘North Star’ has been in news from the political context</p>
<p><strong>What is North Star?</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Polaris, also known as the North Star or the Pole Star,</strong> is a very bright star (around 2500 times more luminous than our sun) placed less than 1° away from the north celestial pole.</p>
<ul>
<li>Its position and brightness have made humans use it for navigation since late antiquity. It is a part of the constellation <strong>Ursa Minor and is around 323 light-years away from Earth.</strong></li>
<li>Since Polaris lies nearly in a direct line with the Earth’s rotational axis “above” the North Pole, it stands <strong>almost motionless in the night sky,</strong> with all the stars of the northern sky appearing to rotate around it. <strong>This makes it an excellent fixed point from which to draw measurements for celestial navigation</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Does the Northern Star “change”?</strong></p>
<p>The northern celestial pole changes over time. “If you picture a line connecting Earth’s North and South Poles as the axis around which Earth rotates, <strong>that axis is slowly moving in its own circle”.</strong> Over a period of around 26,000 years, <strong>the Earth’s axis completes one full rotation</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>By the end of the 21st century, <strong>the celestial pole will move away from Polaris – humans will need to identify a new ‘North Star’</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Meaning of <strong>“</strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/parliament-and-state-legislatures/"><strong>parliament</strong></a> <strong>is the North Star of democracy”:</strong> It is the <strong>institution that guides democratic functioning, that dictates the direction a democracy takes</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since it represents the ‘<strong>will of the people’</strong>, many political thinkers have always felt that as an institution, the parliament is the most fundamental in a democracy.</li>
<li>For CJI Chandrachud, North Star is the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/indian-constitution/basic-structure-doctrine/">basic structure doctrine .</a></li>

<ul>
<li>The RBI has a <strong>Central Repository of Information on Large Credits (CRILC) database</strong> system where the banks report their <strong>exposure of ₹5 crores and above</strong> which is used for monitoring purposes.</li>
<li><strong>The banking sector remains resilient and stable</strong>: Various parameters relating to capital adequacy, asset quality, liquidity, provision coverage and profitability are healthy.</li>
<li>Banks are also in compliance with the <strong>Large Exposure Framework (LEF) guidelines</strong> issued by the RBI</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are the Large Exposure Framework (LEF) guidelines?</strong></p>
<p>LEF are guidelines aimed to <strong>monitor and limit losses of a bank</strong> from a client or corporation. It is based on the 2014 Basel guidelines.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>An exception to LEF</strong>: Banks need not report exposure if the loans are taken from RBI, is guaranteed by the Government of India or have Intra-day interbank exposures or deposits are maintained by NABARD (due to shortfall in target for <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/08/07/priority-sector-lending-psl/">Priority sector Lending</a>)</li>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: Researchers are using <strong>muons</strong> to study the fortress wall of Xi’an, an ancient city in China. <strong>Muons have revealed small density anomalies, which may pose safety risks</strong>, within the wall.</p>
<ul>
<li>Researchers deployed a technique called <strong>muon tomography or muography, which uses muons to generate three-dimensional images of such large structures.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/04/14/insights-into-editorial-muon-g-2-landmark-study-challenges-rulebook-of-particle-physics/"><strong>muons</strong></a><strong>?</strong></p>

They are created when the particles in Earth’s atmosphere <strong>collide with cosmic rays</strong> — clusters of high-energy particles that move through space at just below the speed of light. According to <strong>Scientific American magazine, “about 10,000 muons reach every square meter of the Earth’s surface a minute”.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is muon tomography or muography?</strong></p>
<p>Muography is conceptually similar to <strong>X-ray but capable of scanning much larger and wider structures,</strong> owing to the <strong>penetration power of muons</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Applications of Muography:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Muons and archaeology:</strong> In 2017, modern archaeologists repeated the experiment with more sophisticated and <strong>advanced muon detectors and stumbled upon a major finding.</strong></li>
<li><strong>CORMIS</strong> (<strong>Cosmic Ray Muon Imaging System</strong>), to examine the wall of Xi’an city</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> To <strong>support and expand its green industry</strong>, the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/10/28/the-european-union/">European Union</a> revealed the “<strong>Green Deal Industrial Plan” that aims to cut red tape and provide massive subsidies.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the ‘Green Deal Industrial Plan’?</strong></p>
<p>The proposal involves <strong>building a simpler regulatory framework, providing faster access to funds, enhancing skills, and improving the EU’s trade network.</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simpler regulatory framework</strong>: The plan seeks to formulate a “<a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/04/08/what-is-net-zero-and-what-are-indias-objections/"><strong>Net-Zero</strong></a> <strong>Industry Act</strong>”, which will not only simplify rules but also speed up the issuance of permits for green projects, such as renewable energy generation arrays, <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2017/08/08/insights-mindmaps-bio-energy-carbon-capture-sequestration-beccs-antibiotics-poultry-farms/">carbon capture</a>, and <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/05/centre-clears-%E2%82%B919744-crore-green-hydrogen-mission/">renewable hydrogen</a> production facilities.<ul>
<li>It also includes a “<strong>Critical Raw Materials Act</strong>”, which will provide access to materials like <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/12/13/rare-earth-elements/">rare earth</a> that are crucial for developing <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/04/going-green-on-budget-2023s-and-indias-net-zero-commitment/">net-zero</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Providing faster access to funds:</strong> According to the proposal, state aid rules will be loosened in order to help the EU’s 27 governments with investing in clean energy projects.<ul>
<li>There is also a provision for setting up a “<strong>European Sovereignty Fund</strong>” in the future to “give a structural answer to the investment needs”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Enhancing skills:</strong> The plan aims to establish <strong>“Net-Zero Industry Academies”</strong> that will provide up-skilling and re-skilling programmes in strategic industries.</li>
<li><strong>Improving the trade network</strong>: The plan underlines the importance of <strong>open trade and seeks to further “develop the EU’s network of Free Trade Agreements and other forms of cooperation with partners to support the green transition.”</strong></li>
