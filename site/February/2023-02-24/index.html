<p><strong>Context:</strong> Maharashtra political controversy cases that are currently pending before the SC will have wide consequences as they raise certain fundamental issues about the working of India’s “<a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/01/20/anti-defection-law-3/">anti-defection law</a>”.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Last year, the ruling <strong>MVA</strong> coalition lost power after an internal splintering of the Shiv Sena party.</li>
<li>A faction then joined hands with the BJP to form the new ruling coalition and the disputes between the various parties have been continuing since then.</li>

<p><strong>The working of the</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/06/17/10th-schedule-of-the-constitution-5/">10th Schedule</a><strong>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Innumerable instances of governments being “toppled” mid-term.</li>
<li><strong>Power-politics and intra-party dissent.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mass resignations</strong> (instead of defections) to force a fresh election.</li>
<li>Partisan actions by <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/03/12/insights-into-editorial-the-office-of-the-governor/">State Governors</a> with respect to swearing-in ceremonies and the timing of floor tests.</li>
<li>Partisan actions by <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/11/26/speaker-of-the-lok-sabha-2/">Speakers</a> – refusing to decide disqualification petitions/acting in undue haste.</li>
<li>In effect, the <strong>10th Schedule has been reduced to a nullity</strong>, governments that do not have clear majorities are vulnerable.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The challenging task before the court:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Has to adjudicate the actions of a number of constitutional functionaries</strong>: Governors, Speakers, legislative party leaders, and elected representatives.</li>
<li>It does not have the liberty of presuming dishonesty.</li>
<li>It must maintain an <strong>institutional arm’s-length</strong> from the political actors and adjudicate according to legalities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SC’s judgments on defection:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In the <strong>Kihoto Hollohan case (1992),</strong> the SC upheld the sweeping discretion available to the Speaker in deciding cases of disqualification of MLAs.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Nabam Rebia judgment (2016),</strong> the SC held that the Speaker cannot decide on a disqualification petition while a notice under Article 179(c) for the Speaker’s removal is pending.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Keisham Meghachandra case (2020)</strong>,</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The politicians are cunning enough to find loopholes in the 10th Schedule as well as the SC judgments. Therefore, the SC should not leave any stone unturned this time.</p>

<p><strong>The role of individual MPs (Members of Parliament) has diminished over the years and as a result, healthy constructive debates on policy issues are not usually witnessed.

<p><strong>Context</strong>: The government of India is drawing up a data ecosystem (through NDAP) thus enabling policy-makers and researchers to exploit the potential of public data</p>
<p><strong>About</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/01/29/with-data-being-the-new-oil-national-data-and-analytics-platform-will-work-to-democratize-access-to-publicly-available-government-data-elucidate/">National Data &amp; Analytics Platform (NDAP</a>) <strong>(NDAP):</strong></p>
<p>The National Data &amp; Analytics Platform (NDAP) was <strong>launched in 2022 by NITI Aayog</strong> in collaboration with different ministries and state governments in India.</p>
<ul>
<li>NDAP aims to <strong>democratize access to public government data</strong> by making it accessible, interoperable, interactive, and available on a user-friendly platform for various stakeholders such as policymakers, civil servants, university students and researchers, journalists, innovators, and civil society groups.</li>
<li>It has been part of the <strong>State Support Mission of NITI Aayog</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/NDAP.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/NDAP.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Current Issues:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of uniformity in data format and no interoperability:</strong> The need to bring NDAP arose because public <strong>data in India was difficult to use</strong>, and users couldn’t compare <strong>data from different departments</strong> or data gathered over time due to <strong>differences in format and quality</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Implications of rising digital Technologies</strong>: The rise of data and digital technologies is rapidly transforming economies and societies, with enormous implications for governments’ daily operations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How NDAP solves these issues?</strong></p>
<p>NDAP solves these issues by providing a <strong>user-friendly platform</strong> that presents <strong>standardized datasets from central and state government entities</strong> and provides tools for <strong>analytics and visualization.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>For example,</strong> A state-level <strong>civil servant building new primary health centres</strong> can easily find and integrate three public datasets:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Health department’s Management Information System (MIS):</strong> List of communities with existing PHCs</li>
<li><strong>Economic Census from the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI):</strong> To get a list of communities with private health facilities</li>
<li><strong>The Population Census from the Registrar General of India (RGI):</strong> To prioritize villages based on size</li>
</ul>
<p>With NDAP, the decision-maker can <strong>access the data from all three sources seamlessly</strong> linked into a single dataset, saving time and effort. NDAP can leverage data to strengthen good governance by making it easier to access and analyze public data. </p>
<p><strong>Significance of NDAP</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enables linking and use of several types of data</strong> at once.</li>
<li><strong>The standardized dataset</strong> enables merging and cross-sectoral analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Simplifies the data</strong> for it to be used by the government, academia, journalism, civil society, and the private sector</li>
<li><strong>Customizes data</strong> as per the need: Users can create flexible tables and visualizations</li>
<li><strong>Quality benchmark datasets</strong>: Data shown has to meet NDAP’s in-house 5-star rating framework.</li>
<li><strong>Enables data-driven governance</strong> and programme outcomes for the common public </li>

NDAP has now been included in the curriculum of <strong>officer trainees at the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration,</strong> Mussoorie. It will enable incoming government officers to develop a <strong>data-driven decision-making mindset</strong> from their first field job. Overall, NDAP has the potential to be an open data platform that can play a vital role in facilitating data-driven governance in India.</p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-3"><strong>GS Paper 3</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Science and Technology</strong></p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> India’s R&amp;D expenditure-GDP ratio of 0.7% is very low when compared to major economies and is much below the world average of 1.8%.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/India__spend.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/India__spend.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Main reasons behind India’s low R&amp;D expenditure-GDP ratio:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Low investment by the corporate sector:</strong> While the corporate sector accounts for about 2/3rd of gross domestic expenditure on R&amp;D (GERD) in leading economies, <strong>its share in India is just 37%.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Low investment by MNCs: For example,</strong> US-based MNCs spent $9.5 billion (₹649.7 billion) on R&amp;D in India in 2018, which increased to $9.8 billion (₹690.2 billion) in the following year.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Issues with the current system:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The National Science and Technology Management Information System (<strong>NSTMIS</strong>) of the DST is the agency that compiles GERD statistics in India.</li>
<li>The NSTMIS relies on the <strong>Department of Scientific and Industrial Research</strong> (DSIR) list of recognised R&amp;D units and the database of the Centre For Monitoring Indian Economy Pvt. Ltd. for this purpose.</li>
<li>It is easier to gather information on R&amp;D from the government sector, the higher education sector and public sector enterprises, <strong>but not for the</strong> <strong>private corporate sector</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key factors making the official R&amp;D estimates grossly inadequate:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The DSIR list may not have many of the actual R&amp;D performers since they may not be inclined to register themselves for two reasons:</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>○             They consider government incentives are not attractive enough</strong></p>
<p><strong>○             Some firms are sensitive about sharing critical information</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Some R&amp;D firms in services such as software find it difficult <strong>to meet the requirement of having separate infrastructure</strong> for R&amp;D to distinguish it from their usual business.</li>
<li>Some of the leading Indian enterprises in new technology areas and foreign R&amp;D centres are not covered.<ul>
<li><strong>For example, SigTuple Technologies</strong>, which is a leading start-up in India focusing on AI-based HealthTech, is unlisted in both databases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead for transforming India’s R&amp;D statistics</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>T<strong>he NSTMIS should use the patents granted data</strong>, in addition to its current method to identify R&amp;D-performing enterprises.</li>
<li>Annual R&amp;D estimates can be prepared from <strong>mandatory disclosures</strong> that the enterprises are required to make to the <strong>Ministry of Corporate Affairs.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Technologies</strong> can be used like in the case of revamped IT return forms where various sections are interlinked.</li>
<li><strong>Proper disclosure</strong> of information to regulatory agencies.</li>

<p><strong>GS Paper  3</strong></p>
<p><strong>Syllabus</strong><strong>: Science and Technology: Biotechnology</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/hiv-cure-8462781/">Indian Express</a><strong>,</strong> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00479-2#:~:text=A%2053%2Dyear%2Dold%20man,stem%20cells%20from%20a%20donor.">Nature</a></p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: The man referred to as the <strong>“Dusseldorf patient</strong>” became the third person to have been “<a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/02/25/insights-into-editorial-a-miracle-cure-for-hiv/">cured of HIV”</a> after a <strong>bone marrow transplant carrying a specific HIV-resistant – CCR5 delta 32 genetic mutation.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is CCR5 mutation and how does it fight off HIV?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>HIV mainly <strong>targets and damages CD4 immune cells</strong> in the body, reducing the body’s ability to defend against infections. The virus enters the <strong>CD4 cells through CCR5 receptors</strong> on their surface, but the <strong>CCR5-delta 32 mutation prevents the formation of these receptors,</strong> making it impossible for HIV to enter the cells. (Refer to the infographic given below)</li>
<li>Only <strong>1% of people worldwide have two copies of the CCR5-delta 32 mutation</strong>, while 20% of people have <strong>one copy of the mutation</strong>, which is more common in those of European ancestry. People with the mutation are highly resistant to HIV infection.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/HIV.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/HIV.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Current treatments for HIV:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There are <strong>no cures for the infection</strong> at present, but the disease can be <strong>managed using antiretroviral</strong> <strong>therapy</strong>.</li>
<li>These medicines <strong>suppress the replication of the virus within the body</strong>, allowing the number of <strong>CD4 immune cells to bounce back</strong>.</li>
<li>If left untreated, <strong>the virus destroys a person’s immune system and they are said to be in the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome stage (AIDS)</strong> where they get several opportunistic infections that may result in death.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Earlier works on the CCR5 gene:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A Chinese scientist edited the genomes of twins to remove this CCR5 gene in <strong>an attempt to make them immune to HIV. Their father was living with HIV.</strong></li>
<li>He faced immediate backlash from the scientific community and legal action. This is because guidelines for <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/science-technology/biotechnology/gene-editing/#:~:text=Gene%20Editing%20is%20a%20type,insertions%20to%20site%20specific%20locations.">genetic editing</a> <strong>prohibit germ-line editing</strong> – <strong>editing a genome that can be passed from one generation to the other</strong> – as the editing techniques are not very precise and the long-term consequences of such editing are unknown.</li>

<p><strong>Example 1:  Mud Brick Home</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jegatheesan A, a civil engineer from Tamil Nadu</strong>, India, built a mud brick home called <strong>‘Thaimann Veedu’</strong> which means mother earth in Tamil, to preserve traditional mud houses and showcase their strength as a building material.</p>
<ul>
<li>He used <strong>recycled materials such as wood and metals</strong> for the construction of his sustainable home.</li>
<li>The house is designed to <strong>keep it cooler in summer and warmer in winter</strong>, with breathable walls that <strong>minimize the usage of ACs</strong> or fans.</li>
<li>The house also has a <strong>20,000-litre rainwater harvesting tank</strong>, a terrace garden, and an oxide floor.</li>
<li><strong>Maximum use of Natural light</strong>, hence reducing the cost of electricity bills to as low as Rs 20 or Rs 30 every two months.</li>
<li>The 1,000 sqft two-storied house is made <strong>without cutting even a single tree</strong>, and all the window frames, doors, etc are made from <strong>reused wood.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example 2: Packaging</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Global beverage brand Pernod Ricard</strong> in India announced in May 2022, the removal of <strong>permanent mono-cartons</strong> from their packaging.</p>
<ul>
<li>They have launched an <strong>environment-first campaign #OneForOurPlanet</strong> that is inspiring consumers to make eco-conscious purchase decisions about <strong>Biodegradable packaging or no packaging</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Usage: Both examples can be used for sustainable living and recycling.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Chief Justice of India (CJI) announced that the SC will adopt a “neutral citation system” for its judgments.</p>
<p><strong>What is a “citation”?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A case citation is essentially <strong>an identification tag</strong> for a judgment and it would contain a reference number, the year of the judgment, the name of the court, etc.</li>
<li><strong>For example,</strong> for the landmark Kesavananda Bharati case, the citation is AIR 1973 SC 1461.</li>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is deliberating on allowing permanent capital vehicles (PCVs), evergreen or perpetual funds.</p>
<p><strong>What are Perpetual Funds?</strong></p>
<p>Unlike traditional funds which have a finite tenure, perpetual funds don’t have a maturity date. These funds are <strong>aimed at long-term investors</strong> such as pension funds and insurance firms which <strong>do not want the return of capital</strong> but regular income.</p>
<ul>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The National Stock Exchange of India has received final approval from SEBI to launch a <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/03/16/social-stock-exchange/">Social Stock Exchange (SSE)</a> as a separate segment of the NSE.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aim</strong>: To provide new avenues for social enterprises to finance social initiatives, provide them visibility, and bring in increased transparency in fund mobilisation and utilisation.</li>
<li><strong>Eligibility</strong>: Any social enterprise, Non-Profit Organization (NPOs), or For-Profit Social Enterprise (FPE) that <strong>establishes its primacy of social intent</strong> can get registered/listed on the SSE segment.</li>
<li><strong>Function:</strong><ul>
<li>The SSE will allow social enterprises to raise <strong>capital as equity, debt, or as units like a mutual fund</strong>.</li>
<li>The minimum <strong>issue size is set at INR 1 crore</strong>, and the <strong>minimum application size</strong> for subscription is <strong>INR 2 lakhs for Zero Coupon Zero Principal (ZCZP</strong>) issuance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is ZCZP?</strong></p>
<p>These are financial instruments that <strong>any non-profit organisation</strong> can use to raise funds. The borrowing entity <strong>does not have to pay interest</strong>—therefore zero coupon—and it <strong>does not have to pay the principal</strong> (zero principal) either.</p>
<p><strong>BSE</strong> had already got approval for the SSE as a separate segment (in 2022)</p>
<p>The idea of SSE was <strong>first floated by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman</strong> in her 2019-20 Budget speech.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> According to a new study- <strong>blue food</strong>, sourced <strong>from aquatic environments</strong>, can reduce nutritional deficiencies, and contribute to employment, and export revenue in India.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of Blue Food:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce dietary environmental footprints: Compared to terrestrial meat, <strong>blue foods generate lower emissions</strong>.</li>
<li>Contribute to the <strong>health, nutrition, well-being, and livelihoods of rural communities</strong>.</li>
<li>India can use aquatic foods to <strong>address B12 and omega-3 deficiencies</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is B12?</strong></p>
<p>Vitamin B₁₂, also known as cobalamin, is a water-soluble vitamin involved in metabolism. It is one of eight B vitamins. It is required for DNA synthesis and in both fatty acid and amino acid metabolism. <strong>Vitamin B12</strong> deficiency may lead to a reduction in healthy red blood cells (anaemia)</p>
<p><strong>What is Omega-3?</strong></p>
<p>Omega-3 fatty acids are <strong>“healthy fats</strong>” that support heart health (help prevent heart disease and stroke). One key benefit is helping to lower your triglycerides. A deficiency of essential fatty acids—either omega-3s or omega-6s—can cause <strong>rough, scaly skin and dermatitis</strong>.</p>
