<p><strong>Direction: This article is in continuation of</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/07/why-turkey-is-prone-to-devastating-earthquakes/"><strong>yesterday’s article on the same issue</strong></a><strong>. Here we will be covering other issues related to Earthquake</strong></p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: South-eastern Turkey, near the Syrian border, was struck by a powerful Earthquake of <strong>7.8</strong> on the Richter Scale.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/turkey_earth.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/turkey_earth.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Why have the buildings collapsed in the “pancake mode” (like a pack of cards)?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shallow Earthquake</strong>: The centre of the quake was just <strong>11 miles ( around 18 Km) beneath</strong> the Earth’s surface, making it one of the most damaging earthquakes.<ul>
<li><strong>Shallower earthquakes</strong> can be more destructive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Non-enforcement of safe building construction and non-adherence to seismic building codes:</strong> Many of the buildings are already built, <strong>and seismic retrofitting</strong> may be expensive or not considered a priority compared to other socio-economic challenges of Turkey and Syria</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How do Satellites help in Rescue and Recovery efforts during an</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/world-geography/physical-geography-of-the-world/geomorphology/internal-forces-their-impact/earthquakes/"><strong>Earthquake</strong></a><strong>?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Satellite imaging enables humanitarian aid</strong> to better deliver water and food by mapping the condition of roads, bridges, and buildings, and – most crucially – identifying populations trying to escape potential aftershocks.</li>
<li><strong>Radar satellites</strong> will complement the imaging information, as they also operate at night and through clouds, image landslides and even very small changes in altitude.</li>
<li><strong>Generating Maps:</strong> Images are transformed into impact or change maps for rescue workers, flood alert maps for the public, and mapping of burnt or flooded areas with damage estimates for decision-makers.</li>
<li><strong>Reconstruction after disasters:</strong> Satellite technologies help residents benefit from earthquake-resistant construction, the creation of safe gathering places or relocating living areas to safe locations.<ul>
<li>“R<strong>econstruction observatories</strong>“, have been carried out after major disasters (e.g. Haiti in 2021 and in Beirut after the 2019 port explosion) to monitor reconstruction planning</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>India’s Proactiveness in Disaster Relief:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Turkey (2023): India is sending an Army medical team, National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF)</strong> personnel, and medical supplies</li>
<li><strong>Nepal (2015):</strong> The NDRF deployed 16 of its <strong>urban search and rescue (USAR) teams</strong>, which comprised more than 700 rescuers in the country</li>
<li><strong>Japan (2011):</strong>In the aftermath of the 2011 Tsunami, India also sent 46 members of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) to search and rescue in the town of Onagawa. It was their <strong>first overseas</strong> operation</li>
<li><strong>Sri Lanka (2004, Operation Rainbow):</strong> Despite being the victim of the 2004 Tsunami itself, India sent its forces to carry out rescue operations, called “<strong>Operation Rainbow</strong>”, in Sri Lanka hours after the Tsunami struck the country.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>“<strong><em>It is not the disaster, but the lack of preparedness for the disaster that kills</em></strong>”. Thus, disaster preparedness is one of the most vital components of disaster management.</p>
<p><strong>Related news:</strong></p>
<p>Turkey invoked the <strong>International Charter on “Space and Major Disasters</strong>”, just after the Earthquake.</p>
<p><strong>About the International Charter on “Space and Major Disasters</strong>”:</p>
<p>The charter was created by the National Space Research Centre and the European Space Agency in 1999, (now has 17-member space agencies). It aims to provide <strong>free satellite imagery as quickly as possible</strong> over the disaster area.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> For the third time in a month the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) failed to elect its mayor after AAP and BJP councillors again engaged in a row over the election process.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This MCD conflict is <strong>an extension of the years-long tussle</strong> between the two parties over the administration of the national capital.</li>
<li>Given the complex governance system in place in Delhi, the state and the central governments ought to cooperate, but this goal has proven challenging in the era of <strong>intense political competition.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What’s the ongoing issue in the MCD?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Presiding Officer (a BJP councillor) for the mayoral election said that <strong>aldermen</strong> (nominated members) are allowed to vote in the House and elect the Mayor, Deputy Mayor, and members of the Standing Committee.</li>
<li>However, the AAP had expressed apprehension, as they claim that aldermen do not have voting rights under <strong>the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957.</strong></li>
<li>In the absence of a mayor, <strong>major decisions related to policy matters, development works and projects</strong> that require big financial investment are</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Case of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC):</strong> An astonishing 22 of 28 municipal corporations in Maharashtra (including the country’s richest civic body – BMC) have seen their terms expire with fresh polls nowhere in sight.</p>
<p><strong>Examining</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/issues-related-to-urban-development/urban-local-government/measures-to-strengthen-urban-local-bodies-in-india/"><strong>urban local governance</strong></a> <strong>in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Constitution (</strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/functions-and-responsibilities-of-the-union-and-the-states-issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure-devolution-of-powers-and-finances-up-to-local-levels-and-challenges-therein/devolution-of-powers-and-finances-up-to-local-levels-and-challenges-therein/74th-amendment-act-municipalities/#:~:text=Composition%3A,territorial%20constituencies%20known%20was%20wards"><strong>74th Amendment</strong></a><strong>) Act, 1992</strong> has introduced (Part IX A Article 243 P to ZG] and Schedule XII) in the Constitution, which provides for the establishment of <strong>urban local bodies</strong> (ULBs) as institutions of <strong>local self-government</strong>.</li>
<li>It has empowered state governments <strong>to devolve the responsibility of 18 functions</strong> including urban planning, regulation of land use, water supply, etc., and <strong>made periodic elections compulsory for them.</strong></li>
<li>Urban governance is part of the <strong>state list</strong> under the Constitution. Thus, the <strong>administrative framework and regulation of ULBs vary across states.</strong></li>
<li>Experts have highlighted that ULBs across India face <strong>similar challenges. For instance,</strong> lacking autonomy, city-level functions are managed by parastatals, devolution of powers is incomplete (lacks taxation powers – stressed municipal finances), irregular elections, etc.</li>
<li>These challenges have led to <strong>poor service delivery</strong>, severely curtailing urban governance at a time when <strong>675 million Indians are slated to live in urban centres by 2035.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/factodi.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/factodi.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/issues-related-to-urban-development/urban-local-government/measures-to-strengthen-urban-local-bodies-in-india/"><strong>Key suggestions</strong></a> <strong>to improve urban local governance in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Constitutional amendments</strong> (for making devolution of powers mandatory and setting the accountability of state governments – ULBs) to achieve objectives of <strong>urban decentralisation</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Supporting reform-linked investments</strong> (on asset creation as well as management) is needed for different states based on the level of urbanisation.</li>
<li>Inter-government transfers should have <strong>in-built incentives to improve performance.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Integrate various urban development</strong> programs (including capacity building) at local, state and national levels to develop <strong>sustainable city</strong> or metropolitan regions.</li>
<li>Strengthen urban institutions and <strong>clarify the roles of different organisations</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>The second generation of urban reforms</strong> should further focus on regulation, innovative financing and PPP, and climate change initiatives.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> In order to establish smarter cities, empowered instead of stalled local bodies are needed. Therefore, Mumbai needs municipal elections, while Delhi needs a mayor.</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: More than 2,000 people have been arrested in a statewide crackdown on child marriages that have taken place in the <strong>state of Assam</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Data on</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/issues-related-to-children/child-marriage/"><strong>child Marriage</strong></a><strong>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>UN estimates suggest <strong>that 1.5</strong> <strong>million girls get married before they turn 18 in India.</strong></li>
<li>According to the 2011 census, <strong>44 per cent of women in Assam were married before the age of 18.</strong> The figures for Rajasthan, Bihar, and Madhya Pradesh were <strong>47 per cent, 46 per cent, and 43 per cent, respectively.</strong></li>

<p><strong>Historical Perspective on Child Marriage:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ancient India</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Manusmritis:</strong> It says that if the father <strong>fails to marry off his daughter within three years of her attaining puberty, she can find a spouse on her own.</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Medhatithi</strong>, one of the oldest and earliest <strong>commentators on the Manusmriti, eight years is the right age for a girl to be given in marriage</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <strong>Rig Veda mentions garbhadhan</strong>– attaining the wealth of the womb. It is the first of the <strong>16 samskaras a Hindu is expected to perform</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>The Greek traveller Megasthenes (350-290 BC)</strong> has written that he was told that the women of the <strong>Pandian kingdom in South India bear children at six years of age</strong>. About seven centuries later, the Persian polymath, <strong>Al Biruni, wrote that child marriages were rampant in India</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Modern India:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>The colonial state:</strong> The <strong>Age of Consent Acts of 1861 and 1891</strong> brought in reform in conjugal rights. The 1861 Act laid down 10 years as the minimum age for sexual intercourse. The Hindu intelligentsia opposed raising this age to 12 on the grounds that it violated norms related to garbhadhan.</li>
<li><strong>Rukmabai case gave new impetus to the campaign of social reformers like M G Ranade and Behramji Merwanji Malabari.</strong> Rukmabai had refused to solemnize her marriage, which had taken place when she was 11.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Post-Independence:</strong><ul>
<li>At the time of India’s independence, the <strong>minimum marriageable age stood at 15 years for females and 18 years for men.</strong></li>
<li>In 1978, the government increased <strong>it to 18 for girls and 21 for men.</strong></li>
<li>Years later, in <strong>2008</strong>, the Law Commission came out with a report which stated that the minimum marriageable age for <strong>both men and women should be 18 years of age, as both are considered eligible to vote as citizens at the time.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Laws present to prevent Child Marriage:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/11/08/the-protection-of-children-from-sexual-offences-pocso-act/"><strong>POCSO</strong></a> <strong>Act, of 2012</strong> criminalizes <strong>sex between a minor and an adult.</strong> The law does not recognize a minor’s consent as valid. Sexual assault under POCSO is a non-bailable, cognizable offence.<ul>
<li>Section 19 of, the POCSO Act imposes a “<strong>mandatory reporting obligation</strong>” which requires every person who suspects or has knowledge of a <strong>sexual offence being committed against a child must report it to the police or the Special Juvenile Police Unit.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act 2006</strong>, says that <strong>child marriages are illegal but not void.</strong> Instead, <strong>they are voidable at the option of the minor party</strong>, in the scenario that the minor petitions the court to declare the marriage void. The Act stipulates 18 years as the minimum marriageable age for women, while for men it is 21 years.<ul>
<li>The punishment also extends to anyone who <strong>performs, conducts, directs, or abets any child marriage</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Central government’s stand:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In 2021, the Central government sought to <strong>introduce the</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/05/17/sansad-tv-bills-an-insight-prohibition-of-child-marriage-amendment-bill-2021/#:~:text=The%20Prohibition%20of%20Child%20Marriage%20(Amendment)%20Bill%2C%202021%20seeks,Sports%20on%20December%2021%2C%202021."><strong>Prevention of Child Marriage (Amendment) Bill 2021</strong></a><strong>,</strong> to raise the manageable age for women across all religions, from 18 to 21 years. However, the Parliament panel examining this is yet to submit its report.</li>
<li>The establishment of the <strong>Jaya Jaitly Committee in June 2020,</strong> by the Ministry of Women &amp; Child Development, submitted a report stating that the marriageable <strong>age for women should be increased from 18 to 21 years of age, in light of factors like reproductive health, education, etc.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Modern</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/08/09/un-slams-child-marriages/"><strong>international laws and conventions</strong></a> <strong>on Child Marriage:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The UN Convention on Consent to Marriage,</li>
<li>Minimum Age for Marriage and Registration of Marriages (1962),</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> According to the Ministry of Social Justice &amp; Empowerment, the existing income limit for determining the non-creamy layer among OBC “<strong>is considered sufficient</strong>” and there is no proposal to revise the said income limit.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Currently, an annual income of both parents of <strong>₹8 lakh or more excludes</strong> OBCs from availing reservation, putting them in the creamy layer category, <strong>leaving benefits only for those earning less than that.</strong></li>
<li>Several Backward Class associations and the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2018/08/09/insights-mindmaps-national-commission-for-backward-classes-ncbc/">NCBC</a> have consistently <strong>demanded/recommended</strong> that the income limit should be raised to at least <strong>₹10 lakh</strong>, so that more can avail of the quota system benefits.</li>
<li>Ever since the OBC quota was introduced, <strong>the Union government has asked the NCBC</strong> to evaluate the need to raise this income limit based on current circumstances.</li>
<li><strong>The first time the limit was revised in 2004 (</strong>raised to ₹2.5 lakh in 2004, ₹4.5 lakh in 2008, ₹6 lakh in 2013, and ₹8 lakh in 2017<strong>)</strong>, following which the NCBC would be entrusted to do the same every three years.</li>
<li>An internal government task force (headed by B.P. Sharma – former DoPT Secy) had also concluded in its 2019 report that the income limit for determining the creamy layer among OBCs should be <strong>raised to ₹12 lakh.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/12/09/creamy-layer-principle-in-sc-st-quota-for-promotion/"><strong>The Creamy Layer</strong></a><strong>:</strong> It is a concept that <strong>sets a threshold</strong> within which OBC reservation benefits are applicable.</p>
<p><strong>Genesis of the concept:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The 2nd Backward Classes Commission/</strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/10/14/editorial-analysis-the-democratization-of-india-the-mandal-way/"><strong>Mandal Commission report</strong></a><strong>:</strong> The government provided <strong>27% reservation</strong> in central government jobs for OBCs in 1990. This was <strong>challenged</strong> in the SC by several writ petitions.</li>
<li><strong>Indira Sawhney Case (1992):</strong> A nine-judge bench of the SC had upheld reservations for OBCs, but ruled that the <strong>creamy layer</strong> (to be decided by the central government) among the backward class of citizens <strong>must be excluded.</strong></li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Supreme Court has dismissed a plea by the <strong>Uttar Pradesh government</strong> to not bind the <strong>governor with a three months deadline</strong> to decide on remission pleas of convicts serving a life term</p>
<ul>
<li>Previously, SC had directed the state government to decide on <strong>2,248 cases of remission</strong> within three months.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SC observation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Even a constitutional authority</strong> cannot say that she or he is above the law</li>
<li><strong>The law obligates each and every authority equally</strong>, and the Constitution ascertains there is no vacuum even at the level of constitutional functionaries.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Remission:</strong></p>
<p>Remission is <strong>releasing a convicted prisoner before the expiry of their sentence</strong>. The concept of remission was introduced through the Prisons Act, 1894.</p>
<p><strong>Constitutional</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Article 72</strong>: The President of India has the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites or remissions of punishment.</li>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> The US shot down a Chinese ‘spy’ balloon, days after the surveillance device was first spotted over American airspace.</p>
<p><strong>What are spy balloons?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Spy balloons are <strong>high-altitude surveillance tools</strong> that usually operate at 80,000-120,000 feet – well above the cruising altitude of commercial aircraft – <strong>to gather intelligence and carry out other military missions.</strong></li>
<li>During the cold war, the U.S. military used high-altitude <strong>balloons (Project Genetrix, Project Mogul) to spy on the Soviet Union.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Economically viable</strong> unlike satellites</li>
<li>Due to their proximity to Earth’s surface, they can take <strong>high-resolution images of the target</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Disadvantage</strong>: Not directly steered, but roughly guided.</li>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: Google has finally decided to start public testing for a new <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Artificial-Intelligence.pdf"><strong>AI</strong></a> <strong>chatbot of its own called Bard</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>What is Bard:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bard is based on <strong>Language Model for Dialogue Application or LaMDA and Google’s own conversational AI chatbot</strong>. It is termed an “<strong>experimental conversational AI service</strong>.”</li>
<li>The model is currently a <strong>“lightweight” version of LaMDA,</strong> and the one being “<strong>requires significantly less computing power, enabling us to scale to more users, allowing for more feedback</strong>.”</li>
<li><strong>ChatGPT is powered by Microsoft’s Azure Cloud services</strong>.</li>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/jupiter-beats-saturn-to-become-the-planet-with-most-moons-92/article66470703.ece"><strong>The Hindu</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: Astronomers have discovered <strong>12 new moons around Jupiter, putting the total count at a record-breaking 92.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Jupiter and Saturn are loaded with small moons<strong>, believed to be fragments of once bigger moons that collided with one another or with comets or asteroids</strong>. The same goes for Uranus and Neptune, but <strong>they’re so distant that it makes moon-spotting even harder.</strong></li>
<li>Uranus has 27 confirmed moons, Neptune 14, Mars two, and Earth one. Venus and Mercury come up empty.</li>
<li>Jupiter’s <strong>newly discovered moons have yet to be named.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/israeli-scientists-develop-sniffing-robot-with-locust-antennae/article66477154.ece"><strong>The Hindu</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: A new <strong>sniffing robot equipped with a biological sensor</strong> that uses the <strong>antennae of locusts</strong> could help advance disease diagnosis and improve security checks.</p>
<p>Locusts have an <strong>acute sense of smell</strong>, which the researchers have managed to <strong>harness into their bio-hybrid robot</strong>, making it far more <strong>sensitive than existing electronic sniffers</strong>.</p>
<p>On the <strong>four-wheeled robot</strong>, the researchers placed the insect’s antenna between two electrodes that send electrical signals as a response to a nearby odour. <strong>Each scent has a unique signature which, with machine learning, the robot’s electronic system can identify.</strong></p>
<p><strong>About Bio-Hybrid Robots:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bio-hybrid robots refer to <strong>robots that integrate biological components with artificial components, such as electronics and mechanics</strong>.</li>
<li>These robots may use <strong>biological materials such as cells, tissues, or muscles as actuators, sensors, or energy sources.</strong></li>
<li>The use of biological components can provide advantages such as greater <strong>dexterity, adaptability, and energy efficiency compared to traditional robotic systems</strong>.</li>
