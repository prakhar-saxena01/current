<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Structure, Organization, and Functioning of the Executive and the Judiciary</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/on-sealed-cover-jurisprudence/article66529943.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a> </p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The CJI refused the ‘suggestions’ of the government in a sealed cover on the formation of a proposed committee to enquire into the Hindenburg report on the Adani Group.</p>
<p><strong>What is sealed cover jurisprudence?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is a practice (origins can be traced to service or administrative cases) used by the <strong>SC and sometimes lower courts</strong>, of asking/accept information from government agencies in sealed envelopes <strong>that can only be accessed by judges.</strong></li>
<li>While <strong>a specific law does not define</strong> the doctrine of sealed cover, the SC derives its power to use it from the SC Rules 2013 and the Indian Evidence Act 1872.</li>
<li>R<strong>ecent times have seen the government produce myriad documents</strong> (such as the Rafale jets’ purchase deal, and the Ayodhya title dispute) as sealed covers, resulting in the doctrine rising to the status of ‘due procedure’.</li>
</ul>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Way ahead (The SC’s rulings):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The government should claim a <strong>‘specific privilege’</strong> and <strong>explain the “extenuating circumstances”</strong> to keep documents secret from the other party.</li>
<li><strong>The burden would lie on the government</strong> to prove that sharing copies of the records would prove detrimental to national security and public order.</li>
<li>The sealed covers could be used <strong>only in a “small exception” of cases.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ethical Issues concerned:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The use of Sealed Covers</strong> raises ethical concerns <strong>about transparency and fairness</strong> in judicial proceedings.</li>
<li><strong>Right to Know vs. National Security</strong></li>
<li><strong>Erosion of Public Confidence</strong> in the Judicial System</li>
<li><strong>The principles of natural justice and the fundamental right</strong> to <strong>know</strong> cannot be taken away by the state</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The debate on sealed covers should focus on how to strike a balance between the public’s right to know and the necessity to preserve national security.</p>

<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Indian economy and related issues</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/explained-how-is-the-stock-market-regulated-in-india/article66526291.ece#:~:text=governing%20the%20market%3F-,The%20securities%20market%20in%20India%20is%20regulated%20by%20four%20key,and%20the%20Depositories%20Act%2C%201996."><strong>TH</strong></a> </p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The SC recently asked the SEBI and the government to produce the existing regulatory framework in place to protect investors from share market volatility. </p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This followed the <strong>Hindenburg Research report</strong>, which accused the Adani Group of stock market manipulation and accounting fraud.</li>
<li><strong>A share/a stock market</strong> is a component of a free-market economy, where various kinds of stock shares/bonds/securities are traded.</li>
<li>It allows companies <strong>to raise money</strong> and investors to participate in the financial achievements of the companies, makes profits through capital gains, and earn income through dividends. </li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/stock_mrket.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/stock_mrket.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>The securities market in India is regulated by four key laws:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Companies Act, 2013:</strong> It regulates the incorporation of a company, responsibilities of a company, directors, and dissolution of a company.</li>
<li><strong>The Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992:</strong> It empowers SEBI to register intermediaries like stock brokers, merchant bankers, and portfolio managers, regulate their functioning, impose penalties including suspending/cancelling the registration</li>
<li><strong>The Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (SCRA):</strong> It empowers SEBI to recognise (and derecognise) stock exchanges, prescribe rules and bye-laws for their functioning, and regulate trading, clearing and settlement on stock exchanges.</li>
<li><strong>The Depositories Act, 1996:</strong> It introduced and legitimised the concept of dematerialised securities being held in an electronic form. SEBI set up the infrastructure for doing this by registering depositories and depository participants.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Can SEBI step in to curb market volatility?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While SEBI does not interfere to prevent market volatility, <strong>exchanges have circuit filters</strong> (upper and lower) to prevent excessive volatility.</li>
<li><strong>But SEBI can issue directions</strong> to stock exchanges to stop trading, totally or selectively.</li>
<li>It can also <strong>prohibit entities or persons from buying, selling or dealing in securities</strong>, or from raising funds from the market.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are the guidelines for fundraising?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Companies Act</strong> has delegated the authority to enforce some of its provisions to <strong>SEBI</strong>, including the regulation of raising capital, corporate governance, resolution of investor grievances, etc.</li>
<li>As a result, <strong>SEBI issued guidelines</strong> such as the Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirement Regulations, the Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements Regulations (2015), etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are the safeguards against fraud?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fraud undermines regulation and <strong>prevents a market from being fair and transparent</strong>.</li>
<li>SEBI notified the <strong>Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices</strong> Regulations (1995) and the <strong>Prohibition of Insider Trading</strong> Regulations (1992).</li>
<li>These regulations <strong>define different types of fraud</strong>, and provide for penalties and violation of these regulations is a presumed violation of the <strong>Prevention of Money Laundering Act</strong>.</li>
<li>SEBI has been given the <strong>powers of a civil court</strong> and using these powers, SEBI has acted against Satyam, Sahara India, Ketan Parekh and Vijay Mallya.</li>
<li><strong>Appeals</strong> – SEBI order → Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) → SC</li>
</ul>
<p>Related news: SEBI has mandated stock brokers, and depository participants to maintain a website to help investors</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/sebi-mandates-stock-brokers-depository-website-8450531/#:~:text=Sebi%20has%20mandated%20these%20entities,better%20services%20to%20the%20investors."><strong>IE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The capital markets regulator SEBI has recently asked stock brokers and depository participants to maintain a website.</p>
<p><strong>A stockbroker</strong> (registered with SEBI) is a member of a recognised stock exchange, who is permitted to do trades on the screen-based trading system of different stock exchanges.</p>
<p><strong>A depository</strong> is an organisation which holds securities (like shares, debentures, bonds, etc.) of investors in electronic form at the request of the investors through a registered depository participant.</p>
<p><strong>A depository participant</strong> is an agent of the depository – National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL) and Central Depository Services (India) Ltd (CDSL) – through which it interfaces with the investor and provides depository services.</p>
<p><strong>The rationale behind the website:</strong> It will contain basic details such as their registered address, and the registration number, and <strong>give customers relevant information right</strong> from the process of opening an account to filing a complaint.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Avian influenza (H5N1) or <strong>bird flu</strong> has caused unprecedented loss of tens of thousands of birds at Bass Rock, an island off the coast of North Berwick, Scotland.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/bird_flu_1.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/bird_flu_1.jpg?is-pending-load=1" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Avian Influenza in India:</strong> The <strong>latest major avian flu outbreak in 2020-2021</strong> swept through many States causing mass mortality of wild birds.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges for India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>India is <strong>a major wintering ground</strong> for many waterfowl that rely on the central Asian Flyway.</li>
<li><strong>Fastest growing egg producer</strong> in the world.</li>
<li>Unlike in Europe, <strong>poultry birds here are not vaccinated against the flu</strong>.</li>
<li>Farms with a <strong>diversity of animals or in the vicinity</strong> of wetlands increase the potential for the viruses to generate more virulent strains – H5N1/H7N9 – <strong>which could infect humans.</strong></li>
<li><strong>There is no active surveillance</strong> in the poultry sector.</li>
<li><strong>There is no efficient mechanism</strong> for how wetland and waterfowl habitats at the interface of poultry need to be monitored.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Environmental surveillance – Meaning and need:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Meaning:</strong> It can improve knowledge of the presence and diversity of avian influenza viruses in domestic flocks that are allowed to roam/in confinement where waste products like faeces, etc. are released into the environment.</p>
<p><strong>N</strong><strong>eed:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Birds infected with the virus <strong>shed large quantities of virus</strong> in their faeces, saliva, and nasal secretions for about a week.</li>
<li><strong>Zoonotic potential:</strong><ul>
<li>Transmission from dead birds to scavenging animals such as sea lions, and foxes, has posed serious risks.</li>
<li>Recently, the intra-mammal transmission of H5N1 (in mink farms) was recorded.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Lakes and wetlands can act as environmental reservoirs</strong> for several months.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong> An active and passive year-round surveillance network under <strong>One Health</strong> which connects monitoring of humans and animals in a shared environment.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Currently, virus surveillance relies on sampling dead birds. Therefore, environmental surveillance would be a great non-invasive tool that can be done without disturbing the birds and can be used to obtain both host and viral genetic material.</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: With the Line of Actual Control remaining tense, <strong>India is raising seven new battalions of the famed patrol force ITBP</strong>, for ‘<strong>effective monitoring’</strong> of the border region.</p>
<p><strong>New Battalions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The battalions <strong>are expected to be raised by 2025-26</strong>, increasing the strength of the ITBP from the current 88,000 to 97,000, <strong>making it the fourth largest CAPF.</strong></li>
<li>The last time ITBP battalions were raised was in 2011.</li>

<p><strong>Odisha</strong> in India has been successful in <strong>reducing child marriage</strong> rates through a long-term strategy that involves:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tracking the absence of girls</strong> in schools and villages</li>
<li><strong>Counselling</strong> by representatives of district administration</li>
<li><strong>Linking all schemes targeting girls</strong> on a platform called <strong>‘Advika – Every Girl is Unique</strong>.’</li>
<li><strong>Monetary incentives</strong> to vulnerable tribal groups</li>
<li><strong>Child-friendly policing</strong> and sensitization week</li>
<li><strong>Community efforts for behavioural changes:</strong> Representatives of the panchayat, parents, and children conduct monthly meetings in the community to discuss dropping out from school and child marriages</li>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> The City Council in Seattle (USA) will vote on a law, to ban caste discrimination in employment and housing, retail, public accommodation, and transportation.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Institutions of higher education across the USA have added caste to their non-discrimination policies.</p>
<p><strong>Example 3:</strong> A report in Spain has recommended Spanish Government the equal treatment and opportunities for the <strong>Roma</strong> to build a better society and eradicate <strong>Anti-Gypsy sentiments</strong>. The position of the Roma in Europe is similar to that of the <strong>Dalits</strong> in India.</p>
<p>Bottom of Form</p>
<p><strong>Lessons from the above examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discrimination and marginalization</strong> based on caste or ethnicity are still prevalent in various parts of the world, including the US and Europe.</li>
<li><strong>Grassroots movements and advocacy efforts</strong> can raise awareness and drive positive change to combat discrimination and social injustice.</li>
<li><strong>Non-discrimination policies</strong> at the institutional level can help to create a more inclusive society.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Usage:</strong> Such examples can be used in Essay/Ethics/ Society/ Social Justice to show that caste-based discrimination is prevalent throughout the world and there is a need for concerted global efforts to eradicate such biases.</p>

<p><strong>Living Carbon</strong>, a San Francisco-based biotech firm, has planted genetically modified (GM) <strong>poplar trees</strong> that grow wood at a <strong>much faster rate</strong> and absorb more CO2 than normal trees.</p>
<ul>
<li>The company used a technique known as the <strong>gene gun method</strong> to insert foreign genes into the trees’ chromosomes.</li>
<li><strong>Threats</strong>: Critics have warned they could be a “growing threat” to forests biodiversity, and the government has allowed the trees to evade regulation.</li>
<li>To date, the only country where large numbers of GM trees have been planted in <strong>China</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Usage</strong>: This example can be used to show innovative techniques to sequester carbon, but it can also be used to show ethical, environmental, and regulatory issues with the bio-engineering of plants.</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: As per a recent study, the rising anthropogenic (man-made) underwater noise emissions (UNE) from ships in Indian waters, pose a threat to the life of marine mammals.</p>
<p><strong>Importance of Sound for Marine Animals</strong>: All Marine Mammals (like Bottlenose Dolphin, Manatees, Pilot Whale, Seal, and Sperm) use sound for mating, communal interaction, feeding, cluster cohesion and foraging</p>
<p><strong>Threats</strong>: The sound that radiates from ships on a long-term basis affects their behavioural activities, and also results in internal injuries, loss of hearing ability, masking, and stress</p>
<ul>
<li>Change the migration route of marine species to shallow regions, leading to <strong>stranding</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>UNE in Indian waters:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is measured to be between 102-115 decibels</li>
<li>East Coast sound level is slightly higher than the West</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Major Contributors to UNE:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Natural</strong>: Earthquakes, Weather, and Sound released by marine animals</li>
<li><strong>Anthropogenic</strong>:<ul>
<li>Continuous shipping movement is identified to be a significant contributor to the increase in the global ocean noise level.</li>
<li>The noise generated by ships is caused by their engines, propellers, and other machinery, and it can travel long distances through the water</li>
