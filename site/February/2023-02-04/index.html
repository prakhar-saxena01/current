<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Parliament – Structure, Functioning, Conduct of Business, Powers &amp; Privileges and Issues Arising out of this/Separation of Powers</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/parliament-is-the-north-star-of-democracy-vice-president/article66467335.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a> </p>
<p><strong>Direction:</strong> The controversy over whether the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/13/basic-structure-doctrine/">Basic Structure Doctrine</a> or Parliament is the “north star” of democracy is highlighted in the article.</p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Stepping up the legislature versus judiciary debate, the Vice President and Rajya Sabha Chairman during the Parliament’s sitting stated that <strong>Parliament is the “north star” of democracy.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Polaris/North Star</strong> stays in roughly the same place in the sky – directly above Earth’s north pole, and therefore it’s a reliable way to find the direction of the north.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This comes days after the CJI‘s statement, <strong>calling the</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/26/master-the-basic-structure-doctrine-for-upsc-cse-with-i-pen/"><strong>basic structure</strong></a> <strong>doctrine a “north star”</strong> that gives direction to interpreters and implementers of the Constitution.</li>
<li>The VP has been <strong>consistent in criticising the judiciary</strong> for “overstepping its boundaries” and has also <strong>questioned the landmark 1973</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/04/28/basic-structure-and-the-kesavananda-bharati-case-2/"><strong>Kesavananda Bharati</strong></a> <strong>case</strong> verdict on the basic structure doctrine.</li>
<li>According to the VP, the <strong>verdict had set a “bad precedent”</strong> and if any authority questions Parliament’s power to amend the Constitution, it would be difficult to say we are a democratic nation.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/parliamentary.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/parliamentary.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Role of the</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/parliament-and-state-legislatures/"><strong>Parliament</strong></a><strong>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Parliament is the <strong>essence of democracy</strong> – participation by people in the decision-making process and government by consent.</li>
<li>It is a place for <strong>debate/discussion/deliberation</strong> to realise the aspirations and dreams of the people.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Functions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To Select the National Government</li>
<li>To Control, Guide and Inform the Government</li>
<li>Law-Making</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Issues faced by the Indian Parliament:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While the Parliament’s productivity has gone up, it faces several challenges –<ul>
<li><strong>Frequent disruptions</strong></li>
<li>Sharply dipping the number of bills being referred to parliamentary committees;</li>
<li><strong>Shrinking space for the opposition;</strong></li>
<li>Increasing recourse to ordinances; and</li>
<li>T<strong>he bypassing of the Parliament</strong> on several important initiatives.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/structure-organization-and-functioning-of-the/judiciary/judicial-activism-and-judicial-over-reach/"><strong>Judicial activism</strong></a> or the judiciary’s proactive engagement in defending citizens’ rights, is a practice born out of the Indian Parliament’s inefficiency and inaction.</li>
<li>As a result, there is debate over whether the Judiciary (SC, HCs) or Parliament should have the upper hand.</li>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>The Parliament is the <strong>essence</strong> of democracy, while the basic structure doctrine is the <strong>bedrock</strong> and spirit of democracy and we all are <strong>soldiers</strong> of democracy. Therefore, all have a <strong>defined role to play in a Parliamentary democracy like India.</strong></p>

<p>We adopted <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/07/18/editorial-analysis-preserving-democracy-in-india/">parliamentary democracy</a> based on the British model, but how does our model differ from that model?</p>
<ol>
<li>As regards legislation, the British Parliament is supreme or sovereign but in India, the power of the parliament to legislate is limited.</li>
<li>In India, matters related to the constitutionality of the Amendment of an Act of Parliament are referred to the Constitution Bench by the Supreme Court.</li>

<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Issues relating to Education/Health/Poverty/Hunger</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/poor-literacy-linked-to-worse-mental-health-problems-study/article66439128.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>According to a recent study in India, people with poor literacy face more mental health problems such as loneliness, depression and anxiety.</li>
<li>It is the first such study to look at the <strong>global picture of literacy and mental health.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Highlights of the study:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Despite rising literacy rates over the past 50 years, there are still an <strong>estimated 773 million adults globally</strong> who can’t read or write.</li>
<li>Literacy rates are <strong>lower in developing countries</strong> and those with a history of conflict, and <strong>women,</strong> who account for two-thirds of the world’s illiterate, <strong>are disproportionately affected</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>People with more literacy tend to have better social outcomes</strong> in terms of finding employment, being paid well, and being able to afford better food and housing.</li>
<li>Lower literacy is related to <strong>poorer health, chronic diseases and shorter life expectancy.</strong></li>
<li>Thus, little or no literacy <strong>holds a person back</strong> throughout their life and they often become trapped in <strong>poverty or more likely to commit a crime</strong>.</li>

<ul>
<li>People with <strong>lower literacy had greater mental health difficulties</strong> such as anxiety and depression.</li>
<li>Literacy may be impacted by a number of factors, <strong>such as</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/indian-economy-3/poverty-and-unemployment/poverty/"><strong>poverty</strong></a> <strong>or living in a region with a history of conflict</strong>, which can affect mental health.</li>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/podcast/generative-ai-what-are-the-potential-applications-and-ethical-concerns-in-focus-podcast/article66408419.ece"><strong>The Hindu</strong></a><strong>,</strong> <a href="https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1896016"><strong>PIB</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Direction:</strong> We had already covered <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/01/12/generative-ai/">Generative AI previously</a>; the points given here are only the unique points that we didn’t cover previously.</p>
<p><strong>What is Generative AI:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Generative Artificial Intelligence refers to the <strong>capability of artificial intelligence-enabled machines to use existing text, audio files, or images to create new content.</strong></li>
<li>The software uses <strong>complex machine learning models to predict the next word based on previous word sequences, or the next image based on words describing previous images</strong>. “<strong>Large language model”</strong> – LLMs began at Google Brain in 2017, where they were initially used for the translation of words while preserving context.</li>
<li>Since then, <strong>large language and text-to-image models</strong> have proliferated at leading tech firms including <strong>Google (BERT and LaMDA), Facebook (OPT-175B, BlenderBot), and OpenAI, a nonprofit in which Microsoft is the dominant investor (GPT-3 for text, DALL-E2 for images, and Whisper for speech).</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefits of</strong> <strong>Generative AI:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automated content generation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Improved content quality</strong></li>
<li><strong>Increased content variety</strong></li>
<li><strong>Personalized content</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Generative Adversarial Network:</strong></p>
<p>A generative adversarial network (GAN) is a <strong>machine learning (ML) model</strong> in which two <strong>neural networks compete with each other</strong> to become more accurate in their predictions. GANs typically run <strong>unsupervised and use a cooperative zero-sum game framework to learn.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/03/19/insights-into-editorial-responsible-ai-the-need-for-ethical-guard-rails/"><strong>Ethical concerns</strong></a> <strong>associated with Generative AI:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bias and Discrimination</strong>: AI models can perpetuate and amplify biases in their training data, leading to <strong>discriminatory outcomes and unjust decisions</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Responsibility and accountability</strong></li>
<li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Generative AI models have the <strong>potential to collect and generate vast amounts of personal data, which can raise privacy concerns.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ownership and control</strong></li>
<li><strong>Fairness and transparency</strong>: AI models can make decisions <strong>that lack transparency and fairness</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Job displacement</strong></li>
<li><strong>Misuse</strong>: AI models can be used for <strong>malicious purposes,</strong> such as <strong>creating fake news or deep fakes, or spreading hate speech.</strong></li>
<li>Top of Form</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Indian Initiatives for Generative AI:</strong></p>
<ul>

<p><strong>Direction:</strong> The article covers initiatives taken by India to promote <strong>Green Growth</strong> &amp; highlights proposals in the Union Budget in this regard.</p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Finance Minister’s latest <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/02/budget-new-schemes-announced-and-old-schemes-emphasized/">Union Budget 2023-24</a> has laid emphasis on the <strong>government’s commitment to move towards net-zero carbon emission by 2070</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>According to the World Economic Forum (WEF), <strong>India holds the key to hitting global climate change targets given its sizeable and growing energy needs</strong>.</li>
<li>With the country’s <strong>population set to overtake China’s</strong> sometime this year, <strong>India’s appetite for energy</strong> to propel the economy is set to surge exponentially.</li>
<li><strong>The transition to green alternatives</strong> from the current reliance on fossil fuels is therefore an <strong>urgent imperative</strong>, as it creates <strong>an opportunity</strong> to launch new sectors and boost GDP.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Union Budget 2023-24 announcements:</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/green.png"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/green.png?is-pending-load=1" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Green Growth:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is one of the <strong>7 priorities (</strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/02/what-are-the-saptarishi-initiatives-for-amrit-kaal-announced-in-the-union-budget-2023-24-discuss-the-ways-in-which-the-country-can-achieve-green-growth-as-it-moves/"><strong>Saptarishi</strong></a> <strong>of Amrit Kaal)</strong> the Budget. India is implementing many programmes for –<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/06/03/insights-editorial-analysis-green-hydrogen-fuel-of-the-future/">Green fuel</a>, green energy, green farming, green mobility, <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/02/17/what-are-green-buildings-do-you-think-innovation-in-green-buildings-can-help-address-the-carbon-challenge-and-harness-an-opportunity-for-sustainable-development-explain/">green buildings</a>, green equipment and policies for efficient use of energy across various economic sectors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>These green growth efforts help in <strong>reducing the carbon intensity of the economy and provide for large-scale green job opportunities.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Electric-Vehicles-in-India.pdf"><strong>Electric vehicle (EV)</strong></a><strong>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The availability of locally produced <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/06/09/lithium/"><strong>lithium-ion batteries</strong></a> has become essential, especially to reduce the cost of EVs.</li>
<li>The Budget proposes –<ul>
<li><strong>To exempt customs duty on the import</strong> of capital goods and machinery required to manufacture lithium-ion cells.</li>
<li>The <strong>establishment of a viability gap funding mechanism</strong> to support the creation of battery energy storage systems with a capacity of 4,000 MWh.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Energy storage systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Battery storage systems <strong>help to ensure that the electricity produced at peak output</strong> by wind and solar projects is stored and then supplied to match the demand.</li>
<li>The Budget set aside a vital ₹8,300 crore towards a ₹20,700 crore project for building an <strong>inter-State transmission system for the evacuation</strong> and <strong>grid integration</strong> of 13 GW of renewable energy from <strong>Ladakh</strong>.</li>
<li>The transmission line will help address hurdles in setting up solar capacity in the region, given its remoteness from India’s main power grid.</li>

<li>The health ministry will now screen all tribals in the country <strong>below 40 years</strong> and give them identity cards based on their sickle cell anaemia status (<strong>Unmukt Project</strong> of the central government )</li>
<li><strong>The colour-coded cards</strong> can be <strong>matched before marriage</strong> to understand the <strong>risk of sickle cell disease</strong> in the child born from the union</li>
<li><strong>Prevalence</strong>: There are approximately <strong>200 districts in the country</strong> where the disease is prevalent, mostly in Maharashtra. Madhya Pradesh, Chattisgarh, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Odisha.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Sickle cell disease:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Sickle cell disease</strong> is a genetic condition that affects haemoglobin — responsible for carrying oxygen in the body– in red blood cells.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It is inherited when a child receives two genes</strong>—one from each parent—that code for <strong>abnormal haemoglobin</strong></li>
<li>It is prevalent among the <strong>tribal population in India</strong></li>
<li>It can lead to problems such as <strong>Anaemia, debilitating acute and chronic pain, infection, acute chest syndrome</strong>, stroke, and renal failure are among the problems it can lead to.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Initiatives by Tribal Ministry:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tribal Affairs Ministry <strong>established the National Council on Sickle Cell Disease and Tribal Health Cell</strong></li>
<li>The Tribal Affairs Ministry,  through the development of the <strong>Sickle Cell Support Corner</strong>, has instituted a mechanism for creating a <strong>Central Repository of data</strong></li>

<p>Space debris is defunct human-made objects in space—principally in Earth orbit—which no longer serve a useful function</p>
<ul>
<li>The real amount of space debris is said to be <strong>between 500,000 and one million pieces</strong> as current sensor technology cannot detect smaller objects.</li>
<li>They orbit at high speed in Low Earth Orbit (LEO)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The threat of Kessler Syndrome?</strong></p>
<p>The Kessler Syndrome is a theoretical scenario in which Earth’s orbit is overpopulated with objects and debris, preventing the use of satellites in certain sections of Earth’s orbit.</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: Scientists have <strong>fashioned a previously unknown form of ice</strong> – one that might <strong>exist on our solar system’s icy moons</strong> – in research that <strong>sheds light on water’s behaviour under extreme conditions</strong> using a <strong>device that might be described as a super-duper cocktail shaker.</strong></p>
<p><strong>How was it made:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The researchers said they employed a <strong>process called ball milling</strong> to vigorously <strong>shake ordinary ice</strong> together <strong>with steel balls in a container</strong> cooled to <strong>minus-328 degrees Fahrenheit</strong> (minus-200 degrees Celsius).</li>
<li>This yielded what they called <strong>“medium-density amorphous ice,” or MDA, which looked like a fine white powder.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Its characteristics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ordinary ice is crystalline in nature, with water molecules – two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, or H2O – arranged in a regular pattern. <strong>Amorphous ice’s water molecules are in a disorganized form resembling a liquid.</strong></li>
<li>Amorphous ice is <strong>by far the most common form of water in space</strong>. Scientists have identified 20 different forms of crystalline ice and <strong>three forms of amorphous ice – one low density (discovered in the 1930s), one high density (discovered in the 1980s), and the new one in between</strong>.</li>
<li>Almost all ice in the <strong>universe is amorphous and in a form called low-density amorphous ice</strong>. This forms when water <strong>condenses onto dust grains in space</strong>. Comets are amorphous ice as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>key significance of the discovery</strong> of a new form of ice with a density similar to liquid water is that it could serve as an ideal model for understanding the properties of water without the complexities introduced by its fluid motion.</p>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1895719"><strong>PIB</strong></a> </p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Scientists have traced the <strong>mechanisms of the toxic action of cobra venom</strong>, paving a path towards <strong>developing strategies for the application of antivenom</strong> or small molecule inhibitors, which can <strong>help mitigate the local toxic effects of cobra venom retained at the bite site.</strong></p>
<p><strong>About Cobras:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cobras (genus Naja</strong>) are widely distributed over <strong>Asia and Africa</strong>, and cobra bites are responsible for large <strong>mortality and morbidity</strong>. Like other elapid venoms, <strong>cobra venoms are neurotoxic in nature.</strong> However, they also exhibit local <strong>cytotoxic effects at the envenomed site</strong>.</li>
<li>Cytotoxins (CTXs) are an essential class of the <strong>non-enzymatic three-finger toxin family</strong> and are present in cobra venoms. <strong>CTXs are also responsible for depolarizing neurons and heart muscle membranes.</strong></li>

<p><strong>C</strong><strong>ontext</strong>: February 2 is marked as World <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/unique-ecosystems-degradation-and-management/wetland-ecosystem/">Wetlands</a> Day. <strong>‘Revive and restore degraded wetlands’</strong> is the theme for this World Wetlands Day.</p>
<ul>
<li>In a belated but welcome move, Finance Minister <strong>Nirmala Sitharaman announced a special scheme called ‘Amrit Dharohar’</strong> for protecting <strong>India’s wetlands in the</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/02/02/union-budget-2023-24/"><strong>Union Budget 2023</strong></a>.</li>
<li>A separate scheme for mangrove conservation, <strong>‘Mangrove Initiative for Shoreline Habitats &amp; Tangible Incomes’, (MISHTI)</strong> was also announced as part of the <strong>green growth priority of the Budget.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Wetlands:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A broad definition of wetlands includes both <strong>freshwater and marine and coastal ecosystems such as lakes and rivers, swamps and marshes, wet grasslands, peatlands, estuaries, tidal flats, mangroves, coral reefs, and all human-made sites such as fishponds, rice paddies, reservoirs, and saltpans</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefits of Wetlands:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Wetlands absorb <strong>carbon dioxide and help slow global warming and reduce pollution</strong>, hence, they are referred to as the <strong>‘Kidneys of the Earth’.</strong></li>
<li>Wetlands also provide a <strong>buffer against the impacts of floods, droughts, hurricanes, and tsunamis, and build resilience to Climate Change</strong>.</li>
