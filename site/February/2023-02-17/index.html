<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/world/covid-19-damaged-cognitive-development-lifetime-earnings-of-an-entire-generation-finds-word-bank-87752"><strong>DTE</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> A new World Bank report titled “<strong>Collapse and Recovery: How COVID-19 Eroded Human Capital and What to Do about It “-</strong> provides the first comprehensive <strong>review of global data for young people who were under the age of 25 during the pandemic.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It analyzed global data on the <strong>pandemic’s impacts on young people</strong> at key developmental stages: <strong>early childhood (0-5 years), school age (6-14 years) and youth (15-24 years).</strong></li>
<li>It shows that the COVID-19 pandemic <strong>disrupted human capital accumulation at critical moments in the life cycle</strong> of children and young <strong>people in low- and middle-income countries.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Findings of the report:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Missed vaccinations and health care</strong>: Millions of children faced <strong>reductions in health care</strong>—including <strong>missed critical vaccines</strong>. They also faced more <strong>stress in their care environment</strong>s—<strong>orphanhood, domestic violence, and suboptimal nutrition</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Learning loss: Preschool-age children</strong> in multiple countries lost more than <strong>34 per cent of learning in early language</strong> and literacy and more than <strong>29 per cent of learning in math</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>School closures and ineffective remote</strong> learning: caused students to <strong>miss out on learning and to forget what they had learned:</strong> on average, for every 30 days of school closures, students lost about 32 days of learning.</li>
<li><strong>youth unemployment:</strong>40 million people, who would have had a job in the absence of the pandemic, did not have one at the end of 2021, <strong>worsening youth unemployment trends</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Countries can and should act urgently to <strong>recover these losses and invest better in their people</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Gaps will widen over time if not addressed.</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Immediate policy actions suggested in the report:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vaccinations and nutritional supplementation campaigns;</strong> <strong>increasing coverage of parenting programs;</strong> increasing access to <strong>pre-primary education</strong>, expanding coverage of cash transfers for vulnerable families.</li>
<li><strong>Increasing instructional time</strong>; assessing learning and matching instruction to students’ learning level; and streamlining the curriculum to focus on foundational learning.</li>
<li>For youth, <strong>support for adapted training, job intermediation, entrepreneurship programs</strong>, and new workforce-oriented initiatives are crucial.</li>
<li>In the longer term, <strong>countries need to build agile, resilient, and adaptive human development systems</strong> that can better prepare for and respond to current and future shocks.</li>
<li><strong>Collapse and Recovery recognize</strong> the need for countries to prioritize among the long list of potential crisis recovery policies and offers an approach for doing so that takes into account the extent of the collapse, complexity and cost of implementation, and political commitment.</li>

<h4 id="gs-paper-2_1"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus: Government Policies</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source</strong>: <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/govt-ends-age-65-cap-for-receiving-organ-from-dead-donor-eases-rules-8449964/#:~:text=The%20Union%20Health%20Ministry%20has,to%20register%20on%20waiting%20lists.">IE</a>, <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/now-no-age-bar-to-register-for-cadaver-organ-transplants/article66517670.ece">Th</a></p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: The Union Health Ministry has done away with the <strong>age cap of 65 years</strong> for receiving an organ from a dead donor (cadaver).</p>
<p><strong>What do the new guidelines say:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Elderly can now register to receive organs from deceased donors</strong><ul>
<li>Previously, <strong>NOTTO</strong> (National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation) guidelines barred them. This violated the Right to Life of elderly</li>
<li>Preference will <strong>still be given to younger recipients</strong>, those above the age of 65 will not be completely barred from the process</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>A patient irrespective</strong> of <strong>domicile State can register</strong> in any other State for a transplant (previously a domicile certificate was necessary)</li>
<li>The patient will be allotted a <strong>unique ID</strong> by NOTTO upon registering. This will help in charting a <strong>‘One Nation One Policy,</strong>’ for organ donation and transplantation</li>
<li><strong>Health Ministry</strong> has intimated states to <strong>stop charging registration</strong> fees to patients.</li>
<li><strong>For awareness generation</strong>: The government is introducing a <strong>chapter in the school curriculum</strong> regarding organ donation awareness for students.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Status of Organ Donation in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>India conducts the <strong>third-highest number of transplants</strong> in the world. Every year, an estimated <strong>5-2 lakh</strong> people need a kidney transplant.</li>
<li>Organs from <strong>deceased</strong> donors accounted for nearly <strong>18% of all transplants in 2022</strong> in the country</li>
<li>Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Karnataka account for more than <strong>85% of the total deceased donations</strong>.</li>
<li>A study shows over <strong>40% of those in need of kidney transplants</strong> worldwide are over the age of 65.</li>
<li><strong>As per the Health Ministry</strong>, the number of organ transplants has increased by <strong>over three times</strong> from 4,990 in 2013 to 15,561 in 2022.</li>
<li>India has an organ donation rate of about <strong>52 per million population</strong>. In comparison, the organ donation rate in Spain is <strong>49.6 per million</strong> population which is the highest in the world.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The current mechanism of Donating organs</strong>: The availability of an organ is reported by the hospital to the state organ and tissue transplant organisation that matches it with recipients locally. If a match isn’t found, it is referred to the regional office and then to NOTTO</p>
<p><strong>Measures that can be taken:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Employ more transplant coordinators</strong> (to explain and guide the families through the process of donation)</li>
<li><strong>Introduce Opt-out system</strong>: In India consent of family members is mandatory. Spain has an opt-out system where a person is presumed to be a donor unless otherwise specified.</li>
<li><strong>Generate more awareness</strong> about organ transplants so that people register as donors.</li>
<li><strong>Have faith</strong> that the donated organs are helping others.</li>
<li><strong>Use of technology</strong>g. Drones to transport organs between cities and states</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About NOTTO:</strong></p>
<p><strong>National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization (NOTTO)</strong> is a national-level organisation set up under the Directorate General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.</p>

<p><strong>Syllabus: Indian Economy, development and employment</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/opinion/r-d-an-inside-job-123021501955_1.html"><strong>BS</strong></a> </p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The article highlights the need for in-house Research and Development</p>
<p><strong>Status of R&amp;D:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Global:</strong><ul>
<li>World invests a little over <strong>2% of gross domestic product</strong> (GDP) in R&amp;D (around $2 trillion)</li>
<li><strong>Top five countries in R&amp;D:</strong> US, China, Japan, Germany and South Korea (they combined to account for three-quarters)</li>
<li><strong>Top five industries:</strong> Pharmaceuticals, automobiles, technology hardware, software and electronics (they together account for almost 73% of all industrial R&amp;D)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>India:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>India is the world’s fifth-largest economy</strong>. But in total R&amp;D investment, India ranked 16th, below Israel.</li>
<li>Indian firms invest <strong>3% of GDP</strong> in in-house R&amp;D, compared to a world average of <strong>1.5%.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The European Commission report</strong> stated that India <strong>has only 24 firm</strong>s among the top 2,500 investors in R&amp;D worldwide.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reasons for low industrial R&amp;D investment in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>India’s limited presence in top sectors:</strong> India has no firms in five of the 10 top industrial sectors such as technology hardware, electronic equipment, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Firms don’t invest enough</strong>: India’s top-ranked R&amp;D investment firm is Tata Motors with an annual R&amp;D spend of <strong>$3.5 billion</strong> But at the global level, it stands only at the 58th position.</li>
<li><strong>Smaller sizes and lower technology levels of Indian firms</strong>: Indian software firms are service firms to the world’s product firms.<ul>
<li>India’s top 10 software firms invest only 1% in R&amp;D compared to 8% in China.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Measures taken:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Setting up Research Parks and Technology Business Incubators (TBIs)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Providing tax incentives and a negative list of imports (esp. in the defence sector) for promoting R&amp;D activities</strong></li>
<li><strong>Technology partnership/ Transfer of technology</strong>g. in the Space and defence sector</li>
<li><strong>Setting up Innovation Clusters</strong></li>
<li><strong>National Research Foundation</strong>: To fund competitive, peer-reviewed grant proposals from universities, colleges, and institutions of higher learning.</li>
<li><strong>IMPRINT initiative</strong>: To provide solutions in 10 selected technology domains.</li>
<li><strong>Atal Tinkering Labs</strong>: It aims to foster curiosity, creativity and imagination in young minds; and inculcate skills such as design mindset, computational thinking, adaptive learning etc.</li>
<li><strong>IPR Laws:</strong> India is a signatory to TRIPS and has enacted its domestic IPR laws to foster IPR creation and curtail its violation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Measures needed:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Institutional Changes</strong>: India needs to drive change in industrial structure, use trade policy to force competition between Indian firms, and drastically reform India’s public research system.</li>
<li><strong>A minimum percentage of the turnover of the company</strong> may be invested in R&amp;D by medium and large enterprises registered in India.</li>
<li><strong>Creating 30 dedicated R&amp;D Exports Hub</strong>(by Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM))</li>
<li><strong>Utilise talents of youth:</strong> Out of 100 top forms in R&amp;D, over two-thirds of them have R&amp;D centres in India. Hence, India should train and expose fresh engineers</li>
<li><strong>Line ministries</strong> at the Centre could be <strong>mandated to allocate a certain percentage of their budget</strong> for research and innovation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>India should target to reach at <strong>least 2% of the Gross Domestic Product</strong> (GDP) from the current about <strong>0.7% (Economic Survey 2020-21)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Sophie Howe, the first Future Generations Commissioner in the world</strong>, has been tasked with protecting <strong>the interests of future generations</strong> in Wales (UK), advising the government on long-term thinking and climate change.</p>
<p><strong>Her role:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>She will represent those <strong>who will be born in the coming decades and centuries</strong>.</li>
<li>Although there is <strong>no obligation to follow the commissioner’s recommendations</strong>, public bodies must respond and explain why they are not following them</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The wellbeing of future generations act passed by the Welsh government in 2015</strong>, requires all public bodies to demonstrate how their decisions support <strong>sustainability</strong>, without compromising the needs of future generations.</p>
<p>The idea of having a <strong>future generations commissioner</strong> is spreading, and <strong>Gibraltar</strong> now has a similar commissioner, with bills being developed in the UK, Irish and Scottish parliaments. The UN also plans to appoint one.</p>
<p><strong>Usage</strong>: The fact can be used to show the need to take innovative steps for including sustainability in our development and attain <strong>‘Climate Justice’</strong> for the future generation</p>

<p><strong>Low-lying island countries like Maldives</strong> are threatened by sea level rise. A new study has shown that raising the height of low-lying island countries, like the Maldives, to cope with sea-level rise is an efficient approach to prevent the loss of culture, identity, integration, and livelihoods brought on by relocation to other countries</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The use of simple engineering techniques</strong>, such as elevating islands threatened by submergence and creating new islands where people can be moved, can help small island nations like the Maldives.</li>
<li>The report suggests that the <strong>entire population of the Maldives</strong> could live on just two elevated islands to withstand sea-level rise.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Usage</strong>: It can be used as an innovative solution for saving the low-lying Island nation from being submerged due to sea level rise.</p>

<p><strong>Australian Conservation biologist Matt Stephens</strong> invented the <strong>Hollowhog tool</strong> to create new homes for Australia’s endangered wildlife in the <strong>forested Sun Valley (Australia)</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Australia’s fauna is losing habitat due to <strong>logging and bushfires</strong>, which affects hundreds of threatened animal species that live in the hollows of trees.</li>
<li>A hollow carved by the <strong>tungsten blade</strong> of a Hollowhog tool can create a hollow in less than an hour that can last for hundreds of years.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Usage</strong>: This is a unique tool for creating a habitat for fauna. It can be used in environement mains questions or essays.</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: Amazon and Google are among 32 firms that have been given in-principle approval by the <strong>Reserve Bank of India (RBI)</strong> to operate as online payment aggregators</p>
<p><strong>What are Payment Aggregators?</strong> </p>
<p>They are the entities that facilitate <strong>e-commerce sites and merchants</strong> to accept various payment instruments such as cash/cheques, and online payments from customers for completion of their payment requirements.</p>
<ul>
<li>PA receive payments from <strong>customers, and pool and transfer</strong> them to the merchants after a time period.</li>
<li><strong>The central bank introduced</strong> a framework for PA in March 2020.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How it is different from Payment Gateways?</strong></p>
<p>A payment gateway is an intermediary and provides a tool for the payment aggregator to complete the transactions. They don’t directly handle any funds (see image for more clarity)</p>
<p><strong>RBI norms for a company applying for aggregator authorisation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It must have a minimum net worth of <strong>Rs 15 crore</strong> in the first year of application (March 2021), and at least Rs 25 crore by the second year (March 2023)</li>
<li>It also must fulfil the <strong>“fit and proper” criteria</strong>, and be compliant with global payment security standards.</li>
<li>It shall be a <strong>company incorporated</strong> under the Companies Act, 2013</li>
<li>A formal publicly disclosed <strong>customer grievance redressal and dispute management framework</strong> be established with a Nodal officer</li>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: Physicists have recently made the m<strong>ost precise test yet of the Standard Model of particle physics</strong>, which predicts the properties of all subatomic particles, by measuring the <strong>electron’s magnetic moment with 0.13 parts per trillion accuracies</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The measurement is <strong>2.</strong><strong>2 times</strong> more accurate than the previous best, recorded 14 years ago, and confirms the Standard Model’s predictions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is an electron’s magnetic moment?</strong></p>
<p>In atomic physics, the electron magnetic moment, or more specifically the electron magnetic dipole moment, is the magnetic moment of an electron resulting from its intrinsic properties of spin and electric charge.</p>
<p><strong>What is Standard Model of Physics?</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Standard Model</strong> has successfully predicted the <strong>existence and properties of dozens of particles</strong> and is one of the most successful theories in the history of physics.</p>
<ul>
<li>It determines how the particles are affected by <strong>three of the four fundamental forces</strong> of nature: strong-nuclear force, weak nuclear force, and electromagnetic force (it can’t explain gravity)</li>
<li>However, it still cannot explain <strong>why the universe has more matter than antimatter</strong>, what dark matter is, or what dark energy is.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/statndard.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/statndard.jpg?is-pending-load=1" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Significance of the new measurement</strong>: It precisely confirms the standard model of particle physics theories, thus giving it more credibility</p>
<p><strong>Limitations</strong>: Several other properties of subatomic particles are yet to be tested</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: <strong>Puducherry</strong> has launched the country’s <strong>first Marine Spatial Planning (MSP)</strong> framework to balance growth alongside sustainable management of ocean resources</p>
<ul>
<li>It is part of a pact under the <strong>Indo-Norway Integrated Ocean Initiative</strong></li>
<li><strong>Puducherry and Lakshadweep</strong> were chosen as coastlines to pilot the MSP initiative in 2019</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is Marine Spatial Planning framework?</strong></p>
<p>It provides guidelines/ ways to effectively plan human activities for sustainable marine utilization and achieve ecological, economic and social objectives.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO</strong> provides guidelines for ecosystem-based MSP for countries </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Significance:</strong> MSP would serve as a <strong>vital governance tool</strong> in ensuring the emergence of a blue economy characterised by sustainable and equitable ocean resource management, instead of an environmentally unsustainable “<strong>brown economy</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: As per a recent finding, Thwaites Glacier in Antarctica is in peril as warm ocean water has entered its weak points.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thwaites Glacier</strong> might contribute to a rise in sea level of <strong>more than half a metre</strong> and further destabilise the nearby glaciers, which can add another three metres to the surge.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Thwaites Glacier:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thwaites Glacier</strong> is an unusually broad and vast Antarctic glacier flowing into Pine Island Bay, part of the <strong>Amundsen Sea</strong></li>
<li>Currently, the Thwaites contribute <strong>four per cent to the average sea-level rise</strong> rate of 1.5 inches per decade</li>
<li>It is called ‘<strong>Doomsday Glacier’</strong> as it is one of the most unstable (roughly the size of Florida (US)) and its collapse could drive catastrophic sea level rise</li>
</ul>
<p>A remotely controlled <strong>Icefin (underwater robot)</strong> is contributing to the research.</p>
