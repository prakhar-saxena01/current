<h4 id="gs-paper-2"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-rejects-plea-seeking-to-bar-candidates-from-contesting-elections-from-more-than-one-seat/article66462561.ece"><strong>Th</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Supreme Court has <strong>refused to set aside a provision in the election law</strong> which allows candidates to contest polls from two constituencies simultaneously.</p>
<ul>
<li>Previously, a petition had sought the court to declare <strong>Section 33(7) of the</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/salient-features-of-the-representation-of-peoples-act/"><strong>Representation of People Act</strong></a> <strong>invalid and ultra vires.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why has SC rejected the Plea?</strong> </p>
<p>The SC said that <strong>this is a policy matter and an issue concerning political democracy</strong>. It is for the Parliament to take a call (thus maintaining the Separation of Power Doctrine).</p>
<p><strong>Legal Provisions:</strong></p>
<p><strong>As per Section 33(7) of the</strong> <strong>RPA (Representation of the People Act)</strong><strong>, 1951</strong>, one candidate can contest from a <strong>maximum of two constituencies</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>More than two constituencies were allowed until 1996 when the RPA was amended to set the cap at two constituencies.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Issues with contesting from two seats:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Conflicts in the RPA laws</strong>: While <strong>33(7)</strong>allows candidates to contest from two seats, <strong>Section 70</strong> bars candidates from representing two constituencies in the Lok Sabha/state. Assembly.</li>
<li><strong>The strain on public finances</strong>: Lakhs of taxpayer rupees need to be shelled out because of a by-election that could have been easily avoided.</li>
<li><strong>Loss of electoral interest of voters</strong>: Repeated elections and a by-election would see fewer voters turn out to vote when compared to the first election.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Positives</strong>: It provides a “wider choice to the polity as well as candidates”. </p>
<p><strong>Previous Recommendations on the issues:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Last year the <strong>Chief Election Commissioner</strong>had asked the Ministry of Law &amp; Justice to limit the seats from which a candidate can contest to just one.</li>
<li><strong>Candidates to bear the financial burden</strong> of conducting the subsequent by-election in one of the constituencies (if one wins in both seats) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>It is time to modify <strong>“One person, one vote</strong>” and expand that principle to <strong>“One person, one vote; one candidate, one constituency.</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Consider the following statements: (UPSC 2020)</strong> </p>
<ol>
<li>According to the Constitution of India, a person who is eligible to vote can be made a minister in a State for six months even if he/she is not a member of the Legislature of that State.</li>
<li>According to the Representation of People Act, 1951, a person convicted of a criminal offence and sentenced to imprisonment for five years is permanently disqualified from contesting an election even after his release from prison.</li>
</ol>
<p>Which of the statements given above is/are correct?</p>
<p>(a) 1 only<br />
(b) 2 only<br />
(c) Both 1 and 2<br />
(d) Neither 1 nor 2</p>
<p><strong>Ans: D</strong></p>
<p>One can be a minister for 6 months (Article 164). However, one can become a member of the state legislature only if one must be not less than 30 years of age in the case of the legislative council and not less than 25 years of age in the case of the legislative assembly. <strong>Hence, statement 1 is not correct.</strong></p>
<p>A person convicted of any offence and sentenced to imprisonment for <strong>not less than two years</strong> shall be disqualified for contesting an election from the date of such conviction and shall continue to be disqualified for a further period of <strong>six years since his release</strong>. Hence, statement 2 is not correct.</p>

<h4 id="gs-paper-2_1"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Indian Constitution</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/centre-sowing-seeds-of-militancy-in-ladakh-by-alienating-the-youth-sonam-wangchuk/article66463322.ece"><strong>TH</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Sonam Wangchuk claimed that the Centre’s approach was alienating the youth by sowing the seeds of militancy as <strong>the demand for the preservation of land, culture, and jobs under the</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/issues-related-to-sc-st/constitutional-safeguards-for-sts/the-sixth-schedule-of-the-constitution/"><strong>6th Schedule</strong></a> of the Constitution grew in Ladakh.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>On August 5, 2019</strong>, the former State of J&amp;K was bifurcated into two Union Territories (UTs) – J&amp;K and Ladakh, the latter without a Legislative Assembly.</li>
<li>After its special status (under Article 370) was removed, <strong>several political groups in Ladakh have been demanding</strong> protection under the 6th Schedule.</li>
<li>According to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs report, as the tribal population in the UT is <strong>~80%</strong> (2,18,355) <strong>of the total population, the special status may be granted</strong> (under the 5th/6th Schedule) to the UT.</li>
<li>However, the <strong>Union government responded</strong> that sufficient funds are being provided to UT and the UT had recently increased the <strong>reservation for STs</strong> in direct recruitment from 10% to 45%.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/12/11/6th-schedule-of-the-indian-constitution/">The Schedule</a> <strong>protects tribal populations</strong>, providing autonomy to communities through the creation of <strong>Autonomous Development Councils</strong> (ADCs), which can frame laws on land, public health and agriculture.</li>
<li>According to <strong>Article 244</strong> of the Indian Constitution, the Sixth Schedule consists of provisions for the administration of tribal areas in <strong>Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram.</strong><ul>
<li>As of now, <strong>10</strong> autonomous councils exist in the above 4 states.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Along with ADCs, the 6th Schedule also provides for separate <strong>Regional Councils</strong> for each area constituted as an autonomous region.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Concerns raised by Sonam Wangchuk and others:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>12,000 jobs were promised but the recruitment was completed only for 800 positions.</li>
<li>Common people and journalists were <strong>booked for raising their voices in favour of the 6th Schedule</strong>.</li>
<li>Earlier the UT had four MLAs in the State Assembly (J&amp;K] <strong>but now has zero representation</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>One man</strong> (L-G, who is an outsider) decides everything and 90% of the ₹6,000 crores allocated to Ladakh is at the dispensation of a non-elected person.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Demands of civil society/political groups in the region:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Restoration of full-fledged Statehood,</li>
<li>Constitutional safeguards under the Sixth Schedule,</li>
<li>Separate Lok Sabha seats for Leh and Kargil districts and</li>
<li>Job reservation for locals</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The legitimate concerns raised by the UT need to be addressed soon, otherwise love for India will subside and will benefit those looking to cause trouble.</p>

<p><strong>Direction:</strong> The article highlights the implications of reduced allocations for the social sector program in the Union Budget 2023-24.</p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> The Union Budget 2023-24 reiterates the strategic vision of the government in which both economic recovery and job creation rest on increased capital expenditure (capex) while welfare segment has taken a toll.</p>
<p><strong>The Budget announcements:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Increase in capex and its implications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A capex of ₹10 lakh crore</strong>, a 33% increase over last year.</li>
<li>The budget estimate (BE) for effective capex is now is <strong>4.</strong><strong>5%</strong> <strong>of the GDP</strong>, up from 3.9% last year.</li>
<li>Government remains on its ‘<strong>path of fiscal consolidation</strong>,’ with the <strong>fiscal deficit</strong> for FY24 projected to be <strong>5.</strong><strong>9% of the GDP</strong> (<strong>6.4%</strong> for the current year).</li>
<li>The Finance Minister reiterated the commitment to reach <strong>a fiscal deficit below 4.5% by 2025-26.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Critic</strong>: essential schemes that provide a safety net and contribute to better human development outcomes have been <strong>underfunded</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Decreased allocations for social sector programs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>For subsidy:</strong> The BE for food subsidy is ₹<strong>1.</strong><strong>97</strong> <strong>lakh</strong> crore compared to the revised estimate (RE) of <strong>₹2.8</strong> lakh crore for 2022-23 (withdrawal of <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/welfare-schemes/schemes-under-ministry-of-consumer-affairs/pradhan-mantri-gareeb-kalyan-anna-yojana/#:~:text=Part%20of%20the%20scheme%2C%20the,1%20kg%20Gram%20per%20month."><strong>Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana</strong></a><strong>)</strong></li>
<li><strong>For</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2020/11/19/mahatama-gandhi-national-rural-employment-guarantee-scheme-mgnregs/"><strong>MGNREGS</strong></a> also seen a massive budget cut (BE for 2023-24 is ₹60,000 crore compared to the RE of ₹89,400 crore for 2022-23).</li>
<li><strong>For programmes that provide nutritional support for women and children:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>For Saksham Anganwadi</strong>, which includes <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Making-Anganwadi-Centres-Smart.pdf">anganwadi</a> services, <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/POSHAN-Abhiyaan.pdf">Poshan Abhiyan</a> and a scheme for adolescent girls, allocation remains almost the same at ₹20,554 crore.</li>
<li>The school meals scheme, rechristened <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/10/01/pm-poshan-shakti-nirman-scheme/"><strong>PM-POSHAN</strong></a>, has seen a slight decline.</li>
<li><strong>Samarthya</strong>, the maternity entitlements scheme, has been allocated ₹2,582 crore compared to the previous year’s allocation of ₹2,622 crore (BE).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>For other initiatives:</strong><ul>
<li>The allocations for old age, widow and disabled pensions under the <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/social-justice/welfare-schemes/schemes-under-ministry-of-rural-development/national-social-assistance-programme/#:~:text=National%20Social%20Assistance%20Programme%20is,to%20below%20poverty%20line%20households."><strong>National Social Assistance Programme</strong></a> have remained stagnant (around ₹9,600 crore).</li>
<li>The important areas in the social sector – <strong>education and health</strong> – have not seen any substantial increase.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implications of these decreased allocations:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Way ahead:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To achieve the spending goals set by the national policies on education (6% of GDP) and health <strong>(2.5%</strong> of GDP), <strong>the allocations need to be doubled.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The removal of barriers</strong> to the timely and appropriate implementation of social sector programs is necessary, along with an increase in budgetary support.<ul>
<li><strong>For example</strong>, the app-based attendance monitoring system to ensure timely and error-free payments under MGNREGS.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It must be acknowledged that spending on these various social sector efforts significantly contributes to both economic recovery and long-term improvements in people’s lives.</li>
<li>India cannot achieve the vision for <strong>Amrit Kaal</strong> without ensuring access to quality and affordable education, health, nutrition and social security.</li>

<p><strong>What exactly is the proposed change?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Finance Bill 2023, has proposed to amend Section 56(2) VII B of the <strong>Income Tax Act.</strong></li>
<li>According to the clause (introduced in 2012 and commonly known as the ‘angel tax’), equity investments from <strong>residents</strong> for the issuance of shares at a price above their face value are treated as <strong>income</strong> for unlisted businesses like start-ups.<ul>
<li><strong>For instance</strong>, if a start-up share has a fair market value of Rs 10 per unit and is sold to an investor for Rs 20 during a subsequent funding round, the difference of Rs 10 would be taxable as income (<strong>at 30%</strong>).</li>
<li>By subscribing to shares of a closely held company at a price over the shares’ fair market value, <strong>it aims to prevent the creation and use of unaccounted money.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>However, with the latest amendment, the government has proposed <strong>to also include foreign investors in the ambit</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why are start-ups concerned?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>According to a PwC India report, <strong>funding for India’s start-ups dropped</strong> by 33% to $24 billion in 2022 as compared to the previous year.</li>
<li><strong>Foreign investors are a key source of funding</strong> for start-ups and have played a big role in increasing the valuation.<ul>
<li>For instance, <strong>Tiger Global</strong> has invested in over a third of the start-ups that have turned unicorns (valuation of at least $1 billion).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The proposed amendment <strong>will accelerate flipping overseas,</strong> as foreign investors may not want to deal with additional tax liability.</li>

<p><strong>Key highlights:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A nine-member committee</strong> has been formed to <strong>suggest remedial measures</strong> for preventing environmental damage to the town.</li>
<li>A <strong>study on Mussoorie’s carrying capacity by the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration in 2001</strong> suggested that <strong>no further construction was viable.</strong></li>
<li>An analysis <strong>of the carrying capacity of eco-sensitive areas in Himalayan regions in a holistic manner</strong> is necessary for the protection of the environment.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>About Carrying Capacity:</strong></p>
<p>The total number of <strong>individuals of a species that can live in an ecosystem under certain conditions</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>More recently the concept has been expanded beyond ecology by including <strong>economic, social, and infrastructure imperatives.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Urban Carrying Capacity (UCC):</strong> It provides a theoretical foundation for dete<strong>rmining the maximum potential population that could be supported without environmental degradation, based on the inherent limitations of a city</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Global Practices on Urban Carrying Capacity:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Who is a Puisne Judge:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The term puisne judge is used in common law countries to <strong>refer to judges who are ranked lower in seniority, i.e., any judge other than the Chief Justice of that court.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Common law</strong> is the body of law that is <strong>created by judges through their written opinions, rather than through statutes or constitutions (statutory law).</strong> Common law, which is used interchangeably with ‘case law’, is based on judicial precedent. The United Kingdom (UK) and the Commonwealth countries, <strong>including India, are common law countries.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Puisne Judge in India:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In India, <strong>all judges have the same judicial powers</strong>. As the seniormost judge of a court, <strong>the Chief Justice has an additional administrative role</strong>.</li>
<li>In India, there is a <strong>reference to a puisne judge only while considering the order of seniority for appointments, elevations to High Courts, etc</strong>., but it does not have a bearing on the exercise of a judge’s judicial power.</li>

<p>Context:  US President Joe Biden believes that the India-US initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies, or iCET, is key for the two countries to create a democratic technology ecosystem</p>
<p><strong>Outcomes of the meeting:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Establish Indo-US Quantum Coordination Mechanism</strong> for collaboration in R&amp;D</li>
<li><strong>‘Innovative bridge’</strong> to connect defence startups between India and USA launched</li>
<li><strong>Readiness Assessment Development</strong> for building resilient <strong>semiconductor supply chains</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other key points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>STEM talent</strong> exchanges between the two countries</li>
<li><strong>ISRO-NASA partnership</strong> on human space flight e.g. on NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services (<strong>CLPS</strong>) Project (apart from the NISAR project)</li>
<li><strong>Partnership in 56/6G</strong> and <strong>Open RAN</strong> using trusted sources</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is Open RAN?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Open RAN (open radio access network architecture) offers</strong> higher interoperability through open hardware, software, and interfaces for cellular wireless networks.</p>
<ul>
<li>With 5G networks being rolled out across countries, Open RAN technologies have quickly gained momentum, offering operators more flexibility, automation, and lower costs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>More about iCET:</strong></p>
<p>It was announced in <strong>2021.</strong> iCET is spearheaded by the <strong>National Security Councils</strong> <strong>of both countries.</strong></p>
<p>It aims to expand the <strong>India-US partnership for critical and emerging technologies</strong>– that will drive global growth, bolster both countries’ economic competitiveness, and protect shared national security interests.</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: Scientists have uncovered a <strong>new thalattosuchian—an ancient “cousin” of modern-day crocodiles</strong>—which could be the oldest of its kind ever discovered.</p>
<p><strong>About Thalattosuchian:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The newly-discovered fossils of <strong>Turnersuchus hingleyae</strong> represent <strong>the only complete Thalattosuchian of its age and date back to the early Jurassic, Pliensbachian period</strong>, which was about 185 million years ago.</li>
<li>The <strong>discovery of this new fossil helps fill a gap in the fossil record</strong> and suggests that Thalattosuchians and other crocodile-like animals could have originated around 15 million years farther than Turnersuchus.</li>
<li>Due to their <strong>relatively long, slender snouts</strong>, <strong>they would likely have looked similar to the currently living gharial crocodiles</strong>. Gharial crocodiles are usually found in the major river <strong>systems of Northern India.</strong> </li>
