<p><strong>Context:</strong> The <strong>Uttarakhand Competitive Examination (Measures For Control and Prevention of Unfair Means in Recruitment) Ordinance, 2023</strong>, which has provisions of fines up to <strong>Rs 10 crore</strong> and life imprisonment for the guilty has been given nod by the governor</p>
<ul>
<li>There have been <strong>continuous agitations against multiple paper leaks in Uttarakhand since 2016</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Provisions of the anti-cheating law</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Applicable to:</strong> public examinations for <strong>recruitment to posts under the state government, autonomous bodies run by the government</strong>, and authorities, corporations, and institutions operated with grants of the state government.</li>

<h4 id="gs-paper-2_1"><strong>GS Paper 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Syllabus:</strong> <strong>Constitution of India – significant provision; Structure, organisation and functioning of the Executive</strong></p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.livemint.com/news/india/president-droupadi-murmu-appoints-new-governors-for-various-states-full-list-11676179456971.html"><strong>LM</strong></a> </p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Twelve states and the UT of Ladakh will have new Governors including both first-time appointments as well as transfers of Governors from one state to the other.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/polity/functions-and-responsibilities-of-the-union-and-the-states-issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure-devolution-of-powers-and-finances-up-to-local-levels-and-challenges-therein/issues-and-challenges-pertaining-to-the-federal-structure/governors-role/"><strong>Appointment of the Governor</strong></a> <strong>– Constitutional provisions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Article 153:</strong> There shall be a Governor for each State and the same <strong>person can be the Governor for two/more States</strong> (2nd part added through an amendment in 1956).</li>
<li><strong>Article 155</strong>: Governor of a State shall be <strong>appointed by the President</strong> by warrant under his hand and seal.</li>
<li><strong>Article 156:</strong> The Governor shall hold office during the <strong>pleasure of the President</strong>, but his normal term of office <strong>will be five years</strong>.<ul>
<li>Since the President acts on the aid and advice of the PM and the Union Council of Ministers, <strong>the Governor is appointed and removed by the central government.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Articles 157 and 158</strong>:<ul>
<li><strong>Qualification:</strong> The Governor must be a <strong>citizen of India</strong> and should have completed the age of <strong>35</strong></li>
<li><strong>Condition of office:</strong> The Governor should not be a member of Parliament or a state legislature, and <strong>must not hold any other office of profit.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/03/12/insights-into-editorial-the-office-of-the-governor/"><strong>Relationship between the Governor and the state government:</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The position of the Governor is envisaged as <strong>an apolitical head</strong> who must <strong>act on the advice</strong> of the Council of Ministers of the state <strong>(Article 163).</strong></li>
<li>However, the Governor enjoys certain <strong>discretionary powers</strong> under the Constitution, such as<ul>
<li>Giving or withholding <strong>assent to a Bill</strong> passed by the state legislature;</li>
<li>Determining the <strong>time needed for a party to prove its majority</strong> in the state Assembly;</li>
<li>In cases of a <strong>hung verdict</strong> in an election, which party must be called first to prove its majority</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Analysing the functioning of the Governor’s office over the years:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Over the decades, Governors have been <strong>seen</strong> (especially by those in opposition) <strong>as acting –</strong><ul>
<li><strong>At the behest of the central government</strong></li>
<li>As “<strong>agents of the Centre</strong>”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why does such</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/01/07/insights-into-editorial-maximum-governor-on-governors-role/"><strong>friction</strong></a> <strong>take place?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Governors have become <strong>political appointees</strong></li>
<li>The Governor is answerable to no one except the Centre</li>
<li>There is <strong>no provision for impeaching the Governor</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Sarkaria Commission (1983):</strong> The appointee shall be an eminent person.</li>
<li><strong>The National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution (2000):</strong> A time limit, preferably six months to give assent or to reserve a Bill for consideration of the President.</li>
<li><strong>The Punchhi Commission (2007):</strong> Amend Article 156 to provide a procedure to remove the Governor from office.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> There are no guidelines for how the Governor and the state must interact when there is a disagreement. Respect for each other’s boundaries, which has traditionally been a practice, should serve as guidance in this.</p>

<p><strong>Source</strong>: <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/meity-may-soon-integrate-chatgpt-with-whatsapp-for-key-government-schemes-8441010/">IE</a></p>
<p><strong>What is ChatGPT?</strong></p>
<p>ChatGPT is an <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/science-technology/robotics/artificial-intelligence-and-robotics/"><strong>AI</strong></a><strong>-powered chatbot</strong> developed by the <strong>AI startup OpenAI.</strong> The technology functions by leveraging extensive data to learn how to respond to user prompt in a human-like manner, providing information similar to a search engine. </p>
<p><strong>What is a Chatbot?</strong></p>
<p>A chatbot is a software that simulates <strong>human-like conversations</strong> with users via chat. </p>
<p><strong>A chatGPT-based chatbot can help rural India in several ways:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Providing access to information</strong>: E.g. healthcare, education, agriculture, and government schemes.<ul>
<li>In a recent demo, the Chatbot seamlessly responded to a query on <strong>PM Awas Yojana</strong>– made through a voice note.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Improving access to services</strong>: E.g. banking, insurance, and healthcare. This can help bridge the gap between urban and rural areas and improve the quality of life for rural residents.</li>
<li><strong>Providing language support</strong>: It supports multiple languages. More languages are being integrated through <a href="https://bhashini.gov.in/en/"><strong>Bhashini Daan Mission</strong></a>.</li>
<li><strong>Enhancing</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Financial-Inclusion-in-India.pdf"><strong>financial inclusion</strong></a><strong>:</strong> By promoting financial literacy and encouraging savings among rural residents.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steps to overcome limitations</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Government is yet to build a <strong>National Digital public platform</strong> for Indian languages</li>
<li><strong>Reducing the</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/science-technology/communication-and-it-technology/digital-divide/"><strong>digital divide</strong></a> in rural India</li>
<li>Enabling access to affordable <strong>technology</strong></li>
<li>Reducing <strong>behavioural resistance</strong> to new technologies</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>A chatGPT-based chatbot can help to improve the quality of life for rural residents by providing access to information and services that are otherwise difficult to obtain.</p>
<p><a href="https://bhashini.gov.in/en/"><strong>BHASHINI Mission</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Under Bhashini</strong> Mission, a team at MeitY is currently building a <strong>WhatsApp-based chatbot</strong> that relies on information generated by ChatGPT to return appropriate responses to queries.</p>
<p>BHASHINI Mission is a <strong>local language translation mission</strong> that aims to enable <strong>easy access to the internet and digital services</strong> in Indian languages, including voice-based access, and help the creation of content in Indian languages.</p>
<p>It will also provide AI-based resources to Indian MSMEs, startups and innovators in the public domain</p>
<p><strong>What is Bhasha Daan?</strong></p>
<p>It is an ambitious project which aims to crowdsource voice datasets in multiple Indian languages as part of <strong>Project BHASHINI</strong>.</p>
<p>On the project’s website, people can contribute in three key ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>By recording their voice samples in multiple Indian languages</li>
<li>By typing out a sentence being played</li>
<li>By translating text from one language into another.</li>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: MicroLEDs are considered the next big transition in display technology as many big tech companies are shifting towards it.</p>
<p><strong>About MicroLEDs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>micro-LEDs are <strong>self-illuminating diodes</strong> that have <strong>brighter and better colour reproduction</strong> than Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) display technology.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The technology behind it:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A microLED is as <strong>small as cutting a centimetre of hair into 200 smaller pieces</strong>.</li>
<li>Each of these <strong>micro LEDs is a semiconductor that receives electric signals</strong>. Once these micro LEDs are gathered, they form a module. Several modules are then combined to form screens.</li>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: An Oxford study has found that the Norwegian Arctic ice is contaminated with alarming levels of toxic PFAS (Per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances, also called “forever chemicals”).</p>
<p><strong>Impact of PFAS:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>These chemicals are <strong>persistent and can</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/basic-concepts-of-ecosystem/bioaccumulation-biomagnification/"><strong>bioaccumulate</strong></a> in living organisms, potentially causing health and environmental risks.</li>
<li><strong>Risk of further contamination:</strong> The chemicals can move from glaciers into downstream ecosystems like Arctic fjords and tundra.</li>
<li><strong>It affects the entire</strong> <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/environment/basic-concepts-of-ecosystem/trophic-level-food-chain-food-web/food-chain-and-food-web/"><strong>food web</strong></a>, including plankton, fish, seal and apex animals like polar bears, and thus impact local communities</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is PFAS?</strong></p>
<p>PFAS are a <strong>class of about 12,000 chemicals</strong> often used to make thousands of consumer products resist water, stains and heat.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>They are called “forever chemicals</strong>” because they do not naturally break down, and they are linked to cancer, liver disease, kidney stress, fetal complications and other serious health problems.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Uses</strong>: They are used in cosmetics (hair conditioner, foundation cream, sunscreen etc.), electronics (smartphones), textiles (waterproof clothing), utensils (non-stick pan) etc.</p>
